and flattened out,\\n                To shun the fragments flung about.\\n                Some rogues were lifted from their feet\\n    And, turning somersaults complete,\\n    Like leaves went twirling through the air\\n    But only to receive a scare;\\n    And ere the smoke away had cleared\\n    In forest shade they disappeared.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    While Brownies passed along the street,\\n    Commenting on the summer\\'s heat\\n    That wrapped the city day and night,\\n    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.\\n    Said one: \"Of all the sights we\\'ve found,\\n    Since we commenced to ramble round,\\n    This seems to better suit the band\\n    Than anything, however grand.\\n    We\\'ll rest awhile and find our way\\n    Inside the place without delay,\\n    And those who understand the art,\\n    Can knowledge to the rest impart;\\n        For every one should able be,\\n        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.\\n        We never know how soon we may,\\n        See some one sinking in dismay,--\\n        And then, to have the power to save\\n    A comrade from a watery grave,\\n    Will be a blessing sure to give\\n    Us joy the longest day we live.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The doors soon opened through the power\\n    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.\\n    When once within the fun began,\\n    As here and there they quickly ran;\\n    Some up the stairs made haste to go,\\n    Some into dressing-rooms below,\\n    In bathing-trunks to reappear\\n    And plunge into the water clear;\\n    Some from the spring-board leaping fair\\n    Would turn a somersault in air;\\n    More to the bottom like a stone,\\n    Would sink as soon as left alone,\\n    While others after trial brief\\n    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Some all their time to others gave\\n    Assisting them to ride the wave,\\n    Explaining how to catch the trick,\\n    Both how to strike and how to kick;\\n    And still keep nose above the tide,\\n    That lungs with air might be supplied.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Thus diving in and climbing out,\\n    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,\\n    The happy band in water played\\n    As long as Night her scepter swayed.\\n    They heard the clocks in chapel towers\\n    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.\\n    But when the sun looked from his bed\\n    To tint the eastern sky with red,\\n    In haste the frightened Brownies threw\\n    Their clothes about them and withdrew.\\n\\n[Illustration: TIME FLIES]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray\\n    Around a wide but shallow bay,\\n    Not far from shore, to their surprise,\\n    They saw a whale of monstrous size,\\n      That, favored by the wind and tide,\\n      Had ventured in from ocean wide,\\n      But waves receding by-and-by,\\n      Soon left him with a scant supply.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            At times, with flaps and lunges strong\\n            He worked his way some yards along,\\n            Till on a bar or sandy marge\\n            He grounded like a leaden barge.\\n            \"A chance like this for all the band,\"\\n            Cried one, \"but seldom comes to hand.\\n            I know the bottom of this bay\\n            Like those who made the coast survey.\\n            \\'Tis level as a threshing-floor\\n            And shallow now from shore to shore;\\n            That creature\\'s back will be as dry\\n    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,\\n    Till morning tide                 comes full and free\\n    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea.\"\\n    \"I catch the hint!\"               another cried;\\n    \"Let all make haste               to gain his side\\n            Then clamber up as best we may,\\n            And ride him round till break of day.\"\\n                         At once, the band in great delight\\n                         Went splashing through the water bright,\\n                         And soon to where he rolled about\\n                         They lightly swam, or waded out.\\n                         Now climbing up, the Brownies tried\\n            To take position for the ride.\\n            Some lying down a hold maintained;\\n            More, losing place as soon as gained,\\n            Were forced a dozen times to scale\\n            The broad side of the stranded whale.\\n            Now half-afloat and half-aground\\n            The burdened monster circled round,\\n    Still groping clumsily about\\n    As if to find the channel out,\\n    And Brownies clustered close, in fear\\n    That darker moments might be near.\\n    And soon the dullest in the band\\n    Was sharp enough to understand\\n    The creature was no longer beached,\\n    But deeper water now had reached.\\n    For plunging left, or plunging right,\\n    Or plowing downward in his might,\\n    The fact was plain, as plain could be--\\n    The whale was working out to sea!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    A creeping fear will seize the mind\\n    As one is leaving shores behind,\\n    And knows the bark whereon he sails\\n    Is hardly fit to weather gales.\\n    Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,\\n    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;\\n    While they can see, with living eye,\\n    The terrors of the air sweep by.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        For who would not a fierce bird dread,\\n        If it came flying at his head?\\n        And these were hungry, squawking things,\\n        With open beaks and flapping wings.\\n        They made the Brownies dodge and dip,\\n        Into the sea they feared to slip.\\n    The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,\\n    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.\\n    The lobster, with his ready claw;\\n    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;\\n    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,\\n    Averse to every social call;\\n    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,\\n    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,\\n    All these increase the landsman\\'s fright,\\n    As shores are fading out of sight.\\n    Such fear soon gained complete command\\n    Of every Brownie in the band.\\n    They looked behind, where fair and green\\n    The grassy banks and woods were seen.\\n    They looked ahead, where white and cold\\n    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,\\n    And then, with woful faces drew\\n    Comparisons between the two.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Some blamed themselves for action rash\\n    Against all reason still to dash\\n    In danger\\'s way, and never think\\n    Until they stood on ruin\\'s brink.\\n    While others threw the blame on those\\n    Who did the risky trip propose.\\n    But meantime deep and deeper still\\n    The whale was settling down until\\n    His back looked like an island small\\n    That scarce gave standing-room to all.\\n    But, when their chance seemed slight indeed\\n    To sport again o\\'er dewy mead,\\n    The spouting whale, with movement strong,\\n    Ran crashing through some timbers long\\n    That lumbermen had strongly tied\\n    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    \\'Twas then, in such a trying hour,\\n    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.\\n    The diving whale gave little time\\n    For them to choose a stick to climb,--\\n    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,\\n    However high the logs were tossed;\\n    By happy chance the boom remained\\n    That to the nearest shore was chained,\\n    And o\\'er that bridge the Brownies made\\n    A safe retreat to forest shade.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES\\' KITES.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The sun had hardly taken flight\\n    Unto the deepest caves of night;\\n    Or fowls secured a place of rest\\n    Where Reynard\\'s paw could not molest,\\n    When Brownies gathered to pursue\\n    Their plans regarding pleasures new.\\n    Said one: \"In spite of hand or string,\\n        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,\\n        Exposing heads to gusts of air,\\n    That ill the slightest draught can bear;\\n    While, high above the tallest tower,\\n    At morning, noon, and evening hour,\\n    The youngsters\\' kites with streaming tails\\n    Are riding out the strongest gales.\\n    The doves in steeples hide away\\n        Or keep their houses through the day,\\n        Mistaking every kite that flies\\n        For bird of prey of wondrous

   \"You\\'re not alone,\" another cried,\\n        \"In taking note. I, too, have spied\\n        The boys of late, in street and court,\\n        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;\\n        But yesternight I chanced to see\\n        A kite entangled in a tree.\\n        The string was nowhere to be found;\\n        The tail about a bough was wound.\\n        Some birds had torn the paper out,\\n        To line their nests, in trees about,\\n        But there beside the wreck I staid,\\n        Until I learned how kites are made.\\n        On me you safely may depend,\\n        To show the way to cut and bend.\\n        So let us now, while winds are

Perhaps some youthful angler whines\\n        About his missing fishing-lines.\\n    But let them find                   things where they will,\\n    The Brownies must                   be furnished

Before the kites, with string and tail,\\n        Were all prepared to ride the gale;\\n        And oh, the climax of their glee\\n        Was reached when kites were floating free!\\n        So quick

way.\\n    But as they neared a building high,\\n    Surprise was shown in every eye.\\n    They heard the strains of music sweet,\\n    And tripping of the dancers\\' feet;\\n    While o\\'er the tap of heel and toe,\\n    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,\\n    Arose the clear and ringing call\\n    Of those who had control of all.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,\\n    Then gathered closely round the place,\\n            To study out some way to win\\n            A peep or two at those within.\\n            Said one: \"In matters of this kind\\n            Opinions differ, you will find.\\n            And some might say, with sober thought,\\n            That children should not thus be taught\\n            To hop around on toe and heel\\n            So actively to fiddle\\'s squeal,\\n                For fear \\'twould turn their minds away\\n                From graver duties of the day.\"\\n                Another said: \"The dancing art\\n                Doth ease to every move impart.\\n

made.\\n    In mystic ways, to Brownies known,\\n    They clambered up the walls of stone.\\n    They clung to this and that, like briers,\\n    They climbed the smooth electric wires;\\n    Some members lending ready aid\\n    To those who weaker nerves displayed.\\n    And in five minutes at the most,\\n    By vine, by bracket, and by post,\\n    By every scroll, and carving bold,\\n    That toes could touch or fingers hold\\n    They made their way, and gained a chance\\n    To view, unnoticed, every dance.\\n    Said one: \"How pleasant is the sight\\n    To see those children young and

in the spring of life,\\n    Of joys and countless blessings rife,\\n    Who yield themselves to Pleasure\\'s hand--\\n    So danced that night the Brownie Band.\\n    First one would take his place to show\\n    The special step for heel or toe,\\n    Just how to edge about with care,\\n    And help around the partner fair,\\n    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--\\n    To cause confusion and distress.\\n    Then more would play the master\\'s part,\\n    And give some lessons in the art:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        Would show the rest some figures new\\n        From Turkey, China, or Peru.\\n        Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,\\n    Then bob around, as if on springs,\\n    Until the sprightly steps would call\\n    Loud acclamations from them all.\\n    They danced in twos with skip and bound,\\n    They danced in circles, round and round;\\n    They danced in lines that coiled about\\n    As runs the serpent in and out,\\n    Some moving slow, some standing still--\\n    More cutting capers with a will.\\n    At length, by joining hand in hand,\\n    The set included all the band.\\n    A happier crowd was never seen\\n    On ball-room floor or village green.\\n    By turns they danced, by turns would go\\n    And try their skill at string and bow--\\n    They almost sawed the fiddle through,\\n    So fast the bow across it flew.\\n    And louder still the harp would ring,\\n    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.\\n    Alike they seemed a skillful band\\n    Upon the floor or music-stand.\\n    The night wore on, from hour to hour,\\n    And still they danced with vim and power;\\n    For supple-kneed and light of toe\\n    The Brownies are, as well you know,\\n    And such a thing as tiring out\\n    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.\\n    As long as darkness hung her pall\\n    In heavy folds around the hall,\\n    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,\\n    Until the very break of day.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    To dance the figures o\\'er and o\\'er,\\n    They lingered on the polished floor;\\n    No sooner was one party done\\n    Than others the position won.\\n    They chose their partners for the set,\\n    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    As night advanced, and morning gray\\n    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,\\n    The lively Brownies

Who still would struggle for a chance\\n                  To have, at least, another dance--\\n                  Some figure that was quite forgot,\\n                          Although \"the finest of

These racks may also be applied in the topmast and\\ntop-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives\\nfor sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these\\nracks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents\\nuncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which\\ncan be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged\\nmerely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a\\nconsiderable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.\\n\\nIt is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen\\nto the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will\\nhave returned into safety before any discharge takes place. It is\\nevident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be\\ncalculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the\\nfire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in\\nthe most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to\\nhave less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it\\nis impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships\\nenough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with\\nclouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power\\nof destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass\\nharmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats\\nin towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely\\nprecluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any\\nboat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth\\nshell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.

Mr. Hutchinson thought at one\\ntime[136] that they were due to a stomatitis or an alveolar\\nperiostitis, but he has since changed his mind as to that point,\\nbelieving now[137] that the syphilitic tooth is the result of an arrest\\nof development in the central or first-formed portion of the dentine.\\nThe incisors being made up of these lobes or denticles, and dwarfing of\\nthe middle one taking place, the two lateral ones fall together.',\n",

understand\\n    The creature was no longer beached,\\n    But deeper water now had reached.\\n    For plunging left, or plunging right,\\n    Or plowing downward in his might,\\n    The fact was plain, as plain could be--\\n    The whale was working out to sea!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    A creeping fear will seize the mind\\n    As one is leaving shores behind,\\n    And knows the bark

and the shrimp,\\n    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,\\n    All these increase the landsman\\'s fright,\\n    As shores are fading out of sight.\\n    Such fear soon gained complete command\\n    Of every Brownie in the band.\\n    They looked behind, where fair and green\\n    The grassy banks and woods were seen.\\n    They looked ahead, where white and cold\\n    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,\\n    And then, with woful faces drew\\n    Comparisons between the two.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Some blamed themselves for action rash\\n    Against all reason still to dash\\n    In

  More cutting capers with a will.\\n    At length, by joining hand in hand,\\n    The set included all the band.\\n    A happier crowd was never seen\\n    On ball-room floor or village green.\\n    By turns they danced, by turns would go\\n    And try their skill at string and bow--\\n    They almost sawed the fiddle through,\\n    So fast the bow across it flew.\\n    And louder still the harp would ring,\\n    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.\\n    Alike they seemed a skillful band\\n    Upon the floor or music-stand.\\n    The night wore on, from hour to hour,\\n    And still they danced with vim and power;\\n    For supple-kneed and light of toe\\n    The Brownies are, as well you know,\\n    And such a thing as tiring out\\n    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.\\n    As long as darkness hung her pall\\n    In heavy folds around the hall,\\n    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,\\n    Until the very break of day.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    To dance the figures o\\'er and o\\'er,\\n    They lingered on the polished floor;\\n    No sooner was one party done\\n    Than others the position won.\\n    They chose their partners for the set,\\n

Who still would struggle for a chance\\n                  To have, at least, another dance--\\n                  Some figure that was quite forgot,\\n                          Although \"the finest of

CANDY-PULL.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    One evening, while the Brownies sat\\n    Enjoying free and friendly chat,\\n    Some on the trees, some on the ground,\\n    And others perched on fences round--\\n    One Brownie, rising in his place,\\n    Addressed the band with beaming face.\\n    The listeners gathered with delight\\n    Around the member, bold and bright,\\n    To hear him tell

sport within.\\n                    At length, below the window-pane,\\n                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;\\n                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind\\n                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find\\n    The facts I can relate in full\\n    About that lively candy-pull.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    \"An hour or

learned how everything was done.\\n    The younger members took the lead,\\n    And carried on the work with speed.\\n    With nimble feet they ran about\\n    From place to place, with laugh and shout;\\n    But older heads looked on the while,\\n    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,\\n    And gave advice in manner kind\\n    To guide the inexperienced mind.\\n    They placed the sugar in a pot,\\n    And stirred it round till boiling hot;\\n    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,\\n    And stretched it out in shining bands,\\n    Until it reached across the floor,\\n    From mantel-piece to kitchen door.\\n\\n    \"These eyes of mine for many a night\\n    Have not beheld a finer sight.\\n    To pull the candy was the part\\n    Of some who seemed to know the art.\\n    The moon had slipped behind the hill,\\n    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;\\n    But still, with nose against the pane,\\n    I kept my place through wind and rain.\\n    There, perched upon the shaky pile,\\n    With bated breath I gazed the while.\\n    I watched them with the sharpest sight\\n    That I might tell the tale aright;\\n    For all the active youngsters there\\n    Appeared to have of work their share.\\n    Some put fresh sugar in the pot,\\n    Some kept the fire blazing hot,\\n    And worked away as best they could\\n    To keep the stove well filled with wood.\\n    Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,\\n    At moving here and there at will,\\n    Would have to \\'lively\\' be and \\'tear\\n    Around\\' to beat those children there!\\n    Some cut it up, more passed it round,\\n    While others ate it by the pound!\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    At this, a murmur of surprise\\n    On every side began to rise;\\n    Then smiles o\\'er every visage flitted,\\n    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,\\n    That told what train of thought had sped\\n    At once through every Brownie\\'s head--\\n    A thought of pleasure near at hand\\n    That well would suit the cunning band.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            The Brownies act without delay\\n            When new ideas cross their way,\\n            And soon one raised a finger small\\n            And close attention gained from all.\\n            They crowded near with anxious glance\\n            To learn what scheme he could advance--\\n    What methods mention or employ\\n    To bring about the promised joy.\\n    Said he: \"A vacant house is near.\\n    The owner leaves it every year\\n    For several months, and pleasure seeks\\n    On ocean waves

store around.\\n            The Brownie must be dull and tame,\\n            And scarce deserves to bear the name,\\n            Who will not join with heart and hand\\n            To carry out a scheme so grand.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Another cried: \"When to his bed\\n    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,\\n    Again we\\'ll muster in full force\\n    And to that building turn our

           And soon they paused, their eyes they raised\\n            And on the vacant mansion gazed.\\n    In vain the miser hides his store,\\n    In vain the merchant bars his door,\\n    In vain the locksmith changes keys--\\n    The Brownies enter where they please.\\n    Through iron doors, through gates of brass,\\n    And walls of stone they safely pass,\\n    And smile to think how soon they can\\n    Upset the studied schemes of man.\\n    Within that house, without delay,\\n    Behind the guide they worked their way,\\n    More happy far and full of glee\\n    Than was the owner, out at sea.\\n    The whale, the shark, or fish that flies\\n    Had less attraction for his eyes\\n    Than had the shining candy-balls\\n    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.\\n    Soon coal was from the cellar brought\\n    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;\\n    Then pots and pans came rattling in\\n    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.\\n    Just where the syrup had been found\\n    It matters not. It was around.\\n    The cunning band was soon possessed\\n    Of full supplies and of the best;\\n    Next tablespoons of silver fine\\n    In every hand appeared to shine,\\n    And ladles long, of costly ware,\\n    That had been laid away with care.\\n    No sooner was the syrup hot\\n    Than some around the kettle got,\\n    And dabbed away in eager haste\\n    To be the first to get a taste.\\n    Then some were scalded when the spoon\\n    Let fall its contents all too soon,\\n            And gave the tongue too warm a mess\\n            To carry without some distress.\\n            Then steps were into service brought\\n            That dancing-masters never taught,\\n            And smothered cries and swinging hand\\n            Would wake the wonder of the band.\\n            And when the candy boiled until\\n            It could be pulled and hauled at will,\\n    Take every shape or twist, and seem\\n    As free as fancy in a dream,\\n    The busy, happy-hearted crew\\n    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.\\n    The Brownies in the building stayed\\n    And candy ate as fast as made.\\n    But when at length the brightening sky\\n    Gave warning they must homeward fly,\\n    They quickly sought the open air\\n    And had but little time to spare.\\n    The shortest way, as often found,\\n    Was o\\'er the roughest piece of ground,\\n    Where rocks as large as houses lay\\n    All scattered round in wild array.\\n    Some covered o\\'er with clinging vines,\\n    Some bearing up gigantic pines,\\n    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,\\n    For centuries had stood the blast.\\n    But over all the rugged ground\\n    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,\\n    Now jumping clear from block to block,\\n    Now sliding down the shelving rock,\\n    Or cheering on the lagging kind\\n    Who here and there would fall behind.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                One night the Brownies found their way\\n                To where some tracks and switches lay,\\n                And buildings stood, such as are found\\n    In every town on railroad ground.\\n    They moved about from place to place,\\n    With prying eyes and cautious pace\\n    They peeped in shops and gained a view,\\n    Where cars were standing bright and new;\\n    While others, that had service known,\\n    And in some crash were overthrown,\\n    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,\\n    Were undergoing full repairs.\\n            The table that turns end for end\\n            Its heavy load, without a bend,\\n            Was next inspected through and through\\n            And tested by the wondering crew.\\n            They scanned the signal-lights with care\\n            That told the state of switches there,--\\n            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,\\n            Or simply to some siding led.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                Then round a locomotive strong\\n                They gathered in an earnest throng,\\n                Commenting on the style it showed,\\n                Its strength and speed upon the road.\\n                Said one: \"That \\'pilot\\' placed before\\n                Will toss a cow a block or more;\\n            You\\'d hardly find a bone intact\\n            When such a thing her frame has racked--\\n            Above the fence, and, if you please,\\n            Above the smoke-stack and the trees\\n            Will go the horns and heels in air,\\n            When hoisted by that same affair.\"\\n            \"Sometimes it saves,\" another cried,\\n            \"And throws an object far aside\\n            That would to powder have been ground,\\n            If rushing wheels a chance had found.\\n            I saw a goat tossed from the track\\n            And landed on a farmer\\'s stack,\\n            And though surprised at fate so strange,\\n            He seemed delighted at the change;\\n            And lived content, on best of fare,\\n            Until the farmer found him there.\"\\n    Another said: \"We\\'ll have some fun\\n    And down the road this engine run.\\n    The steam is up, as gauges show;\\n    She\\'s puffing, ready now to go;\\n    The fireman and the engineer\\n    Are at their supper, in the rear\\n    Of yonder shed.

  When people, dressed in fancy gear,\\n    From every quarter hurried down\\n    And filled the largest halls in town;\\n    And there to flute and fiddle sweet\\n    Went through their sets with lively feet.\\n    The Brownies were not slow to note\\n    That fun indeed was now afloat;\\n    And ere the season passed away,\\n    Of longest night and shortest day,\\n    They looked about to find a hall\\n    Where they could hold their fancy ball.\\n    Said one: \"A room can soon be found\\n    Where all the band can troop around;\\n    But want of costumes, much I fear,\\n    Will bar our pleasure all the year.\"\\n    Another said: \"One moment wait!\\n    My eyes have not been shut of late,--\\n    Don\\'t show a weak and hopeless mind\\n    Because your knowledge is confined,--\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    For I\\'m prepared to take the band\\n    To costumes, ready to the hand,\\n    Of every pattern, new or old:\\n    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,\\n    The cloak and plume of belted knight,\\n    The pilgrim\\'s hat and stockings white,\\n    The dresses for the ladies fair,\\n    The gems and artificial hair,\\n    The soldier-suits in blue and red,\\n    The turban for the Tartar\\'s head,\\n    All can be found where I will lead,\\n    If friends are willing to proceed.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Those knowing best the Brownie way\\n    Will know there was no long delay,\\n    Ere to the town he made a break\\n    With all the Brownies in his wake.\\n\\n    It mattered not that roads were long,\\n    That hills were high or winds were strong;\\n    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,\\n    And each one chose to suit himself.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The costumes, though a world too wide,\\n    And long enough a pair to hide,\\n    Were gathered in with skill and care,\\n    That showed the tailor\\'s art was there.\\n    Then out they started for the hall,\\n    In fancy trappings one and all;\\n    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;\\n    And some like kings; and more like clowns;\\n    And Highlanders, with naked knees;\\n    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;\\n    While many members in the line\\n    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,\\n    And swept along the polished floor\\n    A train that reached a yard or more.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    By happy chance some laid their hand\\n    Upon the outfit of a band;\\n    The horns and trumpets took the lead,\\n    Supported well by string and reed;\\n    And violins, that would have made\\n    A mansion for the rogues that played,\\n    With flute and clarionet combined\\n    In music of the gayest kind.\\n    In dances wild and strange to see\\n    They passed the hours in greatest glee;\\n    Familiar figures all were lost\\n    In flowing robes that round them tossed;\\n    And well-known faces hid behind\\n    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.\\n    The queen and clown, a loving pair,\\n    Enjoyed a light fandango there;\\n    While solemn monks of gentle heart,\\n    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.\\n                The grand salute, with courteous words,\\n                The bobbing up and down, like birds,\\n                The lively skip, the stately glide,\\n                The double turn, and twist aside\\n                Were introduced in proper place\\n                And carried through with ease and grace.\\n                So great the pleasure proved to all,\\n    Too long they tarried in the hall,\\n    And morning caught them on the fly,\\n    Ere they could put the garments by!\\n    Then dodging out in great dismay,\\n            By walls and stumps they made their way;\\n            And not until the evening\\'s shade\\n            Were costumes in their places laid.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    While Brownies strayed along a pier\\n    To view the shipping lying near,\\n    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;\\n    \\'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.\\n    Cried one: \"See what in black and red\\n    Below the pilot-house is spread!\\n    In honor of the Brownie Band,\\n    It bears our name in letters grand.\\n    Through all the day she\\'s on the go;\\n    Now with a laden scow in tow,\\n    And next with barges two or three,\\n    Then taking out a ship to sea,\\n    Or through the Narrows steaming round\\n    In search of vessels homeward bound;\\n    She\\'s stanch and true from stack to keel,\\n    And we should highly honored feel.\"\\n    Another said: \"An hour ago,\\n    The men went up to see a show,\\n    And left the tugboat lying here.\\n    The steam is up, our course is clear,\\n    We\\'ll crowd on board without delay\\n    And run her up and down the bay.\\n    We have indeed a special claim,\\n    Because she bears the \\'Brownie\\' name.\\n    Before the dawn creeps through the east\\n    We\\'ll know about her speed at least,\\n    And prove how such a craft behaves\\n    When cutting through the roughest waves.\\n    Behind the wheel I\\'ll take my stand\\n    And steer her round with skillful hand,\\n    Now down the river, now around\\n    The bay, or up the broader sound;\\n    Throughout the trip I\\'ll keep her clear\\n    Of all that might awaken fear.\\n    When hard-a-port the helm I bring,\\n    Or starboard make a sudden swing,\\n    The Band can rest as free from dread\\n    As if they slept on mossy bed.\\n    I something know about the seas,\\n    I\\'ve boxed a compass, if you please,\\n    And so can steer her east or west,\\n    Or north or south, as suits me best.\\n    Without the aid of twinkling stars\\n    Or light-house lamps, I\\'ll cross the bars.\\n    I know when north winds nip the nose,\\n    Or sou\\'-sou\\'-west the \\'pig-wind\\' blows,\\n    As hardy sailors call the gale\\n    That from that quarter strikes the sail.\"\\n\\n    A third replied: \"No doubt you\\'re smart\\n    And understand the pilot\\'s art,\\n    But more than one a hand should take,\\n    For all our lives will be at stake.\\n    In spite of eyes and ears and hands,\\n    And all the skill a crew commands,\\n    How oft collisions crush the keel\\n    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!\\n    Too many rocks around the bay\\n    Stick up their heads to bar the way.\\n    Too many vessels, long and wide,\\n    At anchor in the channel ride\\n    For us to show ourselves unwise\\n    And trust to but one pair of eyes.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear\\n    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,\\n    While many Brownies, young and old,\\n    From upper deck to lower hold\\n    Were crowding round in happy vein\\n    Still striving better views to gain.\\n    Some watched the waves around them roll;\\n    Some stayed below to shovel coal,\\n    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,\\n    They passed the rattling loads along.\\n    Some at the engine took a place,\\n    More to the pilot-house would race\\n    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,\\n    Or man the wheel as fancy led.\\n    But accidents we oft record,\\n    However well we watch and ward,\\n    And vessels often go to wreck\\n    With careful captains on the deck;\\n    They had mishaps that night, for still,\\n    In spite of all their care and skill,\\n    While running straight or turning round\\n    In river, bay, or broader sound,\\n    At times they ran upon a rock,\\n    And startled by the sudden shock\\n    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,\\n    Would spring at once across the rail;\\n    And then, repenting, find all hope\\n    Of life depended on a rope,\\n    That willing hands were quick to throw\\n    And hoist them from the waves below.\\n    Sometimes too near a ship they ran\\n    For peace of mind; again, their plan\\n    Would come to naught through lengthy tow\\n    Of barges passing to and fro.\\n    The painted buoys around the bay\\n    At times occasioned some dismay--\\n    They took them for torpedoes dread\\n    That might the boat in fragments spread,\\n    Awake the city\\'s slumbering crowds,\\n    And hoist the band among the clouds.\\n    But thus, till hints of dawn appeared\\n    Now here, now there, the boat was steered\\n    With many joys and many fears,\\n    That some will bear in mind for years;\\n    But at her pier once more she lay\\n    When night gave place to creeping day.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES\\' TALLY-HO.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    As shades of evening closed around,\\n        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,\\n        Looked out to view with staring eye\\n        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.\\n    Around the park they saw it roll,\\n    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,\\n    Now rumbling o\\'er an arching bridge,\\n    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,\\n    Now wheeling out again in view\\n    To whirl along some avenue.\\n    They hardly could restrain a shout\\n    When they observed the grand turnout.\\n    The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,\\n    The prancing horses, and the crowd\\n                    Of people perched so high in air\\n                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.\\n                    Said one: \"A rig like this we see\\n    Would suit the Brownies to a T!\\n    And I\\'m the one, here let me say,\\n    To put such pleasures in our way:\\n    I know the very place to go\\n    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.\\n    It never yet has borne a load\\n                    Of happy hearts along the road;\\n                    But, bright and new in every part\\n                    \\'Tis ready for an early start.\\n                    The horses in the stable stand\\n                    With harness ready for the hand;\\n                    If all agree, we\\'ll take a ride\\n                    For miles across the country wide.\"\\n                    Another said: \"The plan is fine;\\n                    You well deserve to head the line;\\n                    But, on the road, the reins I\\'ll draw;\\n    I know the way to \\'gee\\' and \\'haw,\\'\\n    And how to turn a corner round,\\n    And still keep wheels upon the ground.\"\\n    Another answered: \"No, my friend,\\n    We\\'ll not on one alone depend;\\n    But three or four the reins will hold,\\n                    That horses may be well controlled.\\n                    The curves are short, the hills are steep,\\n                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,\\n                    And at some places half the band\\n                    May have to take the lines in hand.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    That night, according to their plan,\\n    The Brownies to the stable ran;\\n    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,\\n    And cleared the fences in their race\\n      As lightly as the swallow flies\\n        To catch its morning meal supplies.\\n          Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,\\n            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,\\n    Across the roughest hill or rock\\n    They scampered like a frightened flock,\\n    Now o\\'er inclosures knee and knee,\\n    With equal speed they clambered free\\n    And soon with faces all aglow\\n    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;\\n    But little time they stood to stare\\n    Or smile upon the strange affair.\\n    As many hands make labor light,\\n    And active fingers win the fight,\\n    Each busy Brownie played his part,\\n    And soon \\'t was ready for the start.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    But ere they took their seats to ride\\n    By more than one the horns were tried,\\n    Each striving with tremendous strain\\n    The most enlivening sound to gain,\\n    And prove he had a special right\\n    To blow the horn throughout the night.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Though some were crowded in a seat,\\n    And some were forced to keep their feet\\n    Or sit upon another\\'s lap,\\n    And some were hanging to a strap,\\n    With merry laugh and ringing shout,\\n    And tooting horns, they drove about.\\n\\n    A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,\\n    The lively band had traveled o\\'er,\\n    Commenting on their happy lot\\n    And keeping horses on the trot,\\n    When, as they passed a stunted oak\\n    A wheel was caught, the axle broke!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Then some went out with sudden pitch,\\n    And some were tumbled in the ditch,\\n    And one jumped off to save his neck,\\n    While others still hung to the wreck.\\n    Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,\\n    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,\\n    And what began with fun and clatter\\n    Had turned to quite a serious matter.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought\\n                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.\\n                        More said, that they small wisdom showed,\\n                        Who left the root so near the road.\\n                        But while they talked about their plight\\n                        Upon them burst the morning light\\n                        With all the grandeur and the sheen\\n                          That June could lavish on the scene.\\n                          So hitching horses where they could,\\n                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.\\n                                  And lucky were the Brownies spry:\\n                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh\\n                                  That seemed to swallow them alive\\n    So quick were they to jump and dive,\\n    To safely hide from blazing day\\n    That fast had driven night away,\\n    And forced them to leave all repairs\\n    To other heads and hands than theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES ON\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTHE RACE-TRACK.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    While Brownies moved around one night\\n                    A seaside race-track came in sight.\\n                    \"\\'T is here,\" said one, \"the finest breed\\n                    Of horses often show their speed;\\n                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,\\n                    Beneath the jockeys\\' urging blows,\\n                    They sweep around the level mile\\n                    The people shouting all the while;\\n    And climbing up or crowding through\\n    To gain a better point of view,\\n    So they can see beyond a doubt\\n    How favorites are holding out.\"\\n    Another said: \"I know the place\\n    Where horses wait to-morrow\\'s race;\\n    We\\'ll strap the saddles on their back,\\n    And lead them out upon the track.\\n    Then some will act the jockey\\'s part,\\n    And some, as judges, watch the start,\\n    And drop the crimson flag to show\\n    The start is fair and all must go.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul\\n    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.\\n    They bridled them without delay,\\n        And saddles strapped in proper way.\\n        Some restless horses rearing there\\n        Would toss their holders high in air,\\n        And test the courage and the art\\n        Of those who took an active part.\\n        Said one: \"I\\'ve lurked in yonder wood,\\n          And watched the races when I could.\\n            I know how all is done with care\\n              When thus for racing they prepare;\\n                How every buckle must be tight,\\n                And every strap and stirrup right,\\n    Or jockeys would be on the ground\\n    Before they circled half way round.\"\\n    When all was ready for the show\\n    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow\\n    At climbing up to take a place\\n    And be a jockey in the race.\\n    Full half a dozen Brownies tried\\n    Upon one saddle now to ride;\\n    But some were into service pressed\\n    As judges to control the rest--\\n    To see that rules were kept complete,\\n    And then decide who won the heat.\\n    A dozen times they tried to start;\\n    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,\\n    And were prepared to take the lead\\n    Around the track at flying speed.\\n    But others were so far behind,\\n    On horses of unruly mind,\\n    The judges from the stand declare\\n    The start was anything but fair.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        So back they\\'d jog at his command,\\n        In better shape to pass the stand.\\n        Indeed it was no simple trick\\n        To ride those horses, shy and quick,\\n        And only for the mystic art\\n        That is the Brownies\\' special part,\\n    A dozen backs, at least, had found\\n    A resting-place upon the ground.\\n\\n    The rules of racing were not quite\\n    Observed in full upon that night.\\n    Around and round the track they flew,\\n    In spite of all the judge could do.\\n    The race, he tried to let them know,\\n    Had been decided long ago.\\n    But still the horses kept the track,\\n    With Brownies clinging to each back.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            Some racers of the jumping kind\\n            At times disturbed the riders\\' mind\\n            When from the track they sudden wheeled,\\n            And over fences took the field,\\n            As if they hoped in some such mode\\n            To rid themselves of half their load.\\n        But horses, howsoever smart,\\n        Are not a match for Brownie art,\\n    For still the riders stuck through all,\\n    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.\\n    Some clung to saddle, some to mane,\\n    While others tugged at bridle rein.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    So all the steeds found it would pay\\n    To let the Brownies have their way,\\n    Until a glimpse of rising sun\\n    Soon made them leave the place and run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES\\' BIRTHDAY DINNER.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    When people through the county planned\\n    To give their public dinners grand,\\n    The Brownies met at day\\'s decline\\n    To have a birthday banquet fine.\\n    \"The proper things,\" a speaker cried,\\n    \"Await us here on every side;\\n    We simply have to reach and take\\n    And choose a place to boil and bake.\\n    With meal and flour at our feet,\\n    And wells of water pure and sweet,\\n    That Brownie must be dull indeed\\n    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.\\n    We\\'ll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,\\n    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,\\n    Then slice them up the proper size\\n    To make at length those famous pies,\\n    For which the people, small and great,\\n    Are ever quick to reach a plate.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    This pleased them all; so none were slow\\n    In finding work at which to go.\\n    A stove that chance threw in their way\\n    Was put in shape without delay.\\n                    Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,\\n                    The spacious oven still was there,\\n                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide\\n                    Might bake together side by side.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n              The level top, though incomplete,\\n              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,\\n              Where stews could steam and dumplings found\\n              A fitting place to roll around.\\n    Some lengths of pipe were raised on high\\n    That made the soot and cinders fly,\\n    And caused a draught throughout the wreck\\n    That door or damper failed to check.\\n              The rogues who undertook the part,\\n              That tries the cook\\'s delightful art,\\n              Had smarting hands and faces red\\n              Before the table-cloth was spread;\\n                      But what cared they at such an hour\\n                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?\\n                      Such ills are always reckoned slight\\n                      When great successes are in sight.\\n                      There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,\\n                      Of both the \"leaf\" and \"notched\" design,\\n                      Were ranged in rows around the pan\\n                    That into heated ovens ran;\\n                    Where, in what seemed a minute\\'s space,\\n                    Another batch would take their place;\\n                    While birds, that had secured repose\\n                    Above the reach of Reynard\\'s nose,\\n                    Without the aid of wings came down\\n                    To be at midnight roasted brown.\\n                    They found some boards and benches laid\\n                    Aside by workmen at their trade,\\n                    And these upon the green were placed\\n                    By willing hands with proper haste.\\n                    Said one, who board and bench combined:\\n                    \"All art is not to cooks confined,\\n                    And some expertness we can show\\n

showed,\\n            The table waited for its load.\\n          The knives and forks and dishes white\\n        By secret methods came to light.\\n      Much space would be required to tell\\n    Just how the table looked so well;\\n    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,\\n    Must there have yielded up their store;\\n    For all the guests on every side\\n    With full equipments were

Brownies may have used the ware\\n      And failed to show the proper care.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n     A few, as waiters, passed about\\n    New dishes when the old gave out,\\n     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,\\n      Were heaped again with something rare.\\n       No member, as you may believe,\\n        Was anxious such a place to leave,\\n                Until he had a taste at least\\n                Of all the dishes in the feast.\\n                The Brownies, when they break their fast,\\n                Will eat as long as viands last,\\n                And even birds can not depend\\n                On crumbs or pickings at the end:\\n                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,\\n                And not a morsel to be seen,\\n                Ere Brownies from that table ran\\n                To shun the prying eyes of man.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES\\' HALLOW-EVE.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,\\n     When elves and goblins frisk and run,\\n       And many games and tricks are tried\\n         At every pleasant fireside,\\n        The Brownies halted to survey\\n       A village that below them lay,\\n      And wondered as they rested there\\n    To hear the laughter fill the air\\n    That from the happy children came\\n    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.\\n    Said one: \"What means this merry flow\\n    That comes so loudly from below,\\n    Uncommon pleasures must abound\\n    Where so much laughter can be found.\"\\n    Another said: \"Now, by your leave,\\n    I\\'ll tell you \\'t is All-Hallow-eve,\\n    When people meet to have their sport\\n    At curious games of every sort;\\n    I know them all from first to last,\\n    And now, before the night has passed,\\n    For some convenient place we\\'ll start\\n    Without delay to play our part.\"\\n    Two dozen mouths commenced to show\\n    Their teeth in white and even row;\\n    Two dozen voices cried with speed,\\n    \"The plan is good we\\'re all agreed.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    And in a trice four dozen feet\\n    Went down the hill with even beat.\\n    Without a long or wearying race\\n    The Brownies soon secured a place\\n    That answered well in every way\\n    For all the games they wished to play.\\n    There tubs of water could be found,\\n    By which to stoop or kneel around,\\n    And strive to bring the pennies out\\n    That on the bottom slipped about.\\n    Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,\\n    Where some would still the coin pursue,\\n    And mouth about now here and there\\n    Without a pause or breath of air\\n    Until in pride, with joyful cries,\\n    They held aloft the captured prize.\\n    More stood the tempting bait beneath,\\n    And with a hasty snap of teeth\\n    The whirling apple thought to claim\\n    And shun the while the candle\\'s flame,--\\n    But found that with such pleasure goes\\n    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    More named the oats as people do\\n    To try which hearts are false, which true,\\n    And on the griddle placed the pair\\n    To let them part or smoulder there;\\n    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,\\n    How often hearts were true as steel.\\n    Still others tried to read their fate\\n    Or fortune in a dish or plate,\\n    Learn whether they would ever wed,\\n    Or lead a single life instead;\\n    Or if their mate would be a blessing,\\n    Or prove a partner most distressing.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Then others in the open air,\\n    Of fun and frolic had their share;\\n    Played \"hide and seek,\" and \"blindman\\'s buff,\"\\n    And \"tag\" o\\'er places smooth or rough,\\n    And \"snap the whip\" and \"trip the toe,\"\\n    And games that none but Brownies know.\\n    As if their lives at stake were placed,\\n    They jumped around and dodged and raced,\\n    And tumbled headlong to the ground\\n    When feet some hard obstruction found;\\n    At times across the level mead,\\n    Some proved their special claims to speed,\\n    And as reward of merit wore\\n    A wreath of green till sport was o\\'er.\\n    The hours flew past as hours will\\n    When joys do every moment fill;\\n    The moon grew weak and said good-night,\\n    And turned her pallid face from sight;\\n    Then weakening stars began to fail,\\n    But still the Brownies kept the vale;\\n    Full many a time had hours retired\\n    Much faster than the band desired,\\n    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay\\n    Aside, because of coming day,\\n      But never yet with greater pain\\n        Did they behold the crimson stain\\n          That morning spread along the sky,\\n            And told them they must homeward fly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES\\' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The Brownies through a village bound,\\n    Paused in their run to look around,\\n    And wondered why the central square\\n    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.\\n    Said one: \"Without delay we\\'ll go\\n    To woods that stand some miles below.\\n    The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest\\n    So straight and high above the rest,\\n    We soon can choose a flag-pole there\\n    To ornament this village square.\\n    Then every one a hand will lend\\n    To trim it off from end to end,\\n    To peel it smooth and paint it white,\\n    And hoist it in the square to-night.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Then to the woods the Brownies ran\\n    At once to carry out their plan;\\n    While some ran here and there with speed\\n    For implements to serve their need,\\n    Some rambled through the forest free\\n    To find the proper kind of tree,\\n    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood\\n    To learn if it was sound and good,\\n                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,\\n                                   To mar its looks from end to end.\\n                                   When one was found that suited well,\\n                                   To work the active Brownies fell;\\n      And soon with sticks beneath their load,\\n      The band in grand procession strode;\\n        It gave them quite enough to do\\n        To safely put the project through,\\n        But when they reached the square, at last,\\n        Some ropes around the pole were passed\\n        And from the tops of maples tall\\n        A crowd began to pull and haul,\\n        While others gathered at the base\\n        Until the flag-pole stood in place.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    For Brownies seldom idle stand\\n    When there is fun or work on hand.\\n    At night when darkness wraps us round\\n    They come from secret haunts profound,\\n    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,\\n    They clamber over fence and wall;\\n    And soon on objects here and there\\n    That hold positions high in air,\\n    And most attract the human eye,\\n    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.\\n    Sometimes with feet that never tire\\n    They climb the tall cathedral spire;\\n    When all the town is still below,\\n    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,\\n    By light of moon, and stars alone,\\n    They dust the marble and the stone,\\n          And with their brushes, small and great,\\n          They paint and gild the dial-plate;\\n          And bring the figures plain in sight\\n          That all may note Time\\'s rapid flight.\\n          And accidents they often know\\n          While through the heavy works they go,\\n          Where slowly turning wheels at last\\n          In bad position hold them fast.\\n          But Brownies, notwithstanding all\\n          The hardships that may them befall,\\n          Still persevere in every case\\n          Till morning drives them from the place.\\n          And then with happy hearts they fly\\n          To hide away from human eye.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    One night the Brownies stood beside\\n    A long canal, whose silent tide\\n    Connected seaboard cities great\\n    With inland sections of the state.\\n    The laden boats, so large and strong,\\n    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;\\n    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,\\n    No mules were tugging on the shore;\\n    All work on land and water too\\n    Had been abandoned by the crew.\\n    Said one: \"We see, without a doubt,\\n    What some dispute has brought about.\\n    Perhaps a strike for greater pay,\\n    For even rates, or shorter day,\\n    Has caused the boats to loiter here\\n    With cargoes costing some one dear.\\n    These cabbages so large and round\\n    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,\\n    Upon some kitchen-stove or range\\n    To spread an odor rich and strange;\\n    Those squashes, too, should not be lost\\n    By long exposure to the frost,\\n    When they would prove so great a prize\\n    To old and young, if baked in pies.\\n    And then those pippins, ripe and fair,\\n    From some fine orchard picked with care,\\n                    Should not to rot and ruin go,\\n                    Though work is hard or wages low,\\n                    When thousands would be glad to stew\\n                    The smallest apples there in view.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Another said: \"We lack the might\\n    To set the wrongs of labor right,\\n    But by the power within us placed\\n    We\\'ll see that nothing goes to waste.\\n    So every hand must be applied\\n    That boats upon their way may glide.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Then some ran here and there with speed\\n    To find a team to suit their need.\\n    A pair of mules, that grazed about\\n    The grassy banks, were fitted out\\n                With straps and ropes without delay\\n                To start the boats upon their way;\\n                And next some straying goats were found,\\n                Where in a yard they nibbled round\\n                Destroying plants of rarest kind\\n                That owners in the town could find.\\n    Soon, taken from their rich repast,\\n    They found themselves in harness fast;\\n    Then into active service pressed\\n    They trod the tow-path with the rest.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    On deck some Brownies took their stand\\n    To man the helm, or give command,\\n    And oversee the work; while more\\n    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.\\n\\n            At times the rope would drag along\\n            And catch on snags or branches long,\\n                    And cause delays they ill could bear,\\n                    For little time they had to spare.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            With accidents they often met,\\n            And some were bruised and more were wet;\\n            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;\\n            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.\\n\\n            But what care Brownies for a bruise,\\n            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,\\n            When enterprises bold and new\\n    Must ere the dawn be carried through?\\n    If half the band were drenched, no doubt\\n    The work would still be carried out,\\n    For extra strength would then be found\\n    In those who still were safe and sound.\\n\\n    But once, when \"low bridge!\" was the shout\\n    They stood and stared or ran about\\n    Till in the water, heels o\\'er head,\\n    Some members of the band were spread.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    A few could swim, and held their own;\\n    But more went downward like a stone\\n    Until, without the plummet\\'s aid,\\n            They learned how deep canals are made.\\n            In spite of all the kicks and flings\\n            That fright at such a moment brings,\\n    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,\\n    It looked as if their end was near.\\n    The order now to stop the team\\n    Would pass along with sign and scream,\\n    And those on land would know by this\\n    That something startling was amiss;\\n    And those on board could plainly see\\n    Unless assistance there could be,\\n    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,\\n    There\\'d be some vacancies, ere long!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    By chance a net was to be had,\\n    That boatmen used for catching shad--\\n    A gill-net of the strongest kind,\\n    For heavy catches well designed;\\n    Few shad against its meshes ran\\n    But left their bones on some one\\'s pan,\\n    This bulky thing the active crew\\n    Far overboard with promptness threw.\\n    A hold at once some Brownies found,\\n    While others in its folds were bound,\\n    Until like fish in great dismay\\n    Inside the net they struggling lay.\\n    But willing hands were overhead,\\n    And quickly from the muddy bed\\n    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled\\n    The dripping net was upward hauled,\\n    With all the Brownies clinging fast,\\n    Till safe on deck they stood at last.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road\\n                    And in the stream with all its load.\\n    Then precious time would be consumed\\n    Before the trip could be resumed.\\n    Thus on they went from mile to mile,\\n    With many strange mishaps the while,\\n    But working bravely through the night\\n    Until the city came in sight.\\n\\n    Said one: \"Now, thanks to bearded goats\\n    And patient mules, the heavy boats\\n    For hours have glided on their way,\\n    And reached the waters of the bay.\\n    But see, the sun\\'s about to show\\n    His colors to the world below,\\n    And other birds than those of night\\n    Begin to take their morning flight.\\n    Our time is up; we\\'ve done our best;\\n    The ebbing tide must do the rest;\\n    Now drifting downward to their pier\\n    Let barges unassisted steer,\\n    While we make haste, with nimble feet,\\n    To find in woods a safe retreat.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.\\n\\n\\n    The Brownies once approached in glee\\n    A slumbering city by the sea.\\n    \"In yonder town,\" the leader cried,\\n    \"I hear the artist does reside\\n    Who pictures out, with patient hand,\\n    The doings of the Brownie band.\"\\n    \"I\\'d freely give,\" another said,\\n    \"The cap that now protects my head,\\n    To find the room, where, day by day,\\n    He shows us at our work or play.\"\\n    A third replied: \"Your cap retain\\n    To shield your poll from snow or rain.\\n    His studio is farther down,\\n    Within a corner-building brown.\\n    So follow me a mile or more\\n    And soon we\\'ll reach the office door.\"\\n\\n    [Illustration]\\n\\n    Then through the park, around the square,\\n    And down the broadest thoroughfare,\\n    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,\\n    And reached the building huge at last.\\n\\n    [Illustration]\\n\\n        They paused awhile to view the sight,\\n        To speak about its age and height,\\n        And read the signs, so long and wide,\\n        That met the gaze on every side.\\n                But little time was wasted there,\\n                For soon their feet had found the stair.\\n                And next the room, where oft are told\\n                Their funny actions, free and bold,\\n                Was honored by a friendly call\\n                From all the Brownies, great and small.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                Then what a gallery they found,\\n                As here and there they moved around--\\n                For now they gaze upon a scene\\n                That showed them sporting on the green;\\n                Then, hastening o\\'er the fields with speed\\n                To help some farmer in his need.\\n                Said one, \"Upon this desk, no doubt,\\n                Where now we cluster round about,\\n                Our doings have been plainly told\\n    From month to month, through heat and cold.\\n    And there\\'s the ink, I apprehend,\\n    On which our very lives depend.\\n    Be careful, moving to and fro,\\n    Lest we upset it as we go.\\n            For who can tell what tales untold\\n            That darksome liquid may unfold!\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            A telephone gave great delight\\n            To those who tried it half the night,\\n            Some asking after fresh supplies;\\n    Or if their stocks were on the rise;\\n    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;\\n    Or who desired a second term.\\n\\n    Thus messages ran to and fro\\n    With \"Who are you?\" \"Hallo!\" \"Hallo!\"\\n    And all the repetitions known\\n    To those who use the telephone.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    \"Oh, here\\'s the pen, as I opine,\"\\n    Said one, \"that\\'s written every line;\\n    Indebted to this pen are we\\n    For all our fame and history.\"\\n    \"See here,\" another said, \"I\\'ve found\\n    The pointed pencil, long and round,\\n    That pictures all our looks so wise,\\n            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;\\n            \\'Tis well it draws us all aright,\\n            Or we might bear it off to-night.\\n            But glad are we to have our name\\n            In every region known to fame,\\n            To know that children lisp our praise,\\n            And on our faces love to gaze.\"\\n    Old pistols that brave service knew\\n    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view\\n    In mimic duels on the floor,\\n    And snapped at paces three or four;\\n    While from the foils the Brownies plied,\\n    The sparks in showers scattered wide,\\n    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,\\n    In swift succession followed hard.\\n    The British and Mongolian slash\\n    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,\\n    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,\\n    Were amply tested through and through.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    They found old shields that bore the dint\\n    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,\\n    And held them up in proper pose;\\n    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,\\n    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,\\n    Until the laugh of comrades nigh\\n    Led them to look with sharper eye.\\n    A portrait now they criticize,\\n    Which every one could recognize:\\n    The features, garments, and the style,\\n    Soon brought to every face a smile.\\n    Some tried a hand at painting there,\\n    And showed their skill was something rare;\\n    While others talked and rummaged through\\n    The desk to find the stories new,\\n    That told about some late affair,\\n    Of which the world was not aware.\\n    But pleasure seemed to have the power\\n    To hasten every passing hour,\\n    And bring too soon the morning chime,\\n    However well they note the time.\\n    Now, from a chapel\\'s brazen bell,\\n    The startling hint of morning fell,\\n    And Brownies realized the need\\n    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.\\n    So down the staircase to the street\\n    They made their way with nimble feet,\\n    And ere the sun could show his face,\\n    The band had reached a hiding-place.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Another Brownie Book, by Palmer

Having also observ'd, That to know them, it would be sometimes\\nneedfull for me to consider every one in particular, or sometimes only\\nto restrain them, or comprehend many together; I thought, that to\\nconsider them the better in particular I ought to suppose them in\\nlines, for as much as I find nothing more simple, nor which I could more\\ndistinctly represent to my imagination, and to my sences; But to hold or\\ncomprehend many in one, I was oblig'd to explain them by certain Cyphers\\nthe shortest I possibly could, and that I should thereby borrow the best\\nof the Geometricall Analysis, and of Algebra, & so correct all the\\ndefects of the one by the other.\\n\\nAs in effect I dare say, That the exact observation of those few\\nprecepts I had chosen, gave me such a facility to resolve all the\\nquestions whereto these two sciences extend; That in two or three months\\nspace which I employed in the examination of them, having begun by the\\nmost simple and most generall, and every Truth which I found being a\\nrule which afterwards served me to discover others; I did not only\\ncompasse divers truths which I had formerly judged most difficult, But\\nme thought also that towards the end I could determin even in those\\nwhich I was ignorant of, by what means and how farr it was possible to\\nresolve them. Wherein perhaps I shall not appear to be very vain if you\\nconsider, That there being but one truth of every thing, who ever finds\\nit, knows as much of it as one can know; And that for example a child\\ninstructed in Arithmatick having made an addition according to his\\nrules, may be sure to have found, touching the sum he examined, all what\\nthe wit of man could finde out.\",\n",

The first point of comparison,\\ntherefore, is--How many rounds of _such_ ammunition in the minute could\\ntwenty men project by the ordinary means of artillery?--or how many in\\na volley, even if they had all the means at hand?--And the next point\\nis--what are the comparative facilities in bringing these different\\nmeans into action, where the one system requires only the transport of\\nthe ammunition--the other, not only that of the ammunition, but of the\\nmost massive ordnance, without which it is entirely useless?\\n\\nBut independent of this comparison as to quantity, there are others\\nin which the Rocket has advantages exclusively its own: there are\\nsituations where artillery cannot by any means be brought into action,\\nwhile there is no situation, no nature of ground, which is passable\\nto an infantry soldier with his musket in his hand, that is not\\nequally to be passed by the Rocketteer with _his_ arm and ammunition.\\nFor the accomplishment of any particular service, he may dispense\\nentirely with wheel carriages or even horses; there is nothing which\\nthe men themselves cannot transport and bring into action; and if any\\nbombardment were required by a _coup de main_, 1,000 men would not\\nonly convey 1,000 rounds of the heaviest Carcass Rockets, a number\\nsufficient to destroy any place within the compass of their range, but\\nwould perform that service in a few hours, having neither batteries or\\nplatforms to erect, nor mortars to convey.\\n\\nSuch are the true principles of this new system of artillery, for\\n(projecting the same ammunition) so it may be called, and the greater\\nthe scale of equipment, the greater in proportion will its powers\\nappear; thus, if an establishment were formed on the strength of a\\ncavalry regiment, if 600 mounted men were equipped on the principles of\\nthe present detachment, they would take into action, without ammunition\\nhorses or wheel carriages, 2,400 rounds of ammunition, and 200 abouches\\na féu; and if 100 ammunition horses were attached to this corps, it\\nwould further possess a reserve of nearly 2,000 rounds more: the whole\\ncapable of every movement and service practicable by any other regiment\\nof heavy cavalry; and the same proportionate power would be found to\\nattach to every other mode of equipment.\\n\\nIn addition to this view of the powers of the weapon, it is important\\nto state, that the detail of the service is most extraordinarily\\nsimple; that there are but a few points to be attended to in its\\napplication; and those such as may be most easily acquired; the\\nprincipal ones are, that care must be taken to fix the sticks very\\nfirmly to the Rocket, and in the true direction of the axis of the\\nRocket, to prevent aberration of flight.\\n\\nThat, at high angles, the frame must always be elevated for the large\\nRockets from 5° to 10° more than the elevation at which the Rocket is\\nintended to be projected, and in the small Rockets from 2½° to 5°; for,\\nas the Rocket leaves the frame before it has obtained its full force,\\nit drops a certain number of degrees in proportion to its weight at\\ngoing off.',\n",

   \"You\\'re not alone,\" another cried,\\n        \"In taking note.

     The string was nowhere to be found;\\n        The tail about a bough was wound.\\n        Some birds had torn the paper out,\\n        To line their nests, in trees about,\\n        But there beside the wreck I staid,\\n        Until I learned how kites are made.\\n        On me you safely may depend,\\n        To show the way to cut and bend.\\n        So let us now, while winds are

Perhaps some youthful angler whines\\n        About his missing fishing-lines.\\n    But let them find                   things where they will,\\n    The Brownies must                   be furnished

Before the kites, with string and tail,\\n        Were all prepared to ride the gale;\\n        And oh, the climax of their glee\\n        Was reached when kites were floating free!\\n        So quick they mounted through the air\\n        That tangling strings played mischief there,\\n    And threatened to remove from land\\n    Some valued members of the band.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The birds of night were horrified\\n    At finding kites on every side,\\n    And netted strings, that seemed to be\\n    Designed to limit action free.\\n\\n    But Brownies stood or ran about,\\n    Now winding up, now letting out;\\n    Now giving kites more tail or wing,\\n    Now wishing for a longer string;\\n    Until they saw the

Around the eaves to find their meal,\\n    And owls to hoot in forests wide,\\n    To call their owlets to their side,\\n    The Brownie Band, in full array,\\n    Through silent streets pursued their way.\\n    But as they neared a building high,\\n    Surprise was shown in every eye.\\n    They heard the strains of music sweet,\\n    And tripping of the dancers\\' feet;\\n    While o\\'er the tap of heel and toe,\\n    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,\\n    Arose the clear and ringing call\\n    Of those who had control of all.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,\\n    Then gathered closely round the place,\\n            To study out some way to win\\n            A peep or two at those within.\\n            Said one: \"In matters of this kind\\n            Opinions differ, you will find.\\n            And some might say, with sober thought,\\n            That children should not thus be taught\\n            To hop around on toe and heel\\n            So actively to fiddle\\'s squeal,\\n                For fear \\'twould turn their minds away\\n                From graver duties of the day.\"\\n                Another said: \"The dancing art\\n                Doth ease to every move impart.\\n                It gives alike to city-bred\\n                And country-born a graceful tread,\\n            And helps them bear themselves along\\n            Without offense in greatest throng.\\n    The nimble step, the springing knee,\\n    And balanced body all agree.\\n    The feet, my friends, may glide with grace\\n    As well as trudge from place to place.\\n    And in the parlor or without\\n    They best can stand or walk about\\n    Who found in early life a chance\\n    To mingle in the sprightly dance.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    The Brownies need no ladders long,\\n    No hoists, nor

the base\\n    If fancy leads them to the place.\\n    \\'Tis said the very fleecy clouds\\n    They can bestride in eager crowds,\\n    Around the world their way to find,\\n    And leave the lagging winds behind.\\n    Said one: \"We\\'ve scaled the dizzy heights\\n    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,\\n    And crossed the stream from shore to shore\\n    Where but the string-piece stretched before;\\n    And cunning Brownies, never fear,\\n    Will find some way to enter here.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    When once the Brownies\\' plans were laid,\\n    No formal, tiresome speech was made.\\n    In mystic ways, to Brownies known,\\n    They clambered up the walls of stone.\\n    They clung to this and that, like briers,\\n    They climbed the smooth electric wires;\\n    Some members lending ready aid\\n    To those who weaker nerves displayed.\\n    And in five minutes at the most,\\n    By vine, by bracket, and by post,\\n    By every scroll, and carving bold,\\n    That toes could touch or fingers hold\\n    They made their way, and gained a chance\\n    To view, unnoticed, every dance.\\n    Said one: \"How pleasant is the sight\\n    To see those children young and bright\\n    While skipping blithely to and fro,\\n    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,\\n    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,\\n    And lightly moving at command--\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        Like butterflies through balmy air\\n        When summer spreads attractions fair,\\n    And blends with every whispering breeze\\n    The drowsy hum of working bees.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Another said: \"When this is o\\'er\\n    The Brownie Band will take the floor.\\n            We\\'ll bide our time and not be slow\\n            To take possession when they go.\\n              Then up and down the spacious hall\\n              We\\'ll imitate the steps of all.\\n              We\\'ll show that not in Frenchmen\\'s bones\\n              Lies all the grace that nature owns;\\n              That others at the waltz can shine\\n              As well as Germans from the Rhine;\\n            That we some capers can enjoy\\n            As well as natives of Savoy.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            While thus they talked, the moments flew,\\n            And soon the master\\'s task was through.\\n    When children\\'s cloaks were wrapped around,\\n    And heavier shoes their feet had found\\n    They hastened home; but while they slept\\n    The Brownies in that building crept\\n    To take their turn at lively reel,\\n            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,\\n            Till all the dances people know,\\n              From Cuba\\'s palms to Russia\\'s snow\\n              Were tried, and soon in every case\\n              Were mastered with surprising grace.\\n              Imagine how they skipped about,\\n              And how they danced, with laugh and shout!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    No sooner had the Brownies run\\n    Into the hall than \\'twas begun.\\n    Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,\\n    The music in the strings awoke.\\n    The violins to others fell,\\n    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,\\n    Until the sweet and stirring air\\n    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.\\n    Like people in the spring of life,\\n    Of joys and countless blessings rife,\\n    Who yield themselves to Pleasure\\'s hand--\\n    So danced that night the Brownie Band.\\n    First one would take his place to show\\n    The special step for heel or toe,\\n    Just how to edge about with care,\\n    And help around the partner fair,\\n    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--\\n    To cause confusion and distress.\\n    Then more would play the master\\'s part,\\n    And give some lessons in the art:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        Would show the rest some figures new\\n        From Turkey, China, or Peru.\\n        Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,\\n    Then bob around, as if on springs,\\n    Until the sprightly steps would call\\n    Loud acclamations from them all.\\n    They danced in twos with skip and bound,\\n    They danced in circles, round and round;\\n    They danced in lines that coiled about\\n    As runs the serpent in and out,\\n    Some moving slow, some standing still--\\n    More cutting capers with a will.\\n    At length, by joining hand in hand,\\n    The set included all the band.\\n    A happier crowd was never seen\\n    On ball-room floor or village green.\\n    By turns they danced, by turns would go\\n    And try their skill at string and bow--\\n    They almost sawed the fiddle through,\\n    So fast the bow across it flew.\\n    And louder still the harp would ring,\\n    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.\\n    Alike they seemed a skillful band\\n    Upon the floor or music-stand.\\n    The night wore on, from hour to hour,\\n    And still they danced with vim and power;\\n    For supple-kneed and light of toe\\n    The Brownies are, as well you know,\\n    And such a thing as tiring out\\n    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.\\n    As long as darkness hung her pall\\n    In heavy folds around the hall,\\n    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,\\n    Until the very break of day.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    To dance the figures o\\'er and o\\'er,\\n    They lingered on the polished floor;\\n    No sooner was one party done\\n    Than others the position won.\\n    They chose their partners for the set,\\n    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    As night advanced, and morning gray\\n    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,\\n    The lively Brownies faster flew,\\n    Across and back, around and through;\\n    Now down the center, up the side,\\n    Then back to place with graceful glide--\\n                  Until it seemed that even day\\n                  Would hardly drive the band away.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                  At length some, more upon their guard\\n                  Against surprises, labored hard\\n    To urge their comrades from the place\\n    Before the sun would show his face.\\n    They pulled and hauled with all their might\\n    At those half crazy with delight,\\n                  Who still would struggle for a chance\\n                  To have, at least, another dance--\\n                  Some figure that was quite forgot,\\n                          Although \"the finest of the lot.\"\\n                          Another wished to linger still--\\n                          In spite of warning words--until\\n                          Each member present on the floor\\n                          Had been his partner twice or more.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes\\n                Of morn began to paint the skies,\\n                And, one by one, the stars of night\\n                Grew pale before the morning\\'s light.\\n                Alone, bright Venus, in the west,\\n                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;\\n                While from the hedge the piping note\\n                Of waking birds began to float;\\n    And crows upon the wooded hills\\n    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,\\n    When Brownies scampered from the place,\\n    And undertook the homeward race.\\n    Nor made a halt in street or square,\\n    Or verdant park, however fair;\\n    But farther from the sight of man\\n    And light of day, they quickly ran.\\n    They traveled at their highest speed,\\n    And swiftly must they go, indeed;\\n    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,\\n    The rays of light began to steal\\n    Still higher up the eastern sky,\\n    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BROWNIES\\' CANDY-PULL.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    One evening, while the Brownies sat\\n    Enjoying free and friendly chat,\\n    Some on the trees, some on the ground,\\n    And others perched on fences round--\\n    One Brownie, rising in his place,\\n    Addressed the band with beaming face.\\n    The listeners gathered with delight\\n    Around the member, bold and bright,\\n    To hear him tell of scenes he\\'d spied\\n    While roaming through the country wide.\\n    \"Last eve,\" said he, \"to shun the blast,\\n    Behind a cottage fence I passed.\\n    While there, I heard a merry rout,\\n    And as the yard was dark without,\\n    I crawled along through weeds and grass,\\n    Through melon-vines and broken glass,\\n    Until I might, unnoticed, win\\n    A glimpse of all the sport within.\\n                    At length, below the window-pane,\\n                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;\\n                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind\\n                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find\\n    The facts I can relate in full\\n    About that lively candy-pull.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    \"An hour or more, I well believe,\\n    I stood, their actions to perceive,\\n    With elbows resting on the sill,\\n    And nose against the window still.\\n    I watched them closely at their fun,\\n    And learned how everything was done.\\n    The younger members took the lead,\\n    And carried on the work with speed.\\n    With nimble feet they ran about\\n    From place to place, with laugh and shout;\\n    But older heads looked on the while,\\n    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,\\n    And gave advice in manner kind\\n    To guide the inexperienced mind.\\n    They placed the sugar in a pot,\\n    And stirred it round till boiling hot;\\n    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,\\n    And stretched it out in shining bands,\\n    Until it reached across the floor,\\n    From mantel-piece to kitchen door.\\n\\n    \"These eyes of mine for many a night\\n    Have not beheld a finer sight.\\n    To pull the candy was the part\\n    Of some who seemed to know the art.\\n    The moon had slipped behind the hill,\\n    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;\\n    But still, with nose against the pane,\\n    I kept my place through wind and rain.\\n    There, perched upon the shaky pile,\\n    With bated breath I gazed the while.\\n    I watched them with the sharpest sight\\n    That I might tell the tale aright;\\n    For all the active youngsters there\\n    Appeared to have of work their share.\\n    Some put fresh sugar in the pot,\\n    Some kept the fire blazing hot,\\n    And worked away as best they could\\n    To keep the stove well filled with wood.\\n    Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,\\n    At moving here and there at will,\\n    Would have to \\'lively\\' be and \\'tear\\n    Around\\' to beat those children there!\\n    Some cut it up, more passed it round,\\n    While others ate it by the pound!\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    At this, a murmur of surprise\\n    On every side began to rise;\\n    Then smiles o\\'er every visage flitted,\\n    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,\\n    That told what train of thought had sped\\n    At once through every Brownie\\'s head--\\n    A thought of pleasure near at hand\\n    That well would suit the cunning band.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            The Brownies act without delay\\n            When new ideas cross their way,\\n            And soon one raised a finger small\\n            And close attention gained from all.\\n            They crowded near with anxious glance\\n            To learn what scheme he could advance--\\n    What methods mention or employ\\n    To bring about the promised joy.\\n    Said he: \"A vacant house is near.\\n    The owner leaves it every year\\n    For several months, and pleasure seeks\\n    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.\\n    The range is there against the wall,\\n            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,\\n            While cans of syrup may be found\\n            In every grocer\\'s store around.\\n            The Brownie must be dull and tame,\\n            And scarce deserves to bear the name,\\n            Who will not join with heart and hand\\n            To carry out a scheme so grand.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n    Another cried: \"When to his bed\\n    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,\\n    Again we\\'ll muster in full force\\n    And to that building turn our course.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n            Next eve they gained the street at last\\n            That through the silent city passed;\\n            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised\\n            And on the vacant mansion gazed.\\n    In vain the miser hides his store,\\n    In vain the merchant bars his door,\\n    In vain the locksmith changes keys--\\n    The Brownies enter where they please.\\n    Through iron doors, through gates of brass,\\n    And walls of stone they safely pass,\\n    And smile to think how soon they can\\n    Upset the studied schemes of man.\\n    Within that house, without delay,\\n    Behind the guide they worked their way,\\n    More happy far and full of glee\\n    Than was the owner, out at sea.\\n    The whale, the shark, or fish that flies\\n    Had less attraction for his eyes\\n    Than had the shining candy-balls\\n    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.\\n    Soon coal
