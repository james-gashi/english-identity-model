# english-identity-model
A model that can identify the date in which text was written based on the style of the text.

## Problem Statement
Language is dynamic, evolving over time with shifts in vocabulary, syntax, and style. These changes are influenced by cultural, social, and historical factors, making the study of linguistic evolution an intriguing area for research. Understanding when a piece of text was likely written can provide valuable insights into literary trends, historical contexts, and cultural analysis.  Our project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of estimating the date range of an English text based solely on its linguistic features. By analyzing stylistic and linguistic patterns, such as vocabulary trends, morphosyntax, and phrase frequencies, our model will learn to associate textual characteristics with specific historical periods, ultimately aiming to classify a given text/excerpt with a date range.
