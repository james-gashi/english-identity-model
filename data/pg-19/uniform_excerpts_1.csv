"""Some very remarkable discoveries
must have come to light to influence the judgment of two such men as
yourselves."" ""You are right,"" rejoined Mr. Byrd. ""In fact, I should not be surprised

"Every missionary to the islands can tell of ""devil dances"" that
take place in secluded groves, and in which, to his great disgust, his
converts often take part. It takes time to turn the savage from his old
beliefs. Although the South Seas constitute the last fortress of
romance, and a mention of the coral atolls immediately conjures up a
vision of palms and rice-white beaches, the sensitive person senses the
dark and bloody past when the wizard men were the rulers, and death
stalked in the palm groves. J.F.D.",1900-2000,10862
"As it
was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the ground, giving so
little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he could do when he
found himself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his
hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don Quixote when he saw
all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the face
of the fallen squire, exclaimed:

""By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and
plucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off
designedly.""",1600-1700,5913
"I was a joke turned upside down. After they had examined every nook and cranny of the place and had
talked themselves hoarse with delight I called them all up on the
front piazza for the purpose of putting out their lights with my
ghost story. I figured on driving them all back to the depot with about four
paragraphs of creepy talk, so when I had them huddled I began in a
hoarse whisper to raise their hair. I told them that no doubt they had noticed the worried expression
on my face and explained that it was due chiefly to the fact that I
had learned quite by accident that this beautiful place was haunted. Tacks grew so excited that he dropped a garden spade off the piazza
and into a hot house below, breaking seven panes of glass, but the
others only smiled indulgently and I went on.",1900-2000,12609
"""God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,"" answered the
bachelor. ""In that case,"" said Don Quixote, ""the Lord has relieved me of the task
of avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him
having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug
one's shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I would
have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by
name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs
and redressing injuries."" ""I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,"" said the bachelor,
""for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken leg
that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and
the injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in
such a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and the height of
misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures."" ""Things do not all happen in the same way,"" answered Don Quixote; ""it all
came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by night,
dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered with
mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the
other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and
I should have attacked you even had I known positively that you were the
very devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be."" ""As my fate has so willed it,"" said the bachelor, ""I entreat you, sir

"Back at the house Uncle Casper was sweeping the broad, marble-laid

his broken voice, did sing three parts; their names were Blaewl and

me how the business of the Parliament is wholly laid aside, it being
overruled now, that they shall not meet, but must be prorogued, upon this
argument chiefly, that all the differences between the two Houses, and
things on foot, that were matters of difference and discontent, may be
laid aside, and must begin again, if ever the House shall have a mind to
pursue them. They must begin all anew. Here he set me down, and I to my
cozen Turner, and stayed and talked a little; and so took my wife, and

"This stupendous war-engine was found
rolling helpless in the Irish Sea, her after compartments flooded by
a great hole made either by a drifting mine or, what is more likely
considering its position, by a torpedo from a German submarine. The
White Star liner _Olympic_, which had been summoned by wireless,
took the disabled warship in tow for several hours, after which the
_Audacious_ was cast off and abandoned. A photograph taken by one of

idly in the air. The little ruby eyes in the back of the dogcart's lamps
twinkling ahead seemed to inspire their driver with reckless rivalry. When they arrived at the temple the battle had reached its climax. The

"When learning and books had been extinguished, even the
mechanical arts would have fallen considerably to decay; and it is easily
imagined, that fable or tradition might ascribe to them a much later
origin than the true one. This vulgar argument, therefore, against the
eternity of the world, seems a little precarious. But here appears to be the foundation of a better argument. LUCULLUS was

delights; and finding withal not above twenty pieces left, he mounts his
Horse with an intention homewards but by the way, having some business,
(as a Wench to see or so) at _Malborough_ on the _Downs_, he was met
with, and robb’d, and with a cut or two (for he resisted) he made a
shift to get to the Town. He had behaved himself so loudly ill, that the
report came thither, and those that would in his Fathers life time have
trusted him with 500_l._ would not now trust him with so many farthings;
so that he was forc’d to sell his Horse, and go home on foot. His Wife in the mean time had not been idle in her expences, rioting in
that shameful manner, that the whole Town cryed out shame on her: those
deserved reproaches they daily threw upon her, made her resolve to lay
hold on the opportunity of her Husbands absence and secure what she
could to her own peculiar use, and quit the Town; to that intent she
consulted with her chiefest favourite, (and by the way take notice there
is no Whore so notoriously common, but she keeps one whom she loves

strip her sometimes when his Pimp-ship is in the humour, and will

so much wickedness of all sorts. Enquiring how it come to pass that so
many ships miscarried this year, he tells me that he enquired; and the
pilots do say, that they dare not do nor go but as the Captains will have
them; and if they offer to do otherwise, the Captains swear they will run
them through. He says that he heard Captain Digby (my Lord of Bristoll's

hours have been diminishing. Recently a law has been put into effect,
forbidding any one’s working more than two hours a day. This latter law
has been found to be an actual necessity, from an economic point of

"The hospital was afterward built with large stone pillars,
but, as the number of the sick constantly increased, and as there
was not room enough for them in that house, they erected another
building, very large and handsome, which was finished in 1625; and
both are still used. Since at some times they cannot accommodate the
sick because of their number, another one is now being built, still
larger and finer. The Lord always supplies it with great abundance,
as a house that continually furnishes Him people for heaven--those
who, if they had died out of the hospital, would necessarily have
died in their unbelief, and would have gone to people hell. As a result of the continued preaching to the Chinese, the number
of them converted and baptized increased from year to year. Since
after this they were not permitted to return to their own country,
they married and settled down in this one, so that the population of
Christians in Baybay belonging to this nation was greatly increased.",1600-1700,39054

"48 of the said act, will shew that the parliament were not ignorant,
that the dividends would become due on the 5th of July, but have
proceeded on the consideration of it's being due on that day. In this
clause, they say, that no _declaration_, &c. shall be after the 10th of
July. Now when they had in contemplation the _making_ of a dividend,
they mentioned the 24th of June, a time preceding the 5th of July, in
order to prevent it; when they had in contemplation the _declaring_ of a
dividend, they say the 10th of July subsequent to the 5th, to
distinguish between the terms _making_ and _declaring_, which have been
so often confounded. It must appear highly improbable to every impartial mind, that the
legislature should enact a law, to regulate the making of dividends,
without knowing the time, when they are made payable; or if they were
ignorant, that they would not enquire, when the directors attended to
answer all enquiries, and were actually examined from day to day, while
the bill was framing; and very few will be hardy enough to affirm, that
if the parliament were aware, that the dividends would be due the 5th
of July, such a blunder could creep into the act of parliament. The most
natural construction, upon reading the said act, is, that the 24th of
June was not inserted by mistake, but by design, and that the
legislature plainly intended, in the restraining clauses, that the India
company should make no dividend at all from Christmas last, which was
before the encrease of the dividend, to the beginning of the next

apiary, it usually spreads, unless speedily and energetically checked,
until all of the colonies in the neighborhood are ruined and even
exterminated. The most apparent symptoms are the turning black of
larvæ in open cells, many sealed cells with sunken caps, frequently

Sheriffes, should fail to do it. He tells me also, how, upon occasion of
some 'prentices being put in the pillory to-day for beating of their
masters, or some such like thing, in Cheapside, a company of 'prentices
came and rescued them, and pulled down the pillory; and they being set up
again, did the like again. So that the Lord Mayor and Major Generall
Browne was fain to come and stay there, to keep the peace; and drums, all
up and down the city, was beat to raise the trained bands, for to quiett
the towne, and by and by, going out with my uncle and aunt Wight by coach
with my wife through Cheapside (the rest of the company after much content
and mirth being broke up), we saw a trained band stand in Cheapside upon
their guard. We went, much against my uncle's will, as far almost as Hyde
Park, he and my aunt falling out all the way about it, which vexed me, but
by this I understand my uncle more than ever I did, for he was mighty soon

never any that knew which way to lead an army by land, or to conduct
ships by sea, anything near the said country. Orellana, of whom the
river of Amazons taketh name, was the first, and Don Antonio de Berreo,
whom we displanted, the last: and I doubt much whether he himself or
any of his yet know the best way into the said empire. It can therefore
hardly be regained, if any strength be formerly set down, but in one

war book in all history, Empey tells the new soldiers

  There serpents hiss, there seven-mouthed Hydras yell,
  Chimera there spues fire and brimstone out,
  And Polyphemus blind supporteth hell,
  Besides ten thousand monsters therein dwells
  Misshaped, unlike themselves, and like naught else. VI
  About their princes each took his wonted seat
  On thrones red-hot, ybuilt of burning brass,
  Pluto in middest heaved his trident great,
  Of rusty iron huge that forged was,
  The rocks on which the salt sea billows beat,
  And Atlas' tops, the clouds in height that pass,
  Compared to his huge person mole-hills be,
  So his rough front, his horns so lifted he. VII
  The tyrant proud frowned from his lofty cell,
  And with his looks made all his monsters tremble,
  His eyes, that full of rage and venom swell,
  Two beacons seem, that men to arms assemble,
  His feltered locks, that on his bosom fell,
  On rugged mountains briars and thorns resemble,
  His yawning mouth, that foamed clotted blood,
  Gaped like a whirlpool wide in Stygian flood. VIII
  And as Mount Etna vomits sulphur out,
  With cliffs of burning crags, and fire and smoke,
  So from his mouth flew kindled coals about,
  Hot sparks and smells that man and beast would choke,
  The gnarring porter durst not whine for doubt;
  Still were the Furies, while their sovereign spoke,
  And swift Cocytus stayed his murmur shrill,
  While thus the murderer thundered out his will:

Marseilles _Sept._ 15. 1720. Sir,

I Arriv'd here the 8_th_, and enter'd the Gate of _Aix_ which leads to the
_Cours_, which has always been esteem'd one of the most pleasant
Prospects in the Kingdom, but that Day was a very dismal Spectacle to me;
all that great Place, both on the Right and Left, was fill'd with Dead,
Sick, and Dying Persons. The Carts were continually employ'd in going and
returning to carry away the Dead Carcasses, of which there were that Day
above four Thousand. The Town was without Bread, without Wine, without
Meat, without Medicines, and in general, without any Succours.",1700-1800,31807
"But no survey of the connection of America with the Jew
is adequate without at least a reminder of how America championed the
rights of her Jewish citizens in Switzerland and Russia, and of how
she intervened in behalf of persecuted Jews in Damascus and in
Morocco, in Rumania and in Russia. When the history of the emancipation of the Jews is written, a place
of honor surely will be accorded to the help rendered by America,
through some of her foremost and most humane statesmen, from Theodore
Fay to John Hay, and through the energy and self-sacrifice of her
Jewish citizens. Nor would our survey be sufficient without a reference to the
patriotism of the American Jew. If the patriotism of the Jew has been
proved in every country, nowhere has it been more ardent and ready
than here.",1700-1800,35695

Guesclin must have had, large, broad, hairy; hands that once had clasped
the sword never, like Joan of Arc, to relinquish it until the royal
standard floated in the cathedral of Rheims; hands that were often
bloody from the thorns and furze of the Bocage; hands which had pulled
an oar in the Marais to surprise the Blues, or in the offing to signal
Georges; the hands of a guerilla, a cannoneer, a common solder, a

"The forty kapijís entered trembling and the Páshá having asked, where

disarmed and bound by his guards and soldiers. The Segbán and Sárija
called for the executioners and were going to cut off their heads,
when the principal men of the town kissed the earth before the Páshá,
and begged the lives of these kapijí-báshís, who were, they said,
only servants executing their master’s commands and therefore should
be spared. The Páshá yielding to their prayers set them at liberty,
instead of thrashing them to death as he ought to have done. Being
liberated they went to the Mehkemeh, called the Sanjak Beg, read the
firmán and demanded in consequence that the troops should be driven

"Use Fasting and severe
Abstinence, which are the proper Abscissions of the instruments and
temptations of lust. And to this is reducible a restraint from all morose
delectation, and looser banquetting: You must not desire to be fed at
_Vitellius_ his board; you must not desire _Nero's_ effeminate baths, nor
_Tiberius_ his naked Pictures to incite your lust; you must not hunt all
grounds, draw all seas, search every {20} brook and bush, or dispeople the
four Elements to please your wanton lusts, and try experiments upon your
judicious palates; but as you must abstain from [21]things _unlawful_, so
also from _lawful_ too: You must not onely take care you transcend not the
_Bounds_ of _Temperance and Moderation_, but you must sometimes abridge
your selves of your necessary repast; assuring your selves, _That the more
_[22]_you deny your selves, the more you shall receive from God_. 'Tis
storied of _Richard Nevil_ Earl of _Warwick_, (stiled also _Make-King_,)
that in the great Battel at _Ferrybrigg_ between _Henry_ the Sixth and
_Edward_ the Fourth, when he perceived his side almost worsted by _Henry_
the Sixth, he slew his Horse with his own Sword, and then uttered these
Heroick expressions, _Let all that will fight stay with me_; and then
(according to the Ceremony of those times) kissing the Cross upon his
Sword, he fought with singular courage and prowess: So in the conflict
between our Lusts and us, let us kill and mortifie our Bodies, which (in
the language of _Socrates_) are our Soul's Horses, and then excite every
Faculty {21} of our Souls with these words, _Let all that will fight stay
with me_; and when we have done thus, let us kiss and take up our Cross,
and fight stoutly under Christ the Captain of our Salvation against our
Lusts; it being impossible to keep the Spirit pure, whilest 'tis
overburdened with too much Flesh, and exposed to all entertainments of
Enemies by fomentations and pamperings; remembring the divine counsel of
the [23]Philosopher, _That we must not take care for the Body simply as the
Body, but as subservient to the Soul._ And that you may be the better
induced to do this, remember (as the fore-cited Author [24]has well said),
_That your Soul is your self, but your Body yours; for 'tis the Soul which
uses, but that which is used by it is the Body_: And by this separation of
the Soul from the Body, you will preserve your nature from confusion, nor
think that things [Greek: ta entos] which are without concern you, nor
contend for those as for your self, and so consequently avoid too much care
of your body; not resembling those, that, so that Sumpter-horse the Body be

made use of, it is incumbent on the promulgators to do it in the most
public and perspicuous manner; not like Caligula, who (according to
Dio Cassius) wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung them
up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare the people. There is still a more unreasonable method than this, which is called
making of laws _ex post facto_; when _after_ an action is committed,
the legislator then for the first time declares it to have been a
crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it;
here it is impossible that the party could foresee that an action,
innocent when it was done, should be afterwards converted to guilt by
a subsequent law; he had therefore no cause to abstain from it; and
all punishment for not abstaining must of consequence be cruel and
unjust[e]. All laws should be therefore made to commence _in futuro_,
and be notified before their commencement; which is implied in the
term ""_prescribed_.""",1700-1800,30802

"Between that period and the
reign of the second Stewart, King Robert III, the castle had already
been re-erected and re-destroyed more than once. Its occupation by the
English seemed the chief thing dreaded by the Scots, and it was again
and again by English hands that the fortifications were restored--such a
stronghold and point of defence being evidently of the first importance
to invaders, while much less valuable as a means of defence. In the year
1385 the walls must have encircled a large area upon the summit of the
rock, the _enceinte_ probably widening, as the arts of architecture and
fortification progressed, from the strong and grim eyrie on the edge of
the precipice to the wide and noble enclosure, with room for a palace as
well as a fortress, into which the great castles of England were
growing. The last erection of these often-cast-down walls was made by
Edward III on his raid into Scotland, and probably the royal founder of
Windsor Castle had given to the enclosure an amplitude unknown before. The Scots king most likely had neither the money nor the habits which
made a great royal residence desirable, especially in a spot so easily
isolated and so open to attack; but he gave a charter to his burghers of
Edinburgh authorising them to build houses within the castle walls, and
to pass in and out freely without toll or due--a curious privilege,
which must have made the castle a sort of _imperium in imperio_, a town
within a town.",1800-1900,25701

"A man in misfortune, either in sickness or in
circumstances, will learn philosophy from the pipe, and count upon the
latter, at least, as his own: in this case, from both tobacco and snuff,
he borrows an independent vigour, and a cheerfulness that shines even in
the sadness of his heart. The impregnative spirit of tobacco will wind its
way to the most secret recesses of the brain, and impart to the
imagination a soft and gentle glow of heat, equally remote from the
dullness of fervor, and the madness of intoxication; for to these two
extremes, without the moderative medium of the pipe, an author's fancy
will alternately expand itself. To the man of letters, therefore, the pipe

bend of the Seine. It was soon after his return from captivity which
followed the disastrous crusade that Richard commenced to show Philippe
Auguste that he was determined to hold his French possessions with his
whole strength. Philippe had warned John when the news of the release of
the lion-hearted king from captivity had become known, that ""the devil was
unchained,"" and the building of this castle showed that Richard was making
the most of his opportunities. The French king was, with some
justification, furious with his neighbour, for Richard had recently given
his word not to fortify this place, and some fierce fighting would have
ensued on top of the threats which the monarchs exchanged, but for the

"After two years' study
in any regular course a student may present himself for an
examination for a degree and is then eligible for a diploma in
law, medicine, engineering and other sciences. The slipshod systems pursued at these institutions have been
severely criticised by scientific educators, but they seem to
answer the purpose for which they are intended. It is often asserted
that the colleges and universities in India do not cultivate a
genuine desire for learning; that the education they furnish is
entirely superficial, and that it is obtained not for its own
sake, but because it is a necessary qualification for a government
appointment or a professional career. It is asserted that no
graduate of any of these institutions has ever distinguished
himself for scholarship or in science, that no native of India
educated in them has ever produced any original work of merit,
and that no problem of political or material importance has ever
been solved by a citizen of this empire. In 1902 Lord Curzon, who
has taken a deep interest in this subject and is an enthusiastic

the conduct and efficiency of the universities of India.",1900-2000,11212

  _Die_ is the middle of the Pedestals, _viz._ that which is

Taylor (3,394). The elaborately bound Greek Septuagint (272) and Greek

will (the only books there mentioned), calling them ""the Gift of my late

any other fine bindings, the other books seem to have been bought for

"Should then we, such feeble imitations, belittle manual
labor, even though it falls to our lot as missionaries? Any one going to
the mission field should not, if he is to be successful, decide in his
own mind that he is going to do certain things, he should be willing to
do whatever the Lord gives him to do, of spiritual, intellectual, or
physical labors. There are so many sides to missionary work, and who can tell which will
result in the greatest good? To preach Christ and lift Him up that
others may see and accept Him is undoubtedly the central thought of the
Great Commission. The ways of exalting Him, however, are so many and so
various.",1900-2000,37728
"5, 3, forbids bishops to be lords, and to rule over the
churches. It is not our design now to wrest the government from the
bishops, but this one thing is asked, namely, that they allow the Gospel
to be purely taught, and that they relax some few observances which
cannot be kept without sin. But if they make no concession, it is for
them to see how they shall give account to God for furnishing, by their
obstinacy, a cause for schism. CONCLUSION.",1483-1600,275
"In February following a grant was made by the King of all the goods
and chattels forfeited by Sir Walter's conviction to the trustees of
his appointing for the benefit of his creditors, lady and children. After 12 years confinement in the Tower, in March 1615 he was released
out of it, by the interposition of the favourite Buckingham; but
before he quitted that place he saw the earl of Somerset committed
there for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and afterwards condemned,
which occasioned Sir Walter to compare his own case with that of the
earl's, and to remark, 'That the whole History of the World had not
the like precedent of a King's prisoner to purchase freedom, and his
bosom favourite 'to have the halter, but in scripture, in the case
of Mordecai and Haman;' on hearing which, the King is said to have
replied, that Raleigh might die in that deceit, which afterwards
proved true, for the King pardoned the infamous Somerset, a murderer,
and executed Raleigh, a brave and an honest man, equally to the
astonishment of the world. Sir Walter being now at large, had the
means of prosecuting his old scheme of settling Guiana, which he
had so much at heart, that even during his imprisonment, he held a
constant correspondence with that country, sending thither every year,
or every second year, a ship, to keep the Indians in hopes of being
relieved from the tyranny of the Spaniards, who had again encroached
upon them, and massacred many, both of the inhabitants and of
Raleigh's men. In these ships were brought several natives of the
country, with whom he conversed in the Tower, and obtained all
possible informations concerning it. Upon such informations he offered
his scheme for prosecuting his discovery to the court before he
undertook it in person: nor were there any doubts either as to the
improbability of the design, or its unlawfulness, notwithstanding the
peace made with Spain, otherwise the King would not have made such
grants, as he did, even at that time, which shews that he was then
convinced, that Sir Walter had in his first voyage discovered and
taken possession of that country for the crown of England, and
consequently that his subjects were justly intitled to any benefits
that might arise from its discovery, without the least respect to the
pretensions of the Spaniards: Besides, when Sir Walter first moved the
court upon this subject, the Spanish match was not thought of, and the
King's necessities being then very pressing, he may be presumed to
have conceived great hopes from that discovery, though he might
afterwards change his opinion, when he grew so unreasonably fond of
that match.",1700-1800,10598
"She that was in the
Country with us, and who you know is an intimate Friend of ours,
happen'd to be very well acquainted with him; and when we came home, she
told me that his Name was _Orontes_; that he was a Gentleman who had but
a small Fortune; but to repair it, he was Marry'd to a rich Widow above
Threescore and ten; that tho' she was very ill Natur'd, he was the best
Husband in the World to her, but he would take his pleasure abroad
sometimes, and she was extreamly Jealous. He came to visit this Lady,
and entreated her to carry him to see me; for he said he was sensible of
the Affront he had given me the first time he saw me, and that he was
very desirous of some Occasion to serve me; and he thought himself
obliged to tell me so, and to seek all Opportunities of doing it. She
consented to it; and he came often to see us, and was very obliging to
us.",1700-1800,37218

"Since our adversaries have been admonished
of these things, they are now unlearning them, and do not preach these
unprofitable works as heretofore. Besides, they begin to mention faith,
of which there was heretofore marvelous silence. They teach that we are
justified not by works only, but they conjoin faith and works, and
say that we are justified by faith and works. This doctrine is more
tolerable than the former one, and can afford more consolation than
their old doctrine.",1483-1600,275
"It was agreed that I should serve as an
apprentice to the age of twenty-one, and should receive journeyman's
wages only during the last year. In a very short time I made great proficiency in this business, and
became very serviceable to my brother. I had now an opportunity of
procuring better books. The acquaintance I necessarily formed with
booksellers' apprentices, enabled me to borrow a volume now and then,
which I never failed to return punctually and without injury.",1700-1800,48136

inquiry, according to the several frames and compositions of their
understanding they light upon different conceits, and so all opinions
and doubts are beaten over, and then men having made a taste of all
wax weary of variety, and so reject the worst and hold themselves to
the best, either some one if it be eminent, or some two or three if
they be in some equality, which afterwards are received and carried

"""Cynthia's Revels,"" the second ""comical satire,"" was acted in 1600,
and, as a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible
than ""Every Man Out of His Humour."" Here personal satire seems to
have absorbed everything, and while much of the caricature is
admirable, especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly
satirical dialogue, the central idea of a fountain of self-love is
not very well carried out, and the persons revert at times to
abstractions, the action to allegory. It adds to our wonder that
this difficult drama should have been acted by the Children of
Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom
Jonson read Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to
make plays. Another of these precocious little actors was
Salathiel Pavy, who died before he was thirteen, already famed for
taking the parts of old men.",1483-1600,3695

waters flow towards the sea of China; the Gulph of Bengal, the Gulph of
Cambay, and the Lake Aral; in America, the province of Quito; whose
rivers run into the North and South Seas, and the Gulph of Mexico. In the old continent there are about 430 rivers, which fall directly
into the ocean, or into the Mediterranean and Black Seas; but in the new
continent not more than 145 rivers are known, which fall directly into
the sea: in this number I have comprehended only the great rivers, like
the Somme in Picardy. All these rivers carry to the sea a great quantity of mineral and saline
particles, which they have washed from the different soils through
which they have passed. The particles of salt, which are easily
dissolved, are conveyed to the sea by the water. Some philosophers, and
among the rest Halley, have pretended that the saltness of the sea
proceeded only from the salts of the earth, which the rivers transport
therein.",1700-1800,44792

worthy gentleman, and I was much obliged to him for his good opinion;
but the affections were involuntary, and mine, in particular, had as
yet made no concessions in his favour. She shook her head with an air of
distrust that made me tremble; and observed, that if my affections were
free, they would submit to the decision of prudence, especially when
enforced by the authority of those who had a right to direct my conduct. This remark implied a design to interest my uncle or my aunt, perhaps my

know not what remains of marble portico or colonnade, I peered down
through the trails of budding vines into a hollow where some fragments
of old masonry project still from the earth, and after much gazing
perceived that the sides of the hollow rise in tiers, one bank above
another, to the height of seventeen rows. So that here, on this now

to shew themselves, and to bestow some few shot upon us, but presently
withdrew themselves. And in their running thus away, the Sergeant-Major

"MY LORD:--The short journey of Count von Haugwitz to Vienna, and the long
stay of our Imperial Grand Marshal, Duroc, at Berlin, had already caused
here many speculations, not quite corresponding with the views and,
perhaps, interests of our Court, when our violation of the Prussian
territory made our courtiers exclaim: ""This act proves that the Emperor
of the French is in a situation to bid defiance to all the world, and,
therefore, no longer courts the neutrality of a Prince whose power is
merely artificial; who has indemnities to restore, but no delicacy, no
regard to claims."" Such was the language of those very men who, a month
before, declared ""that His Prussian Majesty held the balance of peace or
war in his hands; that he was in a position in which no Prussian Monarch
ever was before; that while his neutrality preserved the tranquillity of
the North of Germany, the South of Europe would soon be indebted to his
powerful mediation for the return of peace."" The real cause of this alteration in our courtiers' political jargon has
not yet been known; but I think it may easily be discovered without any
official publication. Bonaparte had the adroitness to cajole the Cabinet
of Berlin into his interest, in the first month of his consulate,
notwithstanding his own critical situation, as well as the critical
situation of France; and he has ever since taken care both to attach it
to his triumphal car and to inculpate it indirectly in his outrages and
violations. Convinced, as he thought, of the selfishness which guided
all its resolutions, all his attacks and invasions against the law of
nations, or independence of States, were either preceded or followed with
some offers of aggrandizement, of indemnity, of subsidy, or of alliance.",1800-1900,3898
"Though all are
agreed, that intemperance is the offspring of gluttony, and sober
living of abstemiousness; the former, nevertheless, is considered
a virtue and a mark of distinction, and the latter, as dishonourable
and the badge of avarice. Such mistaken notions are entirely
owing to the power of custom, established by our senses and
irregular appetites; these have blinded and besotted men to such
a degree, that, leaving the paths of virtue, they have followed
those of vice, which lead them before their time to an old age,
burthened with strange and mortal infirmities, so as to render
them quite decrepid before forty, contrary to the effects of
sobriety, which, before it was banished by this destructive
intemperance, used to keep men sound and hearty to the age of
eighty and upwards. O wretched and unhappy Italy!",1600-1700,30660
"This assumption implies that a work of art is
an entity complete in itself; it makes possible the argument that
art conveys artistic, not moral knowledge. Cooper, by stressing
sensibility as an effect of taste, suggests the Wordsworthian notion
that the poet is more sensitive than other people. Armstrong, in addition to his hostility to formal criticism and his
confidence in the natural man, reveals three other tendencies which
later eighteenth-century critics elaborated. Like Edward Young in his
_Conjectures on Original Composition_, 1759, Armstrong opposes slavish
imitation of ancient models and declares that the writer should ""catch
their graces without affecting it [them]"" so that his ""own original
characteristical manner will still distinguish itself. ""[3] Armstrong
emphasizes exquisiteness of perception as the basis for taste: the
more exquisite the mind, the more is it able to discriminate among
the various degrees of the beautiful and the deformed.",1700-1800,13464

exigency can give one power a right over what belongs to another no way
involved in the war. The case too is equally clear that no emergency
can justify any one in taking and applying to his own use what the
owner stands in equal need of himself. But even where the emergency can
be plainly proved, nothing can justify us in taking or applying the
property of another to our use, beyond the IMMEDIATE DEMANDS OF THAT
emergency. Where the CUSTODY of a thing, by securing it, is sufficient

abolish all the evils in this world by statute or by the enforcement of
statutes, nor can we prevent the inexorable law of nature which decrees
that suffering shall follow vice, and all the evil passions and folly of
mankind. Law cannot give to depravity the rewards of virtue, to indolence
the rewards of industry, to indifference the rewards of ambition, or to
ignorance the rewards of learning. The utmost that government can do is
measurably to protect men, not against the wrong they do themselves but
against wrong done by others and to promote the long, slow process of
educating mind and character to a better knowledge and nobler standards of
life and conduct. We know all this, but when we see how much misery there
is in the world and instinctively cry out against it, and when we see some
things that government may do to mitigate it, we are apt to forget how
little after all it is possible for any government to do, and to hold the
particular government of the time and place to a standard of responsibility
which no government can possibly meet.",1900-2000,10485

"The Moral of the Fable is only this, that it is impossible for any
Force to oppose the Omnipotent. Not to dispute whether the Ancients were of
Opinion, that at the Creation of the World all the Animals were of a
gigantic Size, or what might be their Sentiments about that Matter; it is
certain that there has been an Opinion among Men, in all Ages, that the
Time in which they themselves lived, produced Men of less Stature than
those who lived some Time before them. This is a Persuasion which the Poets
all encouraged, as it suited their Purpose; nothing being so great an
Enchantment, to the Mind of a poetical Reader, as to be struck with the
Marvellous. When Virgil makes Turnus throw a large Stone at Aeneas, he tells us, that
it was such a Stone as twelve Men of his degenerate Age could scarce have
carried upon their Shoulders. _Nec plura effatus, saxum circumspicit ingens:_
  _Saxum antiquum ingens, campo quod forte jacebat,_
  _Limes agro positus litem ut discerneret arvis._
  _Vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent,_
  _Qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus._

A Person who reads this Passage, and really believes that Men were larger
in Aeneas' Time than in Virgil's, reasons thus with himself: ""The Works of
Nature degenerate: Those who lived in Aeneas's Time, were larger than those
who lived in Virgil's; and those who lived in the Time of Virgil, were
larger than those who live now.""",1700-1800,41274

named as being shown to Queen Elizabeth, which was clearly a flagrant
piece of fraud practised by Kelly, a common adventurer, and from his
youth remarkable only for his indifferent character. An easily performed trick was effected by means of nails, or other
light articles, made half of gold and half iron, but disguised, so as to
appear to be of one metal and colour. Sometimes these knaves employed
crucibles, having an interior false bottom, below which a small quantity
of gold was placed, which, being reproduced, as was pretended from base
materials, was offered as an example of success. Or, by having the gold
in a hollow rod, stopped at one end with wax, used to stir up the
materials, the gold would naturally enough appear in the crucible. Or,
their materials being conveyed into charcoal, a similar result would be
obtained on heating the crucible in a furnace.",1600-1700,43841

"""Now many maintained that this leaning to Christianity arose from a
supernatural source, and was produced by the baptismal sign, which had
been impressed upon him by a Christian, whilst he was in the cradle. When later this report had been carefully investigated, it was
certified that a preceptor, Stephen Hiller, was once sent to Lazarus
Abeles to obtain payment of a debt, that he there found a child lying
alone in the cradle, and had, from deep impulse of heart, baptized him
with the elemental water which was at hand. On being examined by the
consistory of the Right Reverend the Archbishop, this preceptor, who is
now invested with a chaplaincy, said that he did not know whether the
child was the little son of Lazarus; nay, his supposition had been far
stronger, that it was the son of a Jewish tailor.",1483-1600,33795

"He then fixed his head-quarters at Shima, but from this he speedily
removed; and, passing Emfras, came to Dobit, a favourite residence of
the emperor Jacob, where he held a council to determine which of the
two provinces he should first assist. It was the general opinion of his officers, that to march at that
time of the year into Tigré by Begemder, was to destroy the army,
and distress both provinces; that an army, well provided with horse,
was necessary for acting with success against the Galla, and that,
in effect, though the royal army at present was so appointed, yet
there was no grass at that time of the year in all that march for the
subsistence of the cavalry, and very little water for the use of man
or beast, an inconvenience the Galla themselves must experience if
they attempted an invasion that way. It was, moreover, urged, that,
if the king should march through Woggora and Lamalmon, they might get
more food for their beasts, and water too; but then they would throw
themselves far from the place where the Galla had entered, and would be
obliged to fall into the former road, with the inconveniencies already
stated. The consequence of this deliberation was, that it was with
very great regret the good of the common-weal obliged them to leave
Tigré to the protection of Providence alone for a time, and hasten to
meet the enemy that were then laying Gojam waste.",1700-1800,54181

Hospital, an establishment which does more honour to the heart of
England than anything else that I am acquainted with. The hospital
stands close to the town, where, on Easter Monday, it was my good
fortune to behold the festivity known as Greenwich Fair. I remember little more of it than a confusion of unwashed and shabbily
dressed people, such as we never see in our own country. On our side of

"All this Mr. Wesley explained to the people, and told them if they
believed this and loved and followed the Saviour that died for them,
they would always be happy, and God would give them His own peace, the
peace He has promised to those that love Him. One wonders how the clergymen could disapprove of such preaching, and
why they should shut Mr. Wesley out of their pulpit, for if they did not
preach this same Gospel they certainly ought to have done. However, Mr. Wesley got much larger congregations outside the churches
than they ever got inside, and wherever he went hundreds of people
believed the wonderful story he told them, and became true followers of
the Lord Jesus Christ. Strange things happened at his services; some of
the people were so overjoyed at what they heard they could not help
shouting ""Hurrah!"" and ""Hallelujah!""",1800-1900,32669
"The madman is now soundly sleeping where the fanatic
had in vain sought for repose--and the knave unwillingly suffering for
theft where the hypocrite had voluntarily confined himself! From a crowd of these reflections, which, like mushrooms, rapidly
grew up by the light of the moon, I was aroused by Katherinchen and
her satellite Luy, whose heads (scarcely visible from the shadow of
the great gateway), pointing homewards, mildly hinted that it was
time I should return there; but on my entering the convent, rather an
odd scene presented itself. The supper of the lunatics, distributed
in separate plates, being ready in the great kitchen, like a pack
of hounds, they were all of a sudden let loose, and their appetites
sufficiently governing their judgments, each was deemed perfectly
competent to hunt for his own food, which was no sooner obtained,
than, like an ant, he busily carried it off to his cell. The prisoners
were also fed from another kitchen at the same hour; and as certain
cravings, which with considerable dignity I had long repressed, were
painfully irritated by the very savoury smells which assailed me,
stopping for a moment, I most gladly partook of the madman's fare, and
then, full of soup and of the odd scenes I had witnessed, leisurely
seating myself in my saddle, guided by Katherinchen, and followed
by Luy, we retraced our intricate paths through the forest, until,
late at night, we found ourselves once again in sight of the little
lamps which light up the garden and bowers of my resting-place, or

"It was also in
_Germany_, in many Places; and is not yet wholly conquer'd. Of this Distemper, Dr. _Ramazzini_ made a particular Dissertation; in
which he inquir'd into the Causes of the Distemper, and what Remedies
might be us'd, to put a stop to its violent Course. It is evident, that this Distemper in Cows and Oxen was a true Fever, from
the coldness of the Cattle at first, which was soon succeeded by a violent
burning, with a quick Pulse. That this Fever was pestilential, its
concomitant Symptoms plainly show, as difficulty of breathing, a
Drowziness at the beginning; a continued Flux of a nauseous Matter from
the Nose and Mouth, fetid Dung, sometimes with Blood, Pustules breaking
out over the whole Body on the fifth or sixth Day, like the _Small-Pox_;
they generally dyed about the fifth or seventh Day. The Author tells us, that out of a great Drove, such as the Merchants
bring yearly into _Italy_ out of _Dalmatia_ and the bordering Countries,
one Beast happen'd to straggle from the rest, and be left behind; which a
Cowherd brought to a Farm belonging to the Count _Borromeo_: This Beast
infected all the Cows and Oxen of the Place where he was taken in, with
the same Distemper he labour'd under; the Beast it self dying in a few
Days, as did all the rest, except one only, who had a Rowel put into his
Neck.",1700-1800,31807

"Lastly, the citation of what was done among the
Germans is the statement of a fact, but not of a law, for while there was
a contention between the Emperor Henry IV, and the Roman Pontiff, and
also between his son and the nobles of the Empire, both divine and
human laws were equally confused, so that at the time the laity rashly
attempted to administer sacred things, to use filth instead of holy oil,
to baptize, and to do much else foreign to the Christian religion. The
clergy likewise went beyond their sphere--a precedent which cannot be
cited as law. Neither was it regarded unjust to dissolve sacrilegious
marriages which had been contracted to no effect in opposition to vows
and the sanction of fathers and councils; as even today the marriages of
priests with their so-called wives are not valid.",1483-1600,853

Speculations, which tend to make no body the better) as necessary to
Salvation; for Wise Men, and such who will take Courage to examine what

"The deeds are not stated to be signed but
only to be sealed. Next we come to the three supposed signatures upon the will, dated March
25th, 1616. Twenty or twenty-five years ago, on several occasions I
examined with powerful glasses Shakespeare's will at Somerset House,
where for my convenience it was placed in a strong light, and I arrived
at the only possible conclusion, viz., that the supposed signatures were
all written by the law clerk who wrote the body of the will, and who
wrote also the names of the witnesses, all of which, excepting his
own which is written in a neat modern looking hand, are in the same
handwriting as the will itself. The fact that Shakespeare's name is written by the law clerk has been
conclusively proved by Magdalene Thumm-Kintzel in the Leipzig Magazine,
""Der Menschenkenner,"" of January, 1909, in which photo reproductions of
certain letters in the body of the will and in the so-called signatures
are placed side by side, and the evidence is conclusive that they are
written by the same hand. Moreover, the will was originally drawn to
be sealed, because the solicitor must have known that the illiterate
householder of Stratford was unable to write his name.",1600-1700,47425
"At last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any good in
the framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World of her own
Invention, and this World was composed of sensitive and rational
self-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed onely of the Rational, which
is the subtilest and purest degree of Matter; for as the Sensitive did
move and act both to the perceptions and consistency of the body, so
this degree of Matter at the same point of time (for though the degrees
are mixt, yet the several parts may move several ways at one time) did
move to the Creation of the Imaginary World; which World after it was
made, appear'd so curious and full of variety, so well order'd and
wisely govern'd, that it cannot possibly be expressed by words, nor the
delight and pleasure which the Duchess took in making this World-of-her-own. In the mean time the Empress was also making and dissolving several
Worlds in her own mind, and was so puzled, that she could not settle in
any of them; wherefore she sent for the Duchess, who being ready to wait
on the Empress, carried her beloved World along with her, and invited
the Empress's Soul to observe the Frame, Order and Government of it. Her
Majesty was so ravished with the perception of it, that her Soul desired
to live in the Duchess's World: But the Duchess advised her to make such
another World in her own mind; for, said she, your Majesty's mind is
full of rational corporeal motions; and the rational motions of my mind
shall assist you by the help of sensitive expressions, with the best
Instructions they are able to give you. The Empress being thus perswaded by the Duchess to make an imaginary
World of her own, followed her advice; and after she had quite finished
it, and framed all kinds of Creatures proper and useful for it,
strengthened it with good Laws, and beautified it with Arts and
Sciences; having nothing else to do, unless she did dissolve her
Imaginary World, or made some alterations in the Blazing-World, she
lived in; which yet she could hardly do, by reason it was so well
ordered that it could not be mended; for it was governed without secret
and deceiving Policy; neither was there any ambitious, factions,
malicious detractions, civil dissentions, or home-bred quarrels,
divisions in Religion, Foreign Wars, &c. but all the people lived in a
peaceful society, united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity. she was

than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my
honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can
conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these
precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my retirement, I found
him standing before me, a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my
eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no power to utter a cry,
nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one, as he immediately
approached me, and taking me in his arms (for, overwhelmed as I was, I
was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began to make such professions
to me that I know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing
them up to seem so like truth; and the traitor contrived that his tears
should vouch for his words, and his sighs for his sincerity. ""I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases such
as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying protestations
true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything more
than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passed
away, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I said to him with
more courage than I thought I could have possessed, 'If, as I am now in
your arms, senor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my
deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything to the
prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say
it, than it would be possible that what was should not have been; so
then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by
virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will see if you
attempt to carry them into effect by force.",1600-1700,5912
"Nevertheless, could anything be more cruel than to abandon a
man in a desert country, without arms and without provisions, to put
him on shore in a country peopled by ferocious cannibals, prepared
to make a repast on his flesh; what was it but condemning him to a
horrible death? On the 29th of February, 1600, De Noort, after having been
ninety-nine days in passing through the strait, came out on to the
Pacific Ocean. A fortnight later, a storm separated him from the
_Hendrik Fredrik_, which was never again heard of. As for De Noort,
who had now with him only one yacht besides his own vessel, he cast
anchor at the island of Mocha, and, unlike the experience of his
predecessors, he was very well received by the natives. Afterwards
he sailed along the coast of Chili, where he was able to obtain
provisions in abundance in exchange for Nuremberg knives, hatchets,
shirts, hats, and other articles of no great value.",1700-1800,24777

"Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she
asked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla, so
satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room, and
left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until she had
told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to see
Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him and her
handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of
serious importance. There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so
great was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good reason
to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness,
she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed;
and that same night, as soon as she thought that Anselmo was asleep, she
packed up the most valuable jewels she had and some money, and without
being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to
Lothario's, to whom she related what had occurred, imploring him to
convey her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be
safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced
Lothario was such that he was unable to utter a word in reply, still less

_Of the Stanzas of 10 and of 12 Verses._


The Stanzas of 10 and 12 Verses are seldom employed in our Poetry, it
being very difficult to confine our selves to a certain Disposition of
Rhyme, and measure of Verse, for so many Lines together; for which
Reason those of 4, 6, and 8 Verses are the most frequent. However we
sometimes find some of 10 and 12; as in _Cowley's_ Ode which he calls
_Verses left upon a Wager_, where the Rhymes follow one another, but the
Verses differ in Number of Syllables. _As seen hereafter will I Wagers lay
        'Gainst what an Oracle shall say:
      Fool that I was to venture to deny
        A Tongue so us'd to Victory. A Tongue so blest by Nature and by Art,
    That never yet it spoke, but gain'd a Heart. Tho' what you said had not been true,
        If spoke by any else but you;

"Your husband must not be left to himself. That is a vital point. Still so long as he is reasonable, and shows no

"Simultaneously with the issue of this extraordinary
confession came the news that Admiral Alexeieff with his staff had left
Port Arthur and proceeded to Harbin, at the junction of the Manchurian
railway and the branch line to Vladivostock, there to effect a
concentration of all the available Russian forces. [Sidenote: Desperate Efforts]

These facts combined were generally taken as indicating the intention
of the Czar's Government to abandon Port Arthur and Southern Manchuria,
for the time being, to their fate, and to make the first real stand
against the enemy on the borders of Eastern Siberia. Desperate,
however, as the situation appeared to be in these early days of the
war, it undoubtedly improved somewhat in the next few weeks, and the
delay which the severe climatic conditions imposed upon the Japanese
advance necessarily aided the Russians. General Linevitch, commander of
the Siberian Army Corps, to whom the direction of military affairs was
entrusted pending the arrival of General Kuropatkin, made desperate
exertions to collect an effective force as far south as possible, and
it was regarded as highly probable, from such scraps of news as were
allowed to creep through the censorship, that by the third week of
March he had at his disposal in Southern Manchuria a force of about
50,000 men, the bulk of which was concentrated at Liao-Yang, some forty
or fifty miles below Mukden.",1900-2000,51066

"And now there
remains no more than the fear of her dying to oblige him immediately
to a discovery of his passion, too violent now by his new hope to be
longer concealed, but decency forbids he should now pursue the dear
design; he waited and made vows for her recovery; visited her, and
found _Philander_ the most deplorable object that despair and love
could render him, who lay eternally weeping on her bed, and no counsel
or persuasion could remove him thence; but if by chance they made him
sensible it was for her repose, he would depart to ease his mind by
new torments, he would rave and tear his delicate hair, sigh and weep
upon _Octavio_'s bosom, and a thousand times begin to unfold the
story, already known to the generous rival; despair, and hopes of pity
from him, made him utter all: and one day, when by the advice of the
physician he was forced to quit the chamber to give her rest, he
carried _Octavio_ to his own, and told him from the beginning, all the
story of his love with the charming _Sylvia_, and with it all the
story of his fate: _Octavio_ sighing (though glad of the opportunity)
told him his affairs were already but too well known, and that he
feared his safety from that discovery, since the States had obliged
themselves to harbour no declared enemy to the _French_ King. At this
news our young unfortunate shewed a resentment that was so moving,
that even _Octavio_, who felt a secret joy at the thoughts of his
departure, could no longer refrain from pity and tenderness, even to a
wish that he were less unhappy, and never to part from _Sylvia_: but
love soon grew again triumphant in his heart, and all he could say
was, that he would afford him the aids of all his power in this
encounter; which, with the acknowledgements of a lover, whose life
depended on it, he received, and parted with him, who went to learn
what was decreed in Council concerning him. While _Philander_ returned
to _Sylvia_, the most dejected lover that ever fate produced, when he
had not sighed away above an hour, but received a billet by
_Octavio_'s page from his lord; he went to his own apartment to read
it, fearing it might contain something too sad for him to be able to
hold his temper at the reading of, and which would infallibly have
disturbed the repose of _Sylvia_, who shared in every cruel thought of
_Philander_'s: when he was alone he opened it, and read this. OCTAVIO _to_ PHILANDER.",1600-1700,8409

THE LAKE OF THE LOVERS, A LEGEND OF LEITRIM. How many lovely spots in this our beautiful country are never embraced
within those pilgrimages after the picturesque, which numbers
periodically undertake, rather to see what is known to many, and
therefore should be so to them, than to visit nature, for her own sweet
sake, in her more devious and undistinguished haunts! For my part, I
am well pleased that the case stands thus. I love to think that I am
treading upon ground unsullied by the footsteps of the now numerous
tribe of mere professional peripatetics--that my eyes are wandering over
scenery, the freshness of which has been impaired by no transfer to the
portfolio of the artist or the tablets of the poetaster: that, save
the scattered rustic residents, there is no human link to connect its
memorials with the days of old, and, save their traditionary legends, no
story to tell of its fortunes in ancient times. The sentiment is no doubt
selfish as well as anti-utilitarian; but then I must add that it is only
occasional, and will so far be pardoned by all who know how delightful
it is to take refuge in the indulgent twilight of tradition from the
rugged realities of recorded story.",1600-1700,54624

angelic and more devoid of significance at each new reproduction. The
eyes get larger, the features are less marked, and we have a hero of
Romance, a dreamy, sentimental youth, the apocryphal Bernardin de

seated at a cottage door, his eyes cast up to heaven, his handkerchief
in his hand, while his dog fixes his eyes tenderly upon him, and a
negress contemplates him with rapture.",1700-1800,58723
"Although the archbishop knew this, he left his house, going
through the streets with a great disturbance, and attended with tapers,
to consult with the religious orders whether he could excommunicate
me; for he asserted that I had broken into his prison and taken away
his prisoners. His fiscal hastened to tell him that the chaplain
was already in his prison, at which the archbishop became quiet and
returned to his house. He would not allow the chaplain to appeal to
the bishop of Camarines; so the latter appealed for royal aid against
fuerza--the archbishop having detained him six or eight days in prison
because he would not pay the twelve pesos which he had been fined for
having rung the bells for the _Gloria_ too early. The fine was paid
by a friend of his; and thereupon he was allowed to leave the prison. After that, the archdeacon, Don Francisco de Valdes (who had been
presented for that dignity by Don Juan Cereso de Salamanca), finding
that his health was impaired, and being offended at the abusive
language that the archbishop used, whenever he felt so inclined,
to him and the other members of the chapter, in the choir, handed to
the prelate his resignation of the said dignity--as much because he
could not fulfil its duties on account of his infirmities, as for

it, of a turn in the river, now lead- beneath a dreary sky, and
of the distant spire of Duckwell Church rising beyond the hazy woods of

"The first thing to be done, continued the Advocate, is to persuade the
provinces to aid the king with all their means to conquer the disunited
provinces--to dispose of the archdukes, in short, and to drive the
Spaniards from the soil--and then, little by little, to make it clear
that there could be no safety for the States except in reducing the whole
body of the Netherlands under the authority of the king. Let his Majesty
begin by conquering and annexing to his crown the provinces nearest him,
and he would then be able to persuade the others to a reasonable
arrangement. Whether the Advocate's general reply was really considered by Buzanval as
a grave sarcasm, politely veiled, may be a question. That envoy, however,
spoke to his Government of the matter as surrounded with difficulties,
but not wholly desperate. Barneveld was, he said, inclined to doubt
whether the archdukes would be able, before any negotiations were begun,

"To anybody who looks at the blood-vessels with an unprejudiced
eye it seems so natural that the blood should all come out of the liver,
and be distributed by the veins to the different parts of the body, that
nothing can seem simpler or more plain; and consequently no one could
make up his mind to dispute this apparently obvious assumption. But
Harvey did dispute it; and when he came to investigate the matter he
discovered that it was a profound mistake, and that, all this time, the
blood had been moving in just the opposite direction, namely, from the
small ramifications of the veins towards the right side of the heart. Harvey further found that, in the arteries, the blood, as had previously
been known, was travelling from the greater trunks towards the
ramifications. Moreover, referring to the ideas of Columbus and of Galen
(for he was a great student of literature, and did justice to all his
predecessors), Harvey accepts and strengthens their view of the course
of the blood through the lungs, and he shows how it fitted into his
general scheme. If you will follow the course of the arrows in Fig.",1600-1700,2939

"""It is manifest that a court would subsist as difficultly without this
kind of coin as a trading city without paper credit. Indeed, they differ
in this, that their value is not quite so certain, and a favorite may
protest his smile without the danger of bankruptcy. ""In the midst of all this glory the emperor died, and Anastasius was
preferred to the crown. As it was yet uncertain whether I should not
continue in favor, I was received as usual at my entrance into the
palace to pay my respects to the new emperor; but I was no sooner rumped
by him than I received the same compliment from all the rest; the whole
room, like a regiment of soldiers, turning their backs to me all at
once: my smile now was become of equal value with the note of a broken
banker, and every one was as cautious not to receive it. ""I made as much haste as possible from the court, and shortly after
from the city, retreating to the place of my nativity, where I spent the
remainder of my days in a retired life in husbandry, the only amusement
for which I was qualified, having neither learning nor virtue.",1700-1800,1147
"Now it happened
that three good fairies who resided in the neighbourhood of the
Oetz-Thal, beneath an enormous mountain peak called the Morin, had been
invisibly active in the saving of the goat-herd's boy. The boy grew up and always bore in his mind an attraction to the
highest peaks of the mountains; he became a hardy Alpine climber and
clever mountain shot, and as such a secret impulse ever pushed him
to the heights above Morin, for there--so said the legend--was the
Paradise of animals; there were herds of gazelles and stone-bucks, and
no huntsman had ever succeeded in approaching them. But the fool-hardy
boy wished to try his luck, and commenced his wanderings, which ended
by his getting lost, and being in danger of his life. One day he didn't
know where he was, and from the ice-covered peak which reaches into the
clouds over ten thousand feet high, he slipped down upon a green Alp
which he had been unable to see from above, and in that fall he lost
his senses.",1800-1900,46047

sat three hours, with Lady Jemimah with us, talking and laughing, and by
and by my Lady Carteret comes, and she and I to talke, I glad to please
her in discourse of Sir G. Carteret, that all will do well with him, and
she is much pleased, he having had great annoyance and fears about his
well doing, and I fear hath doubted that I have not been a friend to him,
but cries out against my Lady Castlemaine, that makes the King neglect his
business and seems much to fear that all will go to wracke, and I fear
with great reason; exclaims against the Duke of Albemarle, and more the
Duchesse for a filthy woman, as indeed she is. Here staid till 9 o'clock
almost, and then took coach with so much love and kindnesse from my Lady
Carteret, Lady Jemimah, and Lady Slaving, that it joys my heart, and when
I consider the manner of my going hither, with a coach and four horses and
servants and a woman with us, and coming hither being so much made of, and
used with that state, and then going to Windsor and being shewn all that
we were there, and had wherewith to give every body something for their
pains, and then going home, and all in fine weather and no fears nor cares
upon me, I do thinke myself obliged to thinke myself happy, and do look
upon myself at this time in the happiest occasion a man can be, and
whereas we take pains in expectation of future comfort and ease, I have
taught myself to reflect upon myself at present as happy, and enjoy myself
in that consideration, and not only please myself with thoughts of future
wealth and forget the pleasure we at present enjoy. So took coach and to
Windsor, to the Garter, and thither sent for Dr. Childe;  who come to us,
and carried us to St. George's Chappell; and there placed us among the
Knights' stalls (and pretty the observation, that no man, but a woman may
sit in a Knight's place, where any brass-plates are set); and hither come

"When Garrick played Richard II in slashed
trunk hose and plumes, it was not because he believed that the
Plantagenets dressed like that, or because the costumes could not have
made him a XV century dress as easily as a nondescript combination of
the state robes of George III with such scraps of older fashions as
seemed to playgoers for some reason to be romantic. The charm of the
theatre in those days was its makebelieve. It has that charm still, not
only for the amateurs, who are happiest when they are most unnatural
and impossible and absurd, but for audiences as well. I have seen
performances of my own plays which were to me far wilder burlesques
than Sheridan's Critic or Buckingham's Rehearsal; yet they have
produced sincere laughter and tears such as the most finished
metropolitan productions have failed to elicit. Fielding was entirely
right when he represented Partridge as enjoying intensely the
performance of the king in Hamlet because anybody could see that the
king was an actor, and resenting Garrick's Hamlet because it might have
been a real man.",1900-2000,3830

Cocke, we parted and to our yacht; but it being calme, we to make haste,

great difficultys, our simple, yet confident waterman, not knowing a step
of the way; and we found ourselves to go backward and forward, which, in
the darke night and a wild place, did vex us mightily. At last we got a
fisher boy by chance, and took him into the boat, and being an odde kind
of boy, did vex us too; for he would not answer us aloud when we spoke to
him, but did carry us safe thither, though with a mistake or two; but I
wonder they were not more. In our way I was [surprised] and so were we
all, at the strange nature of the sea-water in a darke night, that it
seemed like fire upon every stroke of the oare, and, they say, is a sign

as for Vehicles, they are but fancies, not real truths. Then the Empress
asked them, Where Heaven and Hell was? Your Saviour Christ, answered the
Spirits, has informed you, that there is Heaven and Hell, but he did not
tell you what, nor where they are; wherefore it is too great a
presumption for you Mortals to inquire after it: If you do but strive to
get into Heaven, it is enough, though you do not know where or what it
is; for it is beyond your knowledg and understanding. I am satisfied,
replied the Empress; and asked further, Whether there were any Figures
or Characters in the Soul? They answered, Where there was no Body, there
could be no Figure.",1600-1700,51783
"The remark made by a
celebrated French writer is [worthy] of note: that if the ministers
of the king of España in the Indias were not so dishonest the
royal incomes would amount to more than those of all the powers of
Europa. The vassal complies with the obligation which rests on him,
but the kings do not fulfil theirs; for they let go without punishment
all the theft, all the robbery, all the iniquity committed by their
ministers. I am well aware that there cannot be government among men
without these defects and vices, which without exception are utterly
incurable, and all the nations of the world have committed them from
the time of Adam; but he who knows our general misgovernment of the
Indias and the numberless robberies which are committed [therein] will
be astounded to see that the criminals are not punished.",1700-1800,54740
"The Maritime Canal Company has lodged a protest against this
action, alleging rights in the premises which appear worthy of
consideration. This Government expects that Nicaragua will afford the
protestants a full and fair hearing upon the merits of the case. The Nicaragua Canal Commission, which had been engaged upon the work of
examination and survey for a ship-canal route across Nicaragua, having
completed its labors and made its report, was dissolved on May P, and on
June To a new commission, known as the Isthmian Canal Commission, was
organized under the terms of the act approved March 3, 1899, for the
purpose of examining the American Isthmus with a view to determining the
most practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across that Isthmus,
with its probable cost, and other essential details. This Commission, under the presidency of Rear-Admiral John G. Walker, U. S.
N. (retired), entered promptly upon the work intrusted to it, and is now
carrying on examinations in Nicaragua along the route of the Panama Canal,
and in Darien from the Atlantic, in the neighborhood of the Atrato River,
to the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Good progress has been made, but
under the law a comprehensive and complete investigation is called for,
which will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplishment.",1800-1900,5031
"During the
eighteenth century the proportion of Fellow Commoners was probably from
one-fourth to one-third of those dining together, and constraint on both
sides must have been almost inevitable. The terms ""don"" and
""donnishness"" seem to have acquired their uncomplimentary meaning about
this period. The precise significance of ""don"" is not easy to express
concisely; the most felicitous is perhaps that of the Oxford _Shotover
Papers_, where we read that don means, in Spain, a gentleman; in
England, a Fellow. The abolition of the Fellow Commoner was perhaps
chiefly due to the rise of the democratic spirit and a general dislike
of privilege, but there are other grounds for welcoming it. Of the individuals who make up the stream of youthful life which has
ebbed and flowed through the College gate there is but little official
record.",1600-1700,27320
"The Consequences of all which will be,
the strength of the _Trunk_, the security and plenty of the _Sap_, its
Fermentation will be quicker, its Distribution more effectual, and its
Advancement more sufficient. First, the erect growth and strength of the _Trunk_; this being by the
position of its several parts effected: For besides the slendering of
the _Trunk_ still towards the top, the Circumferential position of the
_Lignous Body_ likewise is, and that eminently hereunto subservient: So
that as the _Lignous Body_ in the smaller part of the _Root_ standing
Central, we may thence conceive and see their pliableness to any
oblique motion; so here, on the contrary, the _Lignous Body_ standing
wide, it thus becomes the strength of the _Trunk_, and most advantageous
to its perpendicular growth. We see the same Design in _Bones_ and
_Feathers_: The strongest _Bones_, as those in the Legs, are hollow.",1600-1700,58138

men at home on the sea, and well able to contend with wind and wave,
rather than write of ships with sails torn to shreds, and crews taking
to drink as soon as they are caught in a close-reefed topsail breeze
off Cape Horn. Steam, no doubt, has much to answer for in having increased, rather
than diminished the apparent terrors of bad weather at sea; causing
writers who draw their experiences of storms from the decks of long
narrow ships driven six or seven knots in the teeth of a gale, to form
exaggerated ideas of tempests, and the behaviour of well handled
sailing craft in the same weathers. A steamer plunges into a head-sea
in a blundering sort of way, wallowing from side to side as she does
so, and shipping water to port or starboard in the most uncertain
manner. The power that drives the great hull against the rolling masses
of water seems to have no sympathy with either the ship or the waves;
and drenched from stem to stern, the vessel reels and staggers on her
way, kept only to her work by careful use of helm.",1700-1800,44471

iron. The chief point which strikes the observer is the variety in the
“height to paper” of the different founts. Taking the six specimens

magistrate, obeying the dictates of his conscience (which some
persons attribute, but without sufficient grounds, to feelings of
personal revenge), had addressed to the king on April 12, 1768, an
exposition which treated of 'the disorders which exist in Filipinas,
and which ought to be corrected.' In this document he points out most
serious abuses among the friars; in the university, which was in their
charge; among the Jesuits; among the Chinese, protected by the friars,
who preferred them before the Spaniards, driving away and expelling
the latter from their villages; and he censures certain frauds and
practices in the public administration in specified branches of the
civil service. The seventy with which Anda laid bare those abuses drew
upon him the hatred of the friars. [16] In this document he demanded a
remedy for the disorders which he denounced, pointing out the method
by which this might be effected, and declared that 'for the radical
correction of these evils it is indispensable to draw up and introduce
here a form of procedure which is clear, and capable of securing the
just system which corresponds thereto, conferring upon the governor
all the powers necessary for carrying it into execution, by those
measures which prudence and the actual condition of affairs shall
dictate to him.' He added: 'The choice of a zealous governor will
materially contribute to laying the foundations of that great work;
but it is necessary to reward him and give him authority, so that he
can work to advantage, and without the hindrances which have often,
by means of secret communications, cunning and disloyal maneuvers, and
other malicious proceedings, frustrated the best and most carefully
formed plans.'",1700-1800,57189

crocodile, however, lays eggs the size of those of the goose; nor does
any animal attain to larger dimensions from a smaller beginning. It

contained had some connexion with its fecundity, inasmuch as the very

him pass from the open into the fringe of timber near the big gap;
and, a few minutes later, saw him reappear beyond the deer lick. Still she watched as he moved along the rim of the Hollow, looking

that they had been in sight of two or three other ships of the enemy,

that we should stand to the northward, and make the best of our way

"There were six of them coming along under their
sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that
this must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he
could those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one
made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing
and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance
ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the
middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,
for such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come

name was written, but he remarked also that leaves were likewise missing
from other quires in the same note-book, and certain witnesses testified
that the colonel had a habit of tearing out pages when he wanted to
light a cigar--therefore nothing was more probable than that, by an
oversight, he had burned the address he had copied. Further, it was
shown that the mayor could not have read the note-book on receiving it
from Maddalena Pietri, on account of the darkness, and it was proved
that he had not stopped an instant before he went into his house, that
the sergeant of the gendarmes had gone there with him, and had seen him
light a lamp and put the note-book into an envelope which he had sealed

"In the evening, at twelve, our ship, having received previous visits
from all the necessary parties, took the advantage of the tide, and
having sailed up to Lisbon cast anchor there, in a calm and moonshiny
night, which made the passage incredibly pleasant to the women, who
remained three hours enjoying it, whilst I was left to the cooler
transports of enjoying their pleasures at second-hand; and yet, cooler
as they may be, whoever is totally ignorant of such sensation is, at the
same time, void of all ideas of friendship. Wednesday.--Lisbon, before which we now lay at anchor, is said to be
built on the same number of hills with old Rome; but these do not all
appear to the water; on the contrary, one sees from thence one vast high
hill and rock, with buildings arising above one another, and that in so
steep and almost perpendicular a manner, that they all seem to have but
one foundation. As the houses, convents, churches, &c., are large, and all built with
white stone, they look very beautiful at a distance; but as you approach
nearer, and find them to want every kind of ornament, all idea of beauty
vanishes at once. While I was surveying the prospect of this city,
which bears so little resemblance to any other that I have ever seen, a
reflection occurred to me that, if a man was suddenly to be removed from
Palmyra hither, and should take a view of no other city, in how
glorious a light would the ancient architecture appear to him! and what
desolation and destruction of arts and sciences would he conclude had
happened between the several eras of these cities!",1700-1800,1146
"Their are some that carry their Sand with them, as _Foulgere_,

that nothing can compare with it, nor Gold it self, nor Glasse. This
Earth then, so excellent, and incorruptible, is not this vile and
grosse Element, that we trample on, and cultivate to draw there hence

21. of the _Revel._ clear and transparent: _I saw a new Heaven and a
new Earth, and the holy City was of pure Gold, like unto pure Glasse,
and the streets thereof were of shining and resplendent Gold_: See how
hee doth liken more then once Gold and Glasse, which is produced by
the depurations of Fire: for that is the last action thereof, having
therein no power but to refine and depure, as he doth Gold. Which the
Sun produceth in long millions of years: To the imitation of that, the
speculative understandings are forced by means of fire, to extract
out of the corruption of these inferior elements, and their compounds
and incorruptible substance, which was to them a modell and pattern
of that, whereto the whole universe should at last bee reduced: from
hence we here draw from Soot a representation and image of the works
of nature, upon vapours and exhalations, whence Meteors are formed,
and impressions from the middle Region of the Air, Water holding place
of the waterish, and oil of the fiery, and inflamable, which oil is
altogether impure, to bee adustible and unprofitable to the procreation
of this Virgin Earth: called by some the Philosophers Stone, which
so many ignorant avaricious men have sought for, but could not find
because they sought it with blind eyes, darkened with a sordid desire
of unlawfull gain: to make themselves on a sodain richer then another
_Midas_, who at last got nought, but the ears of an Asse, and did not
cherish it to praise and admire God in his admirable workes following
that which is said in the 37. of _Job_, consider the wondrous works
of God, for we cannot doe a greater pleasure to a workman, then to
mark attentively, to admire and magnifie his works; nor a greater
reproch then to scorn and slight them: And of such the Apostle in the
4. to the _Ephes._ speaketh thus, _They have their thoughts obscured
with darknesse, being alienated from the life of God, because of the
ignorance that is in them, in respect of blindnesse of their heart_:
Take then this Oil so extracted from Soot, and repasse it three or
four times upon Sand; for it is one of those, that lasteth very long. And after the extraction of the Water and Oil, and the Calcination
of the earths, that shall remain in the bottome of the vessell, cast

me to hold it in mind (as for himself, he knew he could not live till
my return), that I should not offer by any means hereafter to invade the
strong parts of Guiana without the help of all those nations which were
also their enemies; for that it was impossible without those, either to
be conducted, to be victualled, or to have aught carried with us, our
people not being able to endure the march in so great heat and travail,
unless the borderers gave them help, to cart with them both their meat
and furniture. For he remembered that in the plains of Macureguarai
three hundred Spaniards were overthrown, who were tired out, and had
none of the borderers to their friends; but meeting their enemies as
they passed the frontier, were environed on all sides, and the people
setting the long dry grass on fire, smothered them, so as they had no
breath to fight, nor could discern their enemies for the great smoke. He
told me further that four days' journey from his town was Macureguarai,
and that those were the next and nearest of the subjects of Inga, and of
the Epuremei, and the first town of apparelled and rich people; and that
all those plates of gold which were scattered among the borderers and
carried to other nations far and near, came from the said Macureguarai
and were there made, but that those of the land within were far finer,
and were fashioned after the images of men, beasts, birds, and fishes. I
asked him whether he thought that those companies that I had there with
me were sufficient to take that town or no; he told me that he thought
they were.",1483-1600,2272

"But no modification could make it into an Honour

reason that the study of English Literature cannot be isolated from the

single language or dialect from the group to which it belongs, that he
could isolate Anglo-Saxon from Gothic, or Middle English from
Anglo-Saxon, the Celtic of the Cymbry from the Celtic of the Gaels, is
not greater than to assume that the study of our Literature can be
severed from the study of those literatures which stand in precisely the
same relation to it as one of those dialects stands to the others in the
same group. If the legislators of this School decline to reform it, then it is the
duty of Oxford--a duty which she owes alike to education and to her own
honour--to counteract the mischief which this institution must, by
degrading throughout England and the colonies the whole level of liberal
instruction and study on its most important side, inevitably do. To the
herd of imperfectly and erroneously disciplined teachers which this
institution will turn loose on education, let her oppose, at least, a
minority which shall worthily represent her.",1900-2000,34370
"If they
met a sinner, they tenderly besought him to be reconciled to God,
to give up his sins, ""flee from the wrath to come,"" and start at
once for Heaven. If they met in each other's houses, they
gathered around the organ or the piano and sang hymns and songs,
and did not part till they had united in prayer. There was no criticising of their neighbours, no grumbling and
complaining about the weather, no fault-finding with their lot in
life, or their daily surroundings and circumstances. Their
conversation was joyous, cheerful, and helpful to one another. Nor was it forced and out of place, but rather it was the
natural, spontaneous outflow of loving, humble, glad hearts
filled with the Spirit, in union with Jesus, and in love and
sympathy with their fellow-men.",1900-2000,6135
"The night seemed interminable,
as if the car of time were driven backward, and she longed
inexpressibly for the dawning of day. Four o'clock came at last;
silence brooded over the town; the western breeze had sung itself to
rest, and there was a solemn hush, as though all nature stood still
to witness the struggle between dusky Azrael and a human soul. Clara
slept.",1800-1900,4246
"Maynard finding his own sloop had way, and would soon be on board,
ordered his men all down below, for fear of another broadside, which
would have been his total destruction. He himself was the only man that
kept the deck, even the man at the helm lying down snug; the men in the
hold were ordered to get their pistols and cutlasses ready for close
fighting, and to come up the companion at a moment's signal. Two ladders
were placed in the hatchway ready for the word.",1700-1800,38633
"Mrs. Macquarie was prevented
from writing by ill health at the time I left the colony, but desired me
to communicate the fact as she had herself intended. That several of
those who went out in the Lord Wellington behaved very ill after their
arrival, does not militate against the system of reform adopted by the
Ladies’ Committee; nor would my opinion of its invaluable efficacy be
altered in the least, were I told that every one of those who were under
my care has been ruined in the colony, because I know what a state of
depravity prevails there. Minds much stronger than theirs have yielded
to temptation; and in no country is that evil more concentrated and
destructive than in New South Wales. With respect to the rising generation in the colony, I have not
sufficient data to enable me to speak with certainty; but it may be
stated that, notwithstanding the boundless depravity of the parents, the
children, generally speaking, are well disposed, given to industry, and
of religious habits.",1800-1900,53643
"One can get used to

"It may, however, be a direction in case of the approach of a like
visitation, which God keep the city from;--I say, it may be of use to
observe that by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at that time in
distributing weekly great sums of money for relief of the poor, a
multitude of people who would otherwise have perished, were relieved,
and their lives preserved. And here let me enter into a brief state of
the case of the poor at that time, and what way apprehended from them,
from whence may be judged hereafter what may be expected if the like
distress should come upon the city. At the beginning of the plague, when there was now no more hope but that
the whole city would be visited; when, as I have said, all that had
friends or estates in the country retired with their families; and when,
indeed, one would have thought the very city itself was running out of
the gates, and that there would be nobody left behind; you may be sure
from that hour all trade, except such as related to immediate
subsistence, was, as it were, at a full stop. This is so lively a case, and contains in it so much of the real
condition of the people, that I think I cannot be too particular in it,
and therefore I descend to the several arrangements or classes of people
who fell into immediate distress upon this occasion.",1700-1800,376

"Then the two eminent soldiers, whose names had of late been so
familiar in the mouths of men, shook hands and embraced with heroic
cordiality, while a mighty shout went up from the multitude around. It
was a stately and dramatic spectacle, that peaceful meeting of the rival
leaders in a war which had begun before either of them was born. The
bystanders observed, or thought that they observed, signs of great
emotion on the faces of both. It has also been recorded that each
addressed the other in epigrammatic sentences of compliment.",1483-1600,4884
"Articles Drafted by Luther. In the memorandum of December 1 the Elector spoke of the articles Luther
was to frame as follows: Although, in the first place, it may easily be
perceived that whatsoever our party may propose in such a [popish]
council as has been announced will have no weight with the opposition,
miserable, blinded, and mad men that they are, no matter how well it is
founded on Holy Scripture moreover, everything will have to be Lutheran
heresy, and their verdict, which probably has already been decided and
agreed upon, must be adopted and immediately followed by their proposed
ban and interdict [decree excommunicating and outlawing our party], it
will, nevertheless, be very necessary for Doctor Martin to prepare his
foundation and opinion from the Holy Scriptures, namely, the articles as
hitherto taught, preached, and written by him, and which he is
determined to adhere to and abide by at the council, as well as upon his
departure from this world and before the judgment of Almighty God, and
in which we cannot yield without becoming guilty of treason against God,
even though property and life, peace or war, are at stake. Such articles
however, as are not necessary, and in which for the sake of Christian
love, yet without offense against God and His Word, something might be
yielded (though, doubtless, they will be few in number), should in this
connection also be indicated separately by said Doctor Martin. And when
Doctor Martin has completed such work (which, if at all possible for the
Doctor, must be done between the present date and that of the Conversion
of St. Paul [January 25], at the latest), he shall thereupon present it
to the other Wittenberg theologians, and likewise to some prominent
preachers whose presence he should require to hear from them, at the
same time admonishing them most earnestly, and asking them whether they
agreed with him in these articles which he had drawn up, or not, and
thereupon, as they hoped for their souls salvation their sentiment and
opinion be learned in its entirety, but not in appearance, for the sake
of peace, or because they did not like to oppose the Doctor, and for
this reason would not fully open their hearts, and still, at a later
time would teach, preach, write, and make public something else or
advise the people against said articles, as some have in several
instances done before this. An agreement having been reached, the
articles were to be subscribed by all and prepared in German and Latin.",1700-1800,26909
"To-day was the day. Question

with the reply, would not hurl the Mace at the CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUER, so as to ensure a properly dramatic exit. At last No.",1700-1800,11704

"On the same night, being wednesdaie, the king came to Tutburie, and
lodged in the castell, sending foorth the next day with all speed,
letters to the shiriffe of Derbishire and Notinghamshire, aduertising
him both of the successe he had against his enimies, and withall,
pronouncing them and all their adherents, rebels and traitors to
him and his realme, and that for such they should be reputed, taken
and vsed. Wherefore he commanded in the same letters or writs, vpon
forfeiture of all that the said shiriffe might forfeit, he should
pursue the said rebels, that is, the earles of Lancaster and Hereford,
the lords Roger Damorie, Hugh Audelie the yoonger, Iohn de Mowbraie,
Bartholomew de Badelismere, Roger de Clifford, Iohn Gifford de
Brimesfield, Henrie Tieis, and all and euerie other person or persons
that were of their confederacie, or in their companies; causing hue
and crie to be raised vpon them, in what part soeuer they might be
heard of, and in all places where the said shiriffe should thinke it
expedient, and to inioine and streightlie command all and singular
persons, the said rebels and enimies to pursue, take and arrest, and
them to deliuer vnto the said shiriffe, and that such as were not
able to pursue them, yet with hand or horne they should leuie hue and
crie against them, in paine that being found negligent herein, to be
accompted for fauourers and adherents to the said rebels and traitors,
and that the said shiriffe should therevpon apprehend them, and put
them in prison. The writ was dated at Tutburie the eleuenth of March,
and the like writs were directed and sent foorth to all other shiriffes
through the realme, and likewise to the bishop of Durham, and to the
iustice of Chester. [Sidenote: Proclamations made for the peace to be kept.] Beside this, he directed also other writs to the said shiriffes and
others, that although he had beene constreined to passe in forceable
wise through diuerse parts of his realme, and the marches of Wales, to
suppresse the malicious rebellion of diuerse his subiects, and that
as yet he was constreined to continue his iournie in such forceable
wise, neuertheles his pleasure was, that the peace should be mainteined
and kept throughout his realme, with the statutes, lawes and customes
inuiolated, and therfore he commanded the said shiriffes, that they
should cause the same to be proclaimed in places where was thought
most expedient, as well within liberties as without, inhibiting that
any maner of person, of what state or condition soeuer he was, vpon
paine that might fall thereon, to attempt any thing to the breach of
peace; but that euerie man should seeke to mainteine and preserue the
peace and tranquillitie of the people, with the statutes, lawes and
good customes of the land, to the vttermost of his power: this alwaies
obserued, that the rebels, wheresoeuer they might be found, should be
arrested, and committed to safe custodie.",1483-1600,46669
"It is a curious contradiction in our ideas of propriety, which are
measured apparently by uncertain intervals of time, that we regard as
felonious a man who disinters a body and steals a ring from the fingers
of the corpse a few days after burial in an English churchyard, but we
honour and admire an individual who upon a wholesale scale digs up old
cemeteries and scatters the bones of ancient kings and queens, princes,
priests, and warriors, and having collected the jewellery, arms, and
objects of vanity that were buried with them, neglects the once honoured
bones, but sells the gold and pottery to the highest bidder. Sentiment
is measured and weighed by periods, and as grief is mitigated by time,
so also is our respect for the dead, even until we barter their ashes
for gold as an honourable transaction. The most important object of antiquity that has been recently discovered
by excavations at Dali is the statue of Sargon, king of Assyria, 707
B.C., to whom the Cypriote kings paid tribute. This was sent to the
Berlin Museum by Mr. Hamilton Lang, and is described in his interesting
work upon Cyprus during the term of several years' consulship.",1800-1900,3656
"Despite the tragedy of it all, a little smile went round the group
of onlookers. It meant to say that that was just Ben Thurston all
over—irascible and vindictive. But some faces looked grave. “May go mighty hard with Willoughby,” murmured one voice, that of the
old grey-headed man, the blacksmith at the rancho for twenty years or
more. “I wouldn’t like to feel the weight of the old devil’s hand.”

But just then the automobile came round the house, piloted by Jack

to design a man, or any other thing, by the Hand to the Eye is lesse

"By this
means, he severed from the continent the cities of Dion, Olophyxus,
Acrothoon, Thysus, and Cleone. It is said, however, that Xerxes undertook
this enterprise only out of ostentation, and to perpetuate the memory of
his name, since he might, with far less trouble, have caused his fleet to
be conveyed over the isthmus, as was the practice in those days. He likewise commanded a bridge of boats to be laid over the Hellespont,
for the passing of his forces from Asia into Europe. The sea which
separates Sestos and Abydos, where the bridge was built, is seven furlongs
over. The work was carried on with great expedition by the Phoenicians and
Egyptians, who had no sooner finished it, but a violent storm arising,
broke it in pieces, and dispersed or dashed against the shore the vessels
of which it was composed: which when Xerxes heard, he fell into such a
violent transport of anger, that he commanded three hundred stripes to be
inflicted on the sea, and a pair of fetters to be thrown into it;
enjoining those who were trusted with the execution of his orders, to
pronounce these words:--""Thou salt and bitter element, thy master has
condemned thee to this punishment, for offending him without cause; and is
resolved to pass over thee, in spite of thy billows, and insolent
resistance.""",1800-1900,41983
"That was a bitter voyage for me. I suffered dreadfully
from sickness and from cold in the southern latitudes; and I got plenty
of kicks and cuffs from the mates and the sailors, and plenty of dousing
and sousing with salt water that came sweeping over the ship's sides,
and with hail and rain as we had to turn out of our hammocks at night
when storms were raging, and we had to go up into the shrouds, and out
along the slippering, reeling yards, hanging over the dark, boiling,
roaring seas below. Oh! I often thought of these pleasant fields and
farms, and all my old favourite nooks in the woods and dells, at those
times, and I was often tempted just to drop off the yard-end, and bury
all my troubles in the raging ocean. But I got better of that; the
captain began to notice me for an active, and, as he said, clever
fellow, and I began to like the sea.",1700-1800,43245

comfortable balance at his banker's, considers all despair very weak, very
foolish, and very sinful. He, however, blesses himself that for such
miscreants there is Newgate; and more--there is Sir PETER LAURIE.",1800-1900,14942

of Cahan and his Socialist associates in influencing the taste of the
Ghetto. It was the production of Gordin's drama _Siberia_. Up to that
time, nothing but conventional opera, melodrama, and historical plays
had been given on the Bowery, but the day after the performance of
_Siberia_ the _Arbeiterzeitung_ contained a long review of the play by
Cahan, welcoming it enthusiastically as an event breaking the way for
realistic art in the colony. Since then this type of play has taken a
prominent place in the repertory at the Yiddish theatres.",1900-2000,41028

And he puts into practical life what another of our sages well
expressed when he said: “Occupation and exercise are the hand-maidens
of purity and strength.” Too often we merely read these wise words. The
Indian lives them. In this the white race can well imitate him. He
faces hardship and danger with eagerness that thereby he may develop
courage and strength. He takes his sons and punishes them in what we
should call a cruel manner to develop fortitude; he sends them out

"By some
such logical process, Queen Mary and Bothwell may have satisfied
themselves of the propriety of blowing up Darnley: Mr. and Mrs. Manning,
as they sate at meat with their destined victim over his ready-made
grave, may have argued themselves into self-approval of the crowning
rite with which their hospitalities were to terminate: any scampish
apprentice with designs upon his master's till, any burglar plotting an
entry into a goldsmith's shop, may become convinced of his rectitude of
purpose, and even take credit for public-spirited zeal, in seeking to
appropriate to his own use part of another's wealth, which he may fairly
suppose would be productive of more enjoyment if divided between two or
more than if left in the hands of one, and that one already perhaps the
possessor of more than he knows what to do with. Precisely the same sophistry will not indeed suffice for those disciples
who, adopting the alternative law of the utilitarian code, feel bound to
attend to the consequences not of individual actions, but of classes of
actions. The cleverest self-deceiver can scarcely bring himself to
believe that, because it might suit his personal convenience to kill or
steal, killing and stealing would not be prejudicial to society if
generally practised. Still, it is only necessary to have, or to fancy
one has, public instead of private objects in view, in order to be able
to look with approbation, from an utilitarian point of view, on any
amount of homicide or robbery. It was the very same Robespierre that,
while as yet diocesan judge at Arras, felt constrained to abdicate
because, 'behold, one day comes a culprit whose crime merits hanging,
and strict-minded, strait-laced Max's conscience will not permit the
dooming of any son of Adam to die,' who, shortly after, when
sufficiently imbued with the utilitarian spirit, was fully prepared to
wade through floods of slaughter towards the enthronisation of his
principles--one of those principles evidently being that, if the
decimation of mankind would conduce to the greater happiness of the
residue, adding more to the happiness of the nine-tenths whom it spared
than it took from the tenth whom it destroyed, the said decimation would
be a duty incumbent on any one possessed of power to perpetrate it.",1800-1900,29917

perpetual joy to a grateful man, but pleases an ungrateful one only for
a moment. Can the lives of such men be compared, seeing that the one

defrauder should be, a man who does not give his parents, his nurses, or
his teachers the honour which is their due--while the other is joyous,
cheerful, on the watch for an opportunity of proving his gratitude, and
gaining much pleasure from this frame of mind itself? Such a man has no
wish to become bankrupt, but only to make the fullest and most copious
return for benefits, and that not only to parents and friends, but also
to more humble persons; for even if he receives a benefit from his
own slave, he does not consider from whom he receives it, but what he
receives. XVIII.",1600-1700,3794

some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda,
exclaimed:

impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths."" Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when
Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having retreated
behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside and
regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and said as

it was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all
considerations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and
pressing her face close to his, said, ""Yes, my dear lord, you are the

A RETROSPECT


In the beginning of the long and fascinating history of Italian Art we
see that the spirit of the Renaissance first fluttered over the minds
of men much as the spirit of life is said have moved over the face of
the waters before the first chapter of creation's marvellous story was
written. Beginnings were small, progress was slow, and the lives of
the great artists moved very unevenly to their appointed end. There were some who rose to fame and fortune during their life, and
then died so completely that no biography can hope to rouse any
interest in their work among succeeding generations. There were others who worked in silence and without _reclame_ of any
sort, content with the respect and esteem of those with whom they came
into immediate contact, indifferent to the plaudits of the crowd or
the noisy praises of those who are not qualified to judge. True
servants of the western world's religion, they translated work into
terms of moral life, and moral life into terms of work.",1900-2000,42163
"I confess I have
sucked in so much of the sad story of Queen Elizabeth, from my cradle,
that I was ready to weep for her sometimes; but the play is the most
ridiculous that sure ever come upon the stage; and, indeed, is merely a
shew, only shews the true garbe of the Queen in those days, just as we see
Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth painted; but the play is merely a puppet
play, acted by living puppets. Neither the design nor language better;
and one stands by and tells us the meaning of things: only I was pleased
to see Knipp dance among the milkmaids, and to hear her sing a song to
Queen Elizabeth; and to see her come out in her night-gowne with no lockes
on, but her bare face and hair only tied up in a knot behind; which is the
comeliest dress that ever I saw her in to her advantage. Thence home and
went as far as Mile End with Sir W. Pen, whose coach took him up there for
his country-house; and after having drunk there, at the Rose and Crowne, a
good house for Alderman Bides ale,--[John Bide, brewer, Sheriff of London
in 1647.--B.] --we parted, and we home, and there I finished my letters,
and then home to supper and to bed. 18th (Lord's day).",1600-1700,4179

"He then took his departure and I was left, I know
not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left agitated and
troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, and I had
not the spirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid for the
treachery she had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my
chamber; for as yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had
befallen me was for good or evil. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as
I was now his, he might see me on other nights in the same way, until it
should be his pleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the
following night, he came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch
a glimpse of him in the street or in church, while I wearied myself with
watching for one; although I knew he was in the town, and almost every
day went out hunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how
sad and dreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I
began to doubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith
of Don Fernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in
reproof of her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was
forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my
countenance, not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so
melancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was
suddenly brought to an end, for the time came when all such
considerations were disregarded, and there was no further question of
honour, when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known
abroad. The reason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town
that Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of
rare beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though
not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a
match; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the
betrothal some strange things had happened.""",1600-1700,5912

"About their waists they tied the dancing
girdle, never worn except on these occasions, and made of twisted green
ferns. The men took off their cool, easy everyday costume, of a short
cotton kilt and gay  singlet, and attired themselves in shirts
and heavy stuff trousers (bought from the trader at enormous expense,
and considered the acme of smartness). Both sexes crowned themselves
with the curious dancing headdress, which looks exactly like the
long-rayed halo of a saint, and is made by splitting a palm frond down
the middle, and fastening it in a half-circle about the back of the
head.",1900-2000,54499

"To show the excellences of the art and the
lovableness of the artist rather than to hunt for defects is the duty
and the delight of the teacher of literature. This does not mean,
however, that one dare never see the weaker side, the foibles and
eccentricities of the man of genius. I like Macaulay none the less because his cock-sureness and loquacity
came dangerously near to making him a bore; Dr. Johnson grows in
interest when I learn that he found it a continual and almost hopeless
struggle to become an early riser, that he feared death, and could
drink tea as long as the housekeeper could brew it; that Tennyson was
a slave to tobacco and acted like a yokel when the newly-wedded
Muellers entertained him at breakfast does not detract from my
enjoyment of the exquisite pathos of _Tears, Idle Tears_; that the
marriage of the Brownings was a runaway romance is a whole commentary
of explanation when I read their poems of romantic love; that
Longfellow is said to have declined an invitation to the Adirondacks
because he was told that Emerson was to carry a gun is really far more
delightful, and I may add valuable, information than to know the exact
date of the birth of either.",1900-2000,26910
"Thanksgiving was but a week off, so the football team had to work

every morning, and this time was spent in the hardest kind of
practice with the ball.",1800-1900,5780

"The place of rendezvous for the triremes was at Elæus
of the Chersonesus, from whence detachments from the army were sent,
and by force of blows compelled to dig a passage through Mount Athos,
with orders to relieve each other at certain regular intervals. The
undertaking was assisted by those who inhabited the mountain, and the
conduct of the work was confided to Bubares, the son of Megabazus, and
Antachæus, son of Artæus, both of whom were Persians. [b]

This incident Richardson conceives to be utterly incredible. The
promontory was, as he justly remarks, no more than two hundred miles
from Athens, and yet Xerxes is said to have employed a number of men,
three years before his crossing the Hellespont, to separate it from the
continent, and make a canal for his shipping. Themistocles, also, who
from the time of the battle of Marathon had been incessantly alarming the
Athenians with another Persian invasion, never endeavoured to support his
opinion by any allusion to this canal, the very digging of which must
have filled all Greece with astonishment, and been the subject of every
public conversation.",1900-2000,55195
"And he said in that
of likelihood as he thought. Therevpon foorthwith they brought him
vnto the king his brother into the bishops palace at Paules, and from
thense thorough the citie honourablie into the Tower, out of the which
after that daie they neuer came abroad. (*) When the protector had
both the children in his hands, he opened himselfe more boldlie, both
to certeine other men, and also cheeflie to the duke of Buckingham.",1483-1600,45614
"West at once
dismissed this pedantry, and restored nature and propriety in his noble
work of ‘the Death of Wolfe.’ The multitude acknowledged its excellence
at once; the lovers of old art, the manufacturers of compositions,
called by courtesy classical, complained of the barbarism of boots and
buttons, and blunderbusses, and cried out for naked warriors, with bows,
bucklers, and battering rams. Lord Grosvenor, disregarding the frowns of
the amateurs, and the, at best, cold approbation of the Royal Academy,
purchased this work, which, in spite of laced coats and cocked hats, is
one of the best of our historical pictures. The Indian warrior watching
the dying hero to see if he equalled in fortitude the children of the
desert, is a fine stroke of nature and poetry.”

West, however, was plagued with misgivings as to his new doctrine; and
the dampers came forth in numbers with their unvarying, “It will never
do.” When it was understood that West actually intended to paint the
characters as they appeared on the scene, the Archbishop of York called
on Reynolds, and asked his opinion; they both called upon West to
dissuade him from running so great a risk.",1700-1800,50156
"We have printed in this book many letters from distinguished artists
expressing their satisfaction with our rendering of their drawings,
with one object--to place beyond all doubt that if wood engravings were
produced under the conditions named, the results would always prove
satisfactory. We have a letter before us from Sir Edward Burne-Jones, in which he
says: ""I was quite unprepared for such fidelity."" By the introduction of the various ""processes"" by which artists'
drawings are nowadays made applicable for reproduction, the days of
wood engraving are practically over, and we have to bow to the new
light which we had long felt would come; and we need hardly say that,
for the reproduction of good pen work, with the new process by line
etching, the results are perfect. Also, when we look at the reproductions of tint drawings by such
men as William Small, De Haenen, the Pagets, Caton Woodville, W. L.
and C. Wyllie, Edgar Bundy, Jacomb Hood, and many other artists of
distinction, by the half-tone process, and when we think (beyond all
this fine artistic work) of the vast mass of wonderful illustration
given to the public, week by week, of every conceivable class of
subject, direct from the camera, in which the draughtsman has no part
at all, and this work is generally of singular beauty and truth--we
feel that our occupation is gone.",1700-1800,48721
"They will so beset a man with
questions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him, that, without an
absurd silence, he must show an inclination one way; or if he do not,
they will gather as much by his silence, as by his speech. As for
equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they cannot hold out long. So
that no man can be secret, except he give himself a little scope of
dissimulation; which is, as it were, but the skirts or train of secrecy. But for the third degree, which is simulation, and false profession;
that I hold more culpable, and less politic; except it be in great and
rare matters.",1600-1700,575

you know my father kept a diary, Emily?’

‘I have seen him making little notes in various little books: but it is
so long ago.’

"); and yet it was rather a relief, too, for I had got almost shy
about passing him. It seemed so absurd to see the man every day and
never to speak; besides, I fancied, though of course it could only be
fancy, that he looked as if he was expecting me. At last I couldn't
help blushing, and I thought he saw it; for I'm sure he smiled, and

Orenoqueponi, and they promised to bring me to a mountain that had of
them very large pieces growing diamond-wise; whether it be crystal of
the mountain, Bristol diamond, or sapphire, I do not yet know, but
I hope the best; sure I am that the place is as likely as those from
whence all the rich stones are brought, and in the same height or very
near. On the left hand of this river Caroli are seated those nations
which I called Iwarawaqueri before remembered, which are enemies to the

Expression, when he mentions the Bomb Vessels being got near enough to
divert the Town; for in Truth they were posted at so great a Distance,
that they seem'd to be sent in with no other Intention. That the City of _Carthagena_ is to the Land-side, fortify'd by double
Walls, and double Ditches, flank'd by strong Bastions, is an undoubted
Truth; but I must dissent from what the Author alledges, of the Water at
the Head of the Harbour, being shoal so far off, that Ships cannot come
near enough to do Execution with their Guns. Experienced Pilots, and
Masters of trading Vessels, who have been much conversant in that
Harbour, do (and will when Occasion requires it) testify the contrary;
but nothing can be a stronger Proof of there being sufficient depth of
Water for our largest Ships, than that the Station of the _Spanish_
Galleons, is very near the Walls, for the Convenience of taking in their
Lading. It is well known, that Monsieur _Ponti_ sent in his Men of War

aflush with the hillside, are better adapted to resist the intense cold

Asia Minor and South America, that they return at once to the primitive
stock from which they were bred. But the first answer that you make to

Nietzsche says: ""With regard to German music I consider precaution
necessary in various ways. Assuming that a person loves the South (as I
love it) as a great training-school for health of soul and sense in
their highest potency, as an uncontrollable flood and glamour of
sunshine spreading over a race of independent and self-reliant
beings;--well, such an one will learn to be more or less on his guard
against German music, because, while spoiling his taste anew, it
undermines his health. ""Such a Southlander (not by descent, but by belief) must, should he
dream of the future of music, likewise dream of a redemption of music
from the North, while in his ears there rings the prelude to a deeper,
mightier, perchance a more evil and more mysterious music, a
super-German music, which does not fade, wither and die away in view of
the blue, sensuous sea and the splendor of Mediterranean skies, as all
German music does;--a super-European music, that asserts itself even
amid the tawny sunsets of the desert, whose soul is allied with the
palm-tree, and can consort and prowl with great, beautiful, lonely
beasts of prey. ""I could imagine a music whose rarest charm should consist in its
complete divorce from the Good and the Bad;--only that its surface might
be ruffled, as it were, by a longing as of a sailor for home, by
variable golden shadows and tender frailties:--an Art which should see
fleeing toward it, from afar off, the hues of a perishing moral world
become wellnigh incomprehensible, and which should be hospitable and
profound enough to harbor such belated fugitives.""",1900-2000,31799

bonniest broom when seen early in June, commanding, moreover, a ravishing
prospect. The refreshment-room of a conservatory type will tempt one to linger over
the lemonade, certain to be demanded by the thirsting soul as a due
reward at the finish of the climb, and which the pleasant toil renders
unusually nectareous, the relish being chiefly due, without doubt, to the
slight sudorific exertion, the most stimulative and wholesome condiment
for food, and, as experience satisfactorily proves, for drinks too. Horace, “always up to date,” advises well “pulmentaria quære sudando.”

A story has been for many years current, that an eccentric gentleman, of
some scientific aspirations, residing on Long Island, not a thousand
miles from New York, once induced a thick-set and very green Hibernian
to ascend a very remarkably high and spreading tree, near his residence,
accompanied by a curious nondescript flying-machine, by the aid of which
he was to soar off, and float very softly down upon the bosom of mother
Earth! All being ready, the aeronaut started from a platform which had
been built in the topmost branches. He ""_slode_"" over the branches, and
then ""toppled down headlong"" to the ground, covered with the wrecks of
his scientific master's flying-machine, and making another wreck of
himself. He ""heard something drop,"" and it was a foolish Irishman!",1800-1900,38952
"They
had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they
saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins
and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter
oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along
with them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome
travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the
other which way each party was going, they learned that all were bound
for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.",1600-1700,5906

combines not only with inorganic bases to form salts, but with alcohols
to form esters. In the middle of the 19th century, Theophile Juste
Pelouze (1807-1867) extended this knowledge to an ester of glycerol. This proved to be significant in several respects. Glycerol had been
shown by Michel Chevreul (1786-1889) as the substance in fats that is
released in the process of soap boiling, when the fatty acids are
converted into their salts.",1600-1700,33766

characters, and behaviour in their stations; and finding most of them
had behaved well to the government they had lived under (for their
plea was, they had found things under a usurpation, and being so, that
government was natural to them, having singly no power to alter it);

at work when the fact was communicated to him, which being done, he fell
to the ground, as though the intelligence had struck him dead; and when
he recovered from the swoon, he raved, frantic. He wandered to Madrid,

English history. In the year 1835 a great storm shifted the sand and
exposed the minute archaic edifice where tradition had placed it, and
where it had been hidden for we cannot say how many centuries. A tradition came down from Druidical to recent times to the effect that

the Deity, as misrepresented by Calvinism, both unsettles all our

Goodness. That the mental disease of Cowper was intensely aggravated by
depressing views of the divine character, which he received from
Newton and others, and that the consolations which might have

two or three times the word 'misses,' to put them in mind, that she

distinct curtsey to every one in the room, that she might be the

"But the Romans, who were practical and logical to the extreme,
who reduced magic to a system whereby they regulated their daily life,
consistently enough also utilised sympathetic magic as a legal instrument. For it would be a great mistake to infer from the ridicule poured by Cicero
(_Pro Murena_, xii. 62) on the fictions of Roman law, that those symbolisms
were puerile mummeries designed to benefit the legal profession at the
expense of its clients. The clod of earth which was brought into court was
no mere symbol, but gave to those who held it exactly the same control over
the estate from which it came, as the image of a god gives to its
possessor, or as the hair or clothing of a person who is to be bewitched
gives to the worker of the spell. A form of sympathetic magic which is practised by agricultural peoples all
over the world is a ""sacred marriage,"" whereby two spirits or their images,
or their living representatives, are united, in order that their union may
be sympathetically followed by fertility in flock and field.",1600-1700,57513

especially in the accompaniment passage, which renders so marvellously
the agitation of the situation. [47] It may at first sight appear

"It does not sit well on a man only because of its
being common to animals with him; it augurs in him the lack of true and
perfect humanity. It only shocks us in the poem because such a work
having the pretension to please us, the author consequently seems to
think us capable, us also, of this moral infirmity. But when we see in
the man who has let himself be drawn into it by surprise all the other
characteristics that human nature in general embraces; when we find in
the work where these liberties have been taken the expression of all the
realities of human nature, this motive of discontent disappears, and we
can enjoy, without anything changing our joy, this simple expression of a
true and beautiful nature. Consequently this same poet who ventures to
allow himself to associate us with feelings so basely human, ought to
know, on the other hand, how to raise us to all that is grand, beautiful,
and sublime in our nature. We should, therefore, have found there a measure to which we could
subject the poet with confidence, when he trespasses on the ground of
decency, and when he does not fear to penetrate as far as that in order
freely to paint nature.",1900-2000,6798

"""I hesitate,"" said Don Quixote, ""because it is not lawful for me to draw
sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire Sancho to
me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business."" Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively
exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord
and to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were
furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard
treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let us
leave him there; for he will surely find some one to help him, and if
not, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his
strength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what Don
Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him privately as
to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed. To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart was
troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made
answer:

""Senor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,
through heaven's will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Dona
Clara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the
mistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no
impediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my

"Zoraida, though she did not fully comprehend
all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing why, as she watched and
studied the various countenances, but particularly her Spaniard's, whom
she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul. The gift and
compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the
landlord's notice, and he demanded Don Quixote's reckoning, together with
the amount of the damage to his wine-skins, and the loss of his wine,
swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho's ass should leave the inn
until he had been paid to the very last farthing. The curate settled all
amicably, and Don Fernando paid; though the Judge had also very readily
offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the
inn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don
Quixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of
Octavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks
were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to the
unexampled generosity of Don Fernando. Finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as well
as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue
the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great adventure for
which he had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he went
and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not allow him to utter a
word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose, and said, ""It is a
common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the mother of good
fortune,' and experience has often shown in important affairs that the
earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful
termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than
in war, where quickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy,
and win the victory before the foe has time to defend himself. All this I
say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to
remain any longer in this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to
us in a way that we shall find out some day; for who knows but that your
enemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies
that I am going to destroy him, and if the opportunity be given him he
may seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold,

"The Buccaneers had with them the Sloop which they first sent to us for our
Intelligence, and which they made a little Fregate of, carrying eight Guns,
and some Patareroes: They had not long Time to consult, but in short they
resolv'd to double man the Sloop, and let her attack the great
Merchant-Ship, while the Fregate, which was the whole of their Fleet, held
the Man of War in Play, or at least kept him from assisting her. According to this Resolution, they put 50 Men on Board the Sloop, which
was, in short, almost as many as would stand upon her Deck one by another;
and with this Force they attack'd the great Merchant-Ship, which, besides
its being well mann'd, had 16 good Guns, and about 30 Men on Board. While
the Sloop thus began the unequal Fight, the Man of War bore down upon her
to succour the Ship under her Convoy, but the Fregate thrusting in between,
engag'd the Man of War, and began a very warm Fight with her, for the Man
of War had both more Guns and more Men than the Fregate after she had
parted with 50 Men on Board the Sloop: While the two Men of War, as we may
now call them, were thus engag'd, the Sloop was in great Danger of being
worsted by the Merchant-Ship, for the Force was too much for her, the Ship
was great, and her Men fought a desperate and close Fight: Twice the
Sloop-Men enter'd her, and were beaten off, and about nine of their Men
kill'd, several other wounded, and an unlucky Shot taking the Sloop between
Wind and Water, she was oblig'd to fall a-Stern, and heel her over to stop
the Leek; during which the _Spaniards_ steer'd away to assist the Man of
War, and pour'd her Broadside in upon the Fregate, which tho' but small,
yet at a Time when she lay Yard-arm and Yard-arm close by the Side of the
_Spanish_ Man of War, was a great Extremity; however, the Fregate return'd
her Broadside, and therewith made her sheer off, and, which was worse, shot
her Main-mast thro', tho' it did not come presently by the Board. During this Time, the Sloop having many Hands, had stopp'd the Leak, was
brought to rights again, and came up again to the Engagement, and at the
first Broadside had the good Luck to bring the Ship's Foremast by the
Board, and thereby disabled her; but could not for all that lay her
athwart, or carry her by Boarding, so that the Case began to be very
doubtful; at which, the Captain of the Sloop, finding the Merchant Ship was
disabled, and could not get away from them, resolv'd to leave her a while
and assist the Fregate; which he did, and running a Longside our Fregate,
he fairly laid the Man of War on Board just thwart his Hawser; and besides
firing into her with his great Shot, he very fairly set her on Fire; and it
was a great Chance but that they had been all three burnt together, but our
Men helpt the _Spaniards_ themselves to put out the Fire, and after some
Time master'd it: But the _Spaniards_ were in such a terrible Fright at the
Apprehension of the Fire, that they made little Resistance afterwards, and
in short, in about an Hour's Fight more, the _Spanish_ Man of War struck,
and was taken; and after that the Merchant Ship also, with all the Wealth
that was in her: And thus their Victory was as compleat as it was
unexpected. The Captain of the _Spanish_ Man of War was kill'd in the Fight, and about
36 of his Men, and most of the rest wounded, which it seems happen'd upon
the Sloop's lying athwart her.",1700-1800,37992

possibility of a doubt. --But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all December, January, and
February?--Why, Madam,--he was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica. Chapter 1.V. On the fifth day of November, 1718, which to the aera fixed on, was
as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have
expected,--was I Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, brought forth into this
scurvy and disastrous world of ours.--I wish I had been born in the
Moon, or in any of the planets, (except Jupiter or Saturn, because I
never could bear cold weather) for it could not well have fared worse
with me in any of them (though I will not answer for Venus) than it
has in this vile, dirty planet of ours,--which, o' my conscience, with
reverence be it spoken, I take to be made up of the shreds and clippings
of the rest;--not but the planet is well enough, provided a man could
be born in it to a great title or to a great estate; or could any how
contrive to be called up to public charges, and employments of dignity
or power;--but that is not my case;--and therefore every man will speak
of the fair as his own market has gone in it;--for which cause I affirm
it over again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made;--for I
can truly say, that from the first hour I drew my breath in it, to this,
that I can now scarce draw it at all, for an asthma I got in scating
against the wind in Flanders;--I have been the continual sport of what
the world calls Fortune; and though I will not wrong her by saying, She
has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evil;--yet with
all the good temper in the world I affirm it of her, that in every stage
of my life, and at every turn and corner where she could get fairly
at me, the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful
misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero sustained. Chapter 1.VI.",1700-1800,1079
"The Husband
endeavor'd to pacify his dear Spouse, and made her sensible of the
Situation in which she kept us; upon which, without making the least
Compliment, she sate down at the Table, and I thought the Rage of the
Storm was over; but far from it, she was no sooner seated than she began
again to rave with more Fury than before. A Lackey, to whom, it seems,
all this Bawling was more distasteful than it was to us, thought fit to
tell her very bluntly, _That she made a great Noise for nothing_. Then the
Lady was quite outragious, and went to give the Lackey a Blow with all the
Weight of her Arm; but the Droll cunningly parry'd it, by receiving the
Stroke upon a Plate he had in his Hand; which, as he manag'd it, serv'd
him for a Shield. The Gentlewoman gave herself such a terrible Blow, that
for one while she could not speak; and when she came to her self, she made
a worse Racket than before.",1700-1800,38507
"It will presently be necessary to
notice their first appearance in the field. As to the general organisation of the army, the whole was divided
into thousands under an officer called a millenar, subdivided
into hundreds, each under a centenar, and further subdivided
into twenties, each under a vintenar. The commander-in-chief was
usually the King in person, aided by two principal officers,
the High Constable and the Marshal, whose duties were, roughly
speaking, those of Adjutant and Quartermaster-General. For tactical
purposes the army was distributed into three divisions, called the
vanguard, battle and rearguard, which kept those names whatever
their position in the field or on the march, whether the host was
drawn up, as most commonly, in three lines, or in one.",1700-1800,55968
"Both in size and form
considerable variability is displayed, the species of _Holochilus_ being
some of the largest, while the common white-footed mouse (_Eligmodon
leucopus_) of North America is one of the smaller forms. Some kinds,
such as _Oryzomys_ and _Peromyscus_ have long, rat-like tails, while
others, like _Acodon_, are short-tailed and more vole-like in
appearance. In habits some are partially arboreal, others wholly
terrestrial, and a few more or less aquatic. Among the latter, the most
remarkable are the fish-eating rats (_Ichthyomys_) of North-western
South America, which frequent streams and feed on small fish. The
Florida rice-rat (_Sigmodon hispidus_) is another well-known
representative of the group.",1700-1800,38454
"To the northeast the despot of the
Cossacks planted one foot upon Poland, another upon Hungary, smothered
both countries in their own blood, and now threatens the independence of
Europe with his knout, and is even ready to hurl upon us his savage
hordes!"" ""Similar hordes, my children, our wooden-shoed fathers rolled in the
dust in the days of the Convention--we shall do as much. As to the
Kings, they massacre, they threaten, they foam at the mouth with
rage--and, above all, with terror! Already they see myriads of avengers
arise out of the blood of the martyrs whom they assassinated. These
crown-carriers have the vertigo.",1900-2000,37225
"This I suppose to have
been silver, as he told me the horses were shod with it, and that their
bridles were ornamented with the same. When they had satiated their
revenge, they carried off their spoil, and being got so far as to be out
of the reach of the Spaniards that had escaped their fury, they left the
useless and ponderous burthen, with which the horses were loaded, in the
woods, and mounting themselves, in this manner returned to their
friends. The party they had thus defeated, I conclude to be the caravan
that annually conveys to Mexico, the silver which the Spaniards find in
great quantities on the mountains lying near the heads of the Coloredo
River: and the plains where the attack was made, probably, some they
were obliged to pass over in their way to the heads of the River St.
Fee, or Rio del Nord, which falls into the Gulph of Mexico to the west
of the Mississippi. The Winnebagoes can raise about two hundred warriors. Their town
contains about fifty houses, which are strongly built with palisades,
and the island on which it is situated nearly fifty acres.",1700-1800,49753
"The Snake, or Lewis' Fork of the Columbia, as it is
sometimes called, altogether is a right noble stream--by far the
largest in all that region--and it seemed would yet be made available
for navigation, though now badly beset with reefs and rapids. A
steamboat had already been built at Farewell Bend, to run up to the
neighborhood of Boise and beyond; but that was her first season,
and the results were yet to be seen. It was said, that by starting
early in the season, she could reach a point within about two hundred
miles of Salt Lake, and thus communicate with a vast region there,
then comparatively isolated. A fine vein of good bituminous coal had
just been opened in the overhanging bluff at Farewell Bend, and here
was fuel cheap for all the country up the Snake. Below Farewell Bend
there were rapids that would have to be circumvented by slack-water
navigation or railroad portages, the same as on the Columbia.",1800-1900,42706

"Immediately after our meal I was going after him, but before it was
finished he came, without his camel, and said he could not get her on,
so had tied her up to a tree and walked back, he having gone a long
way on my old tracks. I sent Tommy and another riding-camel with him,
and in a couple of hours they returned with Mr. Young's animal. The following morning, the 17th, much to my distress, one of our young
bull camels was found to be poisoned, and could not move.",1800-1900,4974
"The armies were too small,
and had too little durability, to be able to control by regular
strategic operations, the numerous and warlike people of wide-spread
districts. Whilst a victorious army was ruling near the Rhine or the
Oder, a new enemy was collecting in the north on the shores of the
Baltic. The German theatre of war, also, was not so constituted as to
be easily productive of lasting results. Almost every city, and many
country seats were fortified. The siege guns were still unwieldy and
uncertain in their aim, and the defence of fortified places was
proportionably stronger than the attack.",1483-1600,33795
"She understood what belonged to a princess, and took state upon
her rather too much.”

The next personage of importance at court was Mrs. Palmer, afterwards
Countess of Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland, who figures so
largely in the “Diary.” It is greatly to the credit of Lords Clarendon
and Southampton that they would have nothing to do with the King’s
favourite. Burnet tells us that the former would let nothing pass the
Great Seal in which she was named, and the latter would never suffer
her name to appear in the Treasury books. The King usually held a court
at his mistress’s lodgings before going to church, and his ministers
made their applications there, but Clarendon and Southampton were never
to be seen in her rooms.",1700-1800,51757

"For when the soul has been cleansed by faith and made to
love God, it would have all things to be cleansed in like manner, and
especially its own body, so that all things might unite with it in the
love and praise of God. Thus it comes that, from the requirements of his
own body, a man cannot take his ease, but is compelled on its account
to do many good works, that he may bring it into subjection. Yet these
works are not the means of his justification before God; he does them
out of disinterested love to the service of God; looking to no other
end than to do what is well-pleasing to Him whom he desires to obey most
dutifully in all things.",1483-1600,1911

intimated that there remained only enough of this emotion to prevent
her heart from straying elsewhere and that this remnant, together with
her wifely virtue made it impossible for her to respond, except with a
rebuff, to any possible suitor. The Comte who recognised her sincerity and who saw in her a character
wholly opposed to flirtation and gallantry, did not doubt the truth of
her words; but nevertheless he was unable to resist all the charms

"XXVII.--_Observations upon Malic Acid, and its Combinations with
the Salifiable Bases[45]._

The malic acid exists ready formed in the sour juice of ripe and unripe
apples, and many other fruits, and is obtained as follows: Saturate the
juice of apples with potash or soda, and add a proper proportion of
acetite of lead dissolved in water; a double decomposition takes place,
the malic acid combines with the oxyd of lead and precipitates, being
almost insoluble, and the acetite of potash or soda remains in the
liquor. The malat of lead being separated by decantation, is washed with
cold water, and some dilute sulphuric acid is added; this unites with
the lead into an insoluble sulphat, and the malic acid remains free in
the liquor. This acid, which is found mixed with citric and tartarous acid in a
great number of fruits, is a kind of medium between oxalic and acetous
acids being more oxygenated than the former, and less so than the
latter. From this circumstance, Mr Hermbstadt calls it _imperfect
vinegar_; but it differs likewise from acetous acid, by having rather
more charcoal, and less hydrogen, in the composition of its radical.",1700-1800,30775

"Their
desperation was completed by the interpretation which the common
people gave to everything--irresponsible soldiers, with mestizos,
mulattoes, and blacks, telling the Sangleys that they were to
have their heads cut off, as if they were men already sentenced to
death; and inflicting on them many injuries and uttering a thousand
insults. Such circumstances as these concurring in the insurrection
of the year 1603 necessarily caused it, as Doctor Morga observes;
and on this occasion their fear of the like proceedings led them
to a similar desperation. They heard that the twenty-fifth day of
May was to be that of their destruction, because the cavalry troops
were to arrive on the day before. Some of them--the most worthless
class, as butchers and vegetable-sellers--began to talk of extricating
themselves from he danger; but those in the Parian displayed no courage
for any measures, for, as their interests are so involved in peace,
they never have incurred the hazard of war except under compulsion.",1600-1700,30350

the trade between them and Great Britain was renewed on the most liberal
footing. The parliament, by repealing this act, so obnoxious to their American
brethren, did not intend to lay aside the scheme of raising a revenue in
the colonies, but merely to change the mode. Accordingly the next year,
they passed an act, laying a certain duty on glass, tea, paper, and

THE HOMEMAKER

The wife brings us to another aspect of the home, though it cannot be
too often repeated that all aspects are so inextricably interwoven that
they must be considered together. When the wife takes the means
provided, the raw material from which a home is to be made, she engages
in a very complicated form of manufacture, including in its processes
the buying, preparation, and serving of food, the care of the household
possessions, the buying, making, and care of clothing, the training of
children, and many minor departments. These are only processes,
however, and, unless the maker have an ideal picture in her mind of
what a home should be, neither some nor all of these processes will
make a home.",1900-2000,24841

requires no additional heat to raise it to a proper temperature. After
the curd is cut into small squares, the whey is carefully drained off
through a hair strainer. The cutting is repeated every thirty minutes
till the whey is removed, when it is put into vats and covered with dry
cloths, and placed in the press. After remaining a sufficient length of
time, it is put into a curd-mill and cut or ground into small pieces,

Tree they were saw’d out of, must naturally remain in them. The like may

Non-electricables, never had their Existence from Nature only; and
therefore they are quite of a different Tribe. For what I say is, That
whatever had once Fire in it is capable of being electrify’d. Those
called Electrics _per se_, having no Fire in them, when, by Friction,
Fire is collected on their Surfaces, it is either driven from thence
into the Air, or into some Electricable, and so it joins with that Fire
which naturally belongs to it. Sealing-wax is compounded of Non-electricables, and, if you rub it, will
attract Things to it as Amber will: And I believe all other Things,

"It is necessary to remember, that an _universal Relaxation_ must be the
Consequence of a Conflict of the whole Mechanism; and from these several
Evacuations in so small a Space, the human Frame must be weakened, by
her Endeavours to extricate herself from the deleterious Effects of this
Poison. This Inconvenience is easily repairable, by persevering in the
Use of _cordial and bracing Medicines_, which should likewise be
continued some Days, to bring the Frame to its pristine State; the
Patient must live upon light, but good Nutriment, drink after Meals, in
Moderation, of generous Wine, and avoid Sauces with Butter, that all
Danger of nervous Tremors, and Loss of Appetite, may be, as much as
possible, prevented; but if such should happen to be the Consequence,
the Tincture of the _Peruvian_ Bark, with Elixir of Vitriol, in small
Doses, will certainly remove them. As I have condemned the Use of Alkalious Medicines, by endeavouring to
prove the Impropriety of them, and as the great _Mead_ has mentioned
them indefinitely, it may be proper to examine their Antithesis, or
contrary Principle of Acids, the Use of which, as Sudorifics and
Bracers, to compleat the Cure, are indispensably necessary. As we find, upon the Examination of Opium, by chemical Analysis, that it
contains a very large Proportion of a volatile Salt, and corrosive Oil,
Alkalies will undoubtedly encrease the Volatility of the one, and
Corrosivity of the other, and thereby assist their Expansion. On the
other Hand, Acids condense Volatiles, and destroy their Power; and
furthermore, will prevent the Expansion of the corrosive Oil, by
checking the Activity of the Salts.",1700-1800,52541

ourselves, and see what Use is to be made of them:

_Use 1._ Is it so, that God seeth a proneness in all the sons of
_Adam_, to seek themselves too much, and hath given them warnings
and watch-words thereof, as we have heard, and doth experience
confirm it? Then hence are reproved a number of men, who think
they can never shew love enough to themselves, nor seek their own
enough, but think all cost, charges, cherishing, praise, honor,
&c. too little for them, and no man needeth to say to them, as
_Peter_ did to Christ, _favor thy self_; but if they do a little
for another man, they account it a great matter, though it be but
a morsel of bread, or a single penny; but no varieties of dainties
is too good for them, no silk, purple, cloth, or stuff is too
good to clothe them, the poor man's idleness and ill husbandry is
oft thrown in his dish, but their own carnal delights and fleshy
wantonness is never thought upon: and why? Because they think even
God and man owes all to them, but they owe nothing to none. Why,
thou foolish and besotted man, hath not the Holy Ghost read it in
the very face of every son of _Adam_, that he is too apt to seek
his own, and art thou wiser than God, to think thou never seekest
thine own enough?",1700-1800,44071

"In the subsequent reasonings on this
subject, we shall argue against supernatural revelation in general,
which will comprehend the doctrine of inspiration or immediate
illumination of the mind. And first--we will premise, that a revelation
consists of an assemblage of rational ideas, intelligibly arranged
and understood by those to whom it may be supposed to be revealed,
for otherwise it could not exist in their minds as such. To suppose a
revelation, void of rationality or understanding, or of communicating
rational intelligence to those, to whom it maybe supposed to be given,
would be a contradiction; for that it could contain nothing except it
were unintelligibleness which would be the same as to reveal and not
to reveal; therefore, a revelation must consist of an assemblage of
rational ideas, intelligibly communicated to those who are supposed
to have been the partakers or receivers of it from the first supposed
inspiration, down to this or any other period of time.",1700-1800,37694

"5, 7). He then who does not wish to go astray, with these blind ones, must look
further than to the works of the law or the doctrine of works; nay,
must turn away his sight from works, and look to the person, and to the
manner in which it may be justified. Now it is justified and saved, not
by works or laws, but by the word of God--that is, by the promise of His
grace--so that the glory may be to the Divine majesty, which has saved
us who believe, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to His mercy, by the word of His grace. From all this it is easy to perceive on what principle good works are
to be cast aside or embraced, and by what rule all teachings put forth
concerning works are to be understood. For if works are brought forward
as grounds of justification, and are done under the false persuasion
that we can pretend to be justified by them, they lay on us the yoke
of necessity, and extinguish liberty along with faith, and by this very
addition to their use they become no longer good, but really worthy of

causing a fracture indicates that the velocity of shrapnel balls is,
sometimes at least, very low and that this low velocity may occur at
a comparatively short range from the point where the shrapnel balls
are discharged from the chamber or near the apex of the “cone of

been so widely dispersed as when they arrive at the base of the “cone

"But of Confession they teach that an enumeration of sins is not
necessary, and that consciences be not burdened with anxiety to
enumerate all sins, for it is impossible to recount all sins, as the
Psalm testifies, 19,13: Who can understand his errors? Also Jeremiah,
17 9: The heart is deceitful; who can know it; But if no sins were
forgiven, except those that are recounted, consciences could never find
peace; for very many sins they neither see nor can remember. The ancient
writers also testify that an enumeration is not necessary. For in the
Decrees, Chrysostom is quoted, who says thus: I say not to you that you
should disclose yourself in public, nor that you accuse yourself before
others, but I would have you obey the prophet who says: ""Disclose thy
self before God.""",1483-1600,275

"From no quarter can a child receive religious instruction with more
benefit than from a _mother_; and in proportion to the ignorance or
indiscretion of the latter, will be that of the former. If a child is
unaccustomed to see books of religion in her mother's library, she
can have but little curiosity to peruse them; and if they at last
be obtruded on her, she will naturally suspect the sincerity of her
instructor, who produces works which she deems of the highest importance
to her pupil's welfare, but of which she herself does not possess a
single copy. This evil is easily remedied, if parents would only
consider the importance of religious education; if, instead of crowding
their shelves with the flimsy productions of novelists and romancers,
they would admit a few judicious works, which treat of the evidences of
the Christian religion, and describe the chief doctrines by which it is
upheld. A portion of these studies might be given at stated times, or as
the inclination of the child prompts, so as not to make them too formal
or severe. By the blessing of providence, we have, in our own country, a great
abundance of excellent religious tracts, which display the rise,

indicates the direction taken by our planet; therefore we must be able
to find this type _at the equator_. Either it is there, or it is nowhere
else, and it is indispensably necessary that astronomical observations
made elsewhere should be repeated at the equator thus as it were
confirmed. The erection of small, simple and detached observations along the line
of the earth's equator, at certain distances from each other, and the
subdivision of the work amongst the various observers, according the

the place where it was inserted; as I am always sure to find infection
there if the disease succeeds, and always of sufficient energy. It may appear strange that no bandage, dressing, or application
whatsoever, is made use of to the part infected; but that the most
simple incision being made, and moistened with the smallest particle of
the recent fluid matter, the whole is committed to nature. This method
is however perfectly right, because the application of either plaister
or unguent, as is the usual practice, will occasion an inflammation on
some skins, and in all tend to disguise the natural appearance of the
incision, and prevent our forming a proper judgment of the progress
of the infection; which will afterwards appear to be a matter of much
importance. If neither an inoculated patient is at hand, nor any one in the
neighbourhood has a distinct kind of the natural disease, a thread may
be used as in the common manner, provided the thread be very recently
infected; but I think it ought to be used as soon as possible after
being charged with infecting matter. The following method of introducing the disease has likewise been

"The writers, who in this second moiety of the sixteenth century
appear to have been most conspicuous for purity of style, were Muretus,
Paulus Manutius Perpinianus, Osorius, Maphæus, to whom we may add our
own Buchanan, and perhaps Haddon. The first of these is celebrated for
his Orations, published by Aldus Manutius in 1576. Many of these were
delivered a good deal earlier. Ruhnkenius, editor of the works of
Muretus, says that he at once eclipsed Bembo, Sadolet, and the whole
host of Ciceronians; expressing himself so perfectly in that author’s
style that we should fancy ourselves to be reading him, did not the
subject betray a modern hand. “In learning,” he says, “and in knowledge
of the Latin language, Manutius was not inferior to Muretus; we may even
say, that his zeal in imitating Cicero was still stronger, inasmuch as
he seemed to have no other aim all his life than to bear a perfect
resemblance to that model.",1800-1900,43868
"To these indirect presumptions that our sensations, following the
mutations of our capacity for feeling, are always undergoing an
essential change, must be added another presumption, based on what
must happen in the brain. Every sensation corresponds to some cerebral
action. For an identical sensation to recur it would have to occur the
second time _in an unmodified brain_. But as this, strictly speaking,
is a physiological impossibility, so is an unmodified feeling an
impossibility; for to every brain-modification, however small, must
correspond a change of equal amount in the feeling which the brain
subserves.",1900-2000,57628

said, thou hast compassion on a wild vine, whereon thou bestowedest no

United States a power to levy a duty of 5 per cent on all goods imported
from foreign countries into the United States for the term of fifteen
years. In 1783 this recommendation, with alterations as to the kind of
duties and an extension of this term to twenty-five years, was repeated
and more earnestly urged. In 1784 it was recommended to the States
to authorize Congress to prohibit, under certain modifications, the
importation of goods from foreign powers into the United States for
fifteen years. In 1785 the consideration of the subject was resumed,

to regulate trade was deemed indispensable.",1800-1900,10919

gaunt peasant wrapped in a mantle. He was a stranger, and plainly did
not know me even by repute; for, instead of keeping the other side, he
drew near and sat down beside me, and we had soon fallen in talk. Among

As compared with the sober and temperate style of official
correspondence in the present day, when a civilly expressed request is
generally held to convey all the force of a direct command, Whitley's

with some of the postmasters at neighbouring post stages, by sending
travellers bound for Scotland by the road through Owler (Wooler)

Whitley's letters to Mr. Pye is as follows:--""I understand you well and
your designs, but you shall not prevail with me (for all your specious
arguments or applications to great persons) to countenance you in your

extraordinary in his journey to Brundusium, and his account of his bad
dinner; nor in his dirty low quarrel between one Rupilius, whose words,
as he expresses it, were full of poisonous filth; and another, whose
language was dipped in vinegar. His indelicate verses against old women
and witches have frequently given me great offense; nor can I discover
the great merit of his telling his friend Mecaenas, that if he will but

was only an effect of an over-scrupulous modesty, told her that Mr.
Glanville had committed no offence by saluting her, since that was a
civility which was granted to all strangers at the first interview, and
therefore could not be refused to a relation. Since the world is so degenerated in its customs from what it was

beseech you, how I must behave to please you; for I should be extremely
glad to be honoured with your good opinion. The person, resumed she, whom I must teach how to acquire my good
opinion, will, I am afraid, hardly recompense me by his docility in

time for curing; an attention to the first appearances of the disorder

overthrown: but when that happy period has been neglected, he must wait
the effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing
matter gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but
sometimes dangerous, to attempt its expulsion from the body. The blood easily separates itself into the grosser and the thinner
parts: we see this in bleeding; and from the toughness of the red cake
may guess how very difficult it will be to dissolve a substance of like
firmness in the vessels of the body. That it can thus become thickened

this was the case I was informed by the commanding officer of the
Cristobal Colon. It was ascertained with fair conclusiveness that the Merrimac, so
gallantly taken into the channel on June 3, did not obstruct it. I
therefore maintained the blockade as follows:

To the battleships was assigned the duty, in turn, of lighting the
channel. Moving up to the port at a distance of from one to two

"Celtic pottery was found in 1862 by Captain Brome on Windmill
Hill at Gibraltar, in 1866 by M. Lartet in the caves of Torrecilla de
Cameros, and by Casiano de Prado in a cave near Pedraza, as well as at
Navares de Ayuso and elsewhere. In central Spain, vessels of the
Celtiberian era have been found in tombs at Pradena, and pieces of red
Saguntine ware, with dark red decoration, at Otero de Herreros, close to
vestiges of a Roman mine. Lecea y Garcia describes in his work on _Old
Segovian Industries_ a Celtiberian plate of reddish clay covered with
black varnish, which was dug up some years ago in a garden at that town. This plate, measuring no less than four feet in diameter, and containing
two inscriptions in characters believed to be Celtiberian, as well as
the figure of a warrior armed with a lance and three javelins, was
submitted to Heiss, who wrote of it in the _Gazette Archeologique_ and
pronounced it to be genuine. I have not seen the plate in question.",1900-2000,44392

"The foregoing reflections upon the progress of chemical ideas naturally
apply to the words by which these ideas are to be expressed. Guided by
the work which, in the year 1787, Messrs de Morveau, Berthollet, de
Fourcroy, and I composed upon the Nomenclature of Chemistry, I have
endeavoured, as much as possible, to denominate simple bodies by simple
terms, and I was naturally led to name these first. It will be
recollected, that we were obliged to retain that name of any substance
by which it had been long known in the world, and that in two cases only
we took the liberty of making alterations; first, in the case of those
which were but newly discovered, and had not yet obtained names, or at
least which had been known but for a short time, and the names of which
had not yet received the sanction of the public; and, secondly, when the
names which had been adopted, whether by the ancients or the moderns,
appeared to us to express evidently false ideas, when they confounded
the substances, to which they were applied, with others possessed of
different, or perhaps opposite qualities. We made no scruple, in this
case, of substituting other names in their room, and the greatest number
of these were borrowed from the Greek language. We endeavoured to frame
them in such a manner as to express the most general and the most
characteristic quality of the substances; and this was attended with the
additional advantage both of assisting the memory of beginners, who find
it difficult to remember a new word which has no meaning, and of
accustoming them early to admit no word without connecting with it some
determinate idea.",1700-1800,30775

"This latter
    class of monks was confined to the boundary wall, except that on
    some particular days the members of it were allowed to walk in
    parties beyond it, for exercise and amusement; but they were very
    seldom permitted either to receive or pay visits. Much of these
    rigorous observances was mitigated by a bull of Pope Sixtus IV.,
    in the year 1485, when among other indulgencies the whole order
    was allowed to eat flesh three times in every week; for which
    purpose a particular dining-room, separate and distinct from the
    usual refectory, was fitted up in every monastery. They were

"The other method in ordinary use among grainers is to do the work
wholly in distemper, and for work that is not too complicated this
method is undoubtedly the best. The mode of procedure is much the same
as for oil color, using the sponge to make the lighter parts, and
darkening the work with the sash tool, making the settled places
preparatory to overgraining. If done in this manner, the work will be
gone over two or three times in an hour, which is quite an advantage,
as, if the work is first done in oil, it must be allowed time to dry
before being shaded; but for intricate work the grain may be done
equally well in oil color if it is overgrained when dry. This wood is not of sufficient size to be used on large surfaces
without being jointed; hence it is not in good taste to imitate it on a
very large scale. Its use is more properly confined to small panels and
to interior rather than to exterior work.",1700-1800,41749

"And were not they
the finite effects of his infinite love and kindness? I have daily
experienced that the instrument was, and is, what God makes it to be; and
I know that this 'God hath the hearts of all men in his hands, and the

me, I shall have it; for my Father hath it all in possession.",1700-1800,11253

"My sister takes pleasure in your company;
indeed, the Marquise is charmed to be able to entertain three such
distinguished guests, and begs to place her chateau at your disposal
until such time as your own shall be restored. We shall speak of you to
the King, and he will certainly endeavour to induce King Charles, his
cousin, to recall you to your native country."" Then, after saying one or two words to me in private, he bowed to the
gentlemen and withdrew.",1700-1800,3849

that he had command of it. This interweaving of the instinctive reactions of the body with
conscious life is of the greatest practical significance. However well
adapted the inherited reflexes may be to the purpose of keeping the
young animal alive, they are very insufficient in meeting the ever
growing complications of life. And they are not perfect even in the
beginning. A reflex is the response to a present and direct impression
upon the organism; but very similar impressions may come from things of
different properties.",1900-2000,52823

"xxxii.,
and, in fact, all those propositions in which I have shown, that
everything in nature  proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with
the utmost perfection. However, I will add a  few remarks in
order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly. That
which is  really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice
versa:  it makes that which is by nature  first to be last, and
that which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect. Passing  over the questions of cause and priority as
self-evident, it is plain from Props.",1600-1700,919
"With regard to the
stage, they have excelled even the Greeks, who far excelled the English. And, in common life, they have, in a great measure, perfected that art,
the most useful and agreeable of any, _l'Art de Vivre_, the art of
society and conversation. If we consider the state of the sciences and polite arts in our own
country, Horace's observation, with regard to the Romans, may in a great
measure be applied to the British. Sed in longum tamen aevum

"Very good company we were at dinner, and merry, and after
dinner, he being gone about business, my wife and I and Mrs. Pierce and
Betty and Balty, who come to see us to-day very sick, and went home not
well, together out, and our coach broke the wheel off upon Ludgate Hill. So we were fain to part ourselves and get room in other people's coaches,
and Mrs. Pierce and I in one, and I carried her home and set her down, and
myself to the King's playhouse, which troubles me since, and hath cost me
a forfeit of 10s., which I have paid, and there did see a good part of
""The English Monsieur,"" which is a mighty pretty play, very witty and
pleasant. And the women do very well; but, above all, little Nelly; that
I am mightily pleased with the play, and much with the House, more than
ever I expected, the women doing better than ever I expected, and very
fine women. Here I was in pain to be seen, and hid myself; but, as God
would have it, Sir John Chichly come, and sat just by me. Thence to Mrs.
Pierce's, and there took up my wife and away home, and to the office and
Sir W. Batten's, of whom I hear that this Proviso in Parliament is
mightily ill taken by all the Court party as a mortal blow, and that, that
strikes deep into the King's prerogative, which troubles me mightily.",1600-1700,4170
"""But what
is that thing?"" he asked, pointing. ""It is the figure of a man, which I have modeled and re-modeled, sir,
but cannot seem to get exactly to my liking. So it is necessary that I
keep laboring at it until the figure is to my thinking and my desire."" ""But, Manuel, what need is there for you to model it at all?""",1600-1700,11639
"To this my effects were immediately removed. I was even too angry
to comply with the forms of good breeding so far as to leave my
compliments for the earl: I departed without ceremony, and retired to
my chamber to contemplate my change of situation. After mature consideration, the plan on which I determined was,
immediately to publish the fourth letter of Themistocles, already
written; to continue to write under the same signature; and in
the continuation to expose the political profligacy of the earl.",1700-1800,9811
"Wherefore they cried unto the Lord
and said: O Lord let us not perish for this mans death, neither lay
innocent blood unto our charge: for thou Lord even as thy pleasure was,
so thou hast done. And then they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the
sea left raging. And the men feared the Lord exceedingly: and
sacrificed sacrifice unto the Lord: and vowed vows. The second Chapter. But the Lord prepared a great fish, to swallow up Jonas.",1483-1600,27654
"Believe me

Yours very sincerely,
SALISBURY. Lord Randolph Churchill never doubted the meaning of the answer he had
received, and treated it as a formal acceptance of his resignation. He
concluded, as will appear, that the delay had been due to communications
with the Queen, and that the whole matter was now ended. He sat down at
once and wrote to Lord Salisbury a letter of farewell:--

"The battle was in fact won, no help could be sent to Tallard by
the Elector, a decisive charge of cavalry drove the enemy's horse off
the field, and the army fled in two bodies, one towards the river, the
other towards Hochstädt. Both were hotly pursued, and of those who fled
towards the river thousands perished in the stream. Blenheim still held
out, but, cut off from all succour, surrounded by the whole English
army, and threatened by the approaching artillery, the gallant garrison
was compelled to capitulate, and 11,000 men laid down their arms. The
right wing being completely destroyed, the Elector of Bavaria had found
it necessary to withdraw his troops from the battle, although they had
hitherto held their position against the fierce attacks of Eugene. In
the confusion he managed to retire without much loss.",1800-1900,47759
"On this account many of the seamen gave up the work, and
retreated into the boats and the large cutter behind the ship, or made
away in foreign boats, however much we implored of these not to carry
off our people. ""To those in our boat and great cutter, the captain called out from the
cabin window, that they should remember the oath they had sworn to him
and the magistracy, and not abandon him, but return on board, as at
present there was no danger, and by God's help the fire might be
extinguished. ""These certainly obeyed the command, and began to work again earnestly,
but it all was of no avail for the fire increased more and more. After
working assiduously but fruitlessly for two hours, the lieutenant and
shipmaster, as also the other officers, went to the captain, and
informed him that, alas! there was no more help, that it was impossible
to save the good ship, and it was now high time to save themselves, if
they did not intend to be burned in the ship or blown up with it.",1483-1600,33795
"'Of Fishe.' For foure monthes of the yeere, February, March, Aprill and May, there
are plentie of 'Sturgeons': And also in the same monethes of 'Herrings',
some of the ordinary bignesse as ours in England, but the most part
farre greater, of eighteene, twentie inches, and some two foote in
length and better; both these kindes of fishe in those monethes are most
plentifull, and in best season, which wee founde to bee most delicate
and pleasaunt meate. There are also 'Troutes, Porpoises, Rayes, Oldwiues, Mullets, Plaice,'
and very many other sortes of excellent good fish, which we haue taken &
eaten, whose names I know not but in the countrey language; wee haue of
twelue sorts more the pictures as they were drawn in the countrey with
their names. The inhabitants vse to take then two maner of wayes, the one is by a
kind of wear made of reedes which in that countrey are very strong.",1483-1600,4247
"In his gratitude he told me his
history. ""I don't care for art,"" he said. ""I am a good billiard player,
one of the best in Dublin; but my guardian said I must take a profession,
so I asked my friends to tell me where I would not have to pass an
examination, and here I am.""",1900-2000,33348
"Secondly, that you seeing and knowing the continuance of the action by
the view hereof you may generally know & learne what the countrey is; &
therevpon cosider how your dealing therein if it proceede, may returne
you profit and gaine; bee it either by inhabitting & planting or
otherwise in furthering thereof. And least that the substance of my relation should be doubtful vnto you,
as of others by reason of their diuersitie: I will first open the cause
in a few wordes wherefore they are [a 3]  so different; referring my
selue to your fauourable constructions, and to be adiudged of as by good
consideration you shall finde cause. Of our companie that returned some for their misdemenour and ill dealing
in the countrey, haue beene there worthily punished; who by reason of
their badde natures, haue maliciously not onelie spoken ill of their
Gouernours; but for their sakes slaundered the countrie it selfe. The
like also haue those done which were of their confort. Some beeing ignorant of the state thereof, nothwithstanding since their
returne amongest their friendes and acquaintance and also others,
especially if they were in companie where they might not be gainesaide;
woulde seeme to know so much as no men more; and make no men so great
trauailers as themselues.",1483-1600,4247
"Here the boardinghouse analogy breaks, breaks so
signally that I was lately moved to ask a distinguished editor why a book
of short stories usually failed and a magazine usually succeeded because
of them. He answered, gayly, that the short stories in most books of
them were bad; that where they were good, they went; and he alleged
several well-known instances in which books of prime short stories had a
great vogue. He was so handsomely interested in my inquiry that I could
not well say I thought some of the short stories which he had boasted in
his last number were indifferent good, and yet, as he allowed, had mainly
helped sell it. I had in mind many books of short stories of the first
excellence which had failed as decidedly as those others had succeeded,
for no reason that I could see; possibly there is really no reason in any
literary success or failure that can be predicted, or applied in another
Base.",1900-2000,3384
"But I will make you shrink your snaily horns! First, therefore, Audley, this shall be thy charge,
Go levy footmen for our wars in France;
And, Ned, take muster of our men at arms:
In every shire elect a several band. Let them be Soldiers of a lusty spirit,
Such as dread nothing but dishonor's blot;

A famous War, and with so mighty a nation. Derby, be thou Ambassador for us

"On this
score, they demand L1100 for Sir G. Ascue, and L5000 for the one province
of Zealand, for the prisoners that we have therein. He says that this is
a piece of shame that never any nation committed, and that our very Lords
here of the Council, when he related this matter to them, did not remember
that they had agreed to this article; and swears that all their articles
are alike, as the giving away Polleroon, and Surinam, and Nova Scotia,
which hath a river 300 miles up the country, with copper mines more than
Swedeland, and Newcastle coals, the only place in America that hath coals
that we know of; and that Cromwell did value those places, and would for
ever have made much of them; but we have given them away for nothing,
besides a debt to the King of Denmarke. But, which is most of all, they
have discharged those very particular demands of merchants of the Guinny
Company and others, which he, when he was there, had adjusted with the
Dutch, and come to an agreement in writing, and they undertaken to
satisfy, and that this was done in black and white under their hands; and
yet we have forgiven all these, and not so much as sent to Sir G. Downing
to know what he had done, or to confer with him about any one point of the
treaty, but signed to what they would have, and we here signed to whatever
in grosse was brought over by Mr. Coventry. And [Sir G. Downing] tells
me, just in these words, ""My Lord Chancellor had a mind to keep himself
from being questioned by clapping up a peace upon any terms."" When I
answered that there was other privy-councillors to be advised with besides
him, and that, therefore, this whole peace could not be laid to his
charge, he answered that nobody durst say any thing at the council-table
but himself, and that the King was as much afeard of saying any thing
there as the meanest privy-councillor; and says more, that at this day the
King, in familiar talk, do call the Chancellor ""the insolent man,"" and
says that he would not let him speak himself in Council: which is very
high, and do shew that the Chancellor is like to be in a bad state, unless
he can defend himself better than people think.",1600-1700,4180

Mars. The seed of this Star Thistle made into powder, and drank in
wine, provokes urine, and helps to break the stone, and drives it

"It was the
happiest possible fate that threw those two men together, for Boswell
besides being an admirer and reporter sedulously chronicling all his
master said and did, fortunately influenced both the saying and the
doing. Most of us have some one in whose company we best shine, who puts
our wits on their mettle and spurs us to our greatest readiness and
vivacity. There is no doubt that Boswell, for all his assumed humility
and for all Johnson's affected disdain, was just such a companion for
Johnson. Johnson was at his best when Boswell was present, and Boswell
not only drew Johnson out on subjects in which his robust common sense
and readiness of judgment were fitted to shine but actually suggested
and conducted that tour in Scotland which gave Johnson an opportunity
for displaying himself at his best. The recorded talk is
extraordinarily varied and entertaining.",1900-2000,11327

or a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of jokers feel any
compassion for him when they saw him down; so far from that,
extinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the
calls to arms with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and slashing at
him over the shield with their swords in such a way that, if he had not
gathered himself together and made himself small and drawn in his head
between the shields, it would have fared badly with the poor governor,
as, squeezed into that narrow compass, he lay, sweating and sweating
again, and commending himself with all his heart to God to deliver him
from his present peril. Some stumbled over him, others fell upon him, and
one there was who took up a position on top of him for some time, and
from thence as if from a watchtower issued orders to the troops, shouting
out, ""Here, our side! Here the enemy is thickest!",1600-1700,5936
"The friars in the Philippines are, as can be seen, absolute in the
provinces. It is quite true that, according to the ordinances, the
governor ought to send the auditors there from time to time in the
quality of visitors. But besides that that scarcely ever happens, these
visitors, although members of the royal Audiencia, are obliged to take
recommendations from the convents of Manila before their departure,
in order to be well received. However, that great authority of the
friars over the people does not prevent the latter from revolting very
often in the provinces; and those revolts are nearly always followed
by the death of some religious. Then there is no means of restoring
order except by sending troops to reduce the Indians to obedience,
for the eloquence of the religious can do nothing.",1600-1700,25930

"Contractions, however, certainly may be excited in different parts of a
frog, without making any division of its skin, by laying the part of
the frog to be excited upon a plate of zinc, or tin-foil, and passing a
piece of silver over it, till all three are in contact with each
other[7]. Yet even here the influence does not pass into the part in so
diffused a state as it may at first appear to do. For the skin of these
animals is abundantly supplied with nerves, whose trunks communicate,
at different places, with those which supply the muscles. And the
contractions are always strongest, and most readily excited, when the
silver is passed over the course of any of the nerves, which go to the
muscles. From the fact, which I have before mentioned, that a limb may be made
to contract, when the metals have apparently no communication with any
part of it except its nerve; it might reasonably be doubted, whether,
in any case, a communication between the muscles, as well as the nerve,
and the metals, were necessary, in order that contractions may be
excited.",1700-1800,46820

has doubtless injured the popularity of his work. But it was not, after all, as a poet that Gautier was to achieve either
profit or fame. For the theatre, he had but little gift, and his
dramatic efforts (if we except certain masques or ballets in which his
exuberant and graceful fancy came into play) are by far his weakest.",1600-1700,37282

"The Horseman, upon those Occasions,

alarm the Horse, and extinguish his Courage and Vigour, should first
endeavour to lead him gently towards the Object that terrifies him,

him, to make him go up to it. If he wont go towards it, you may give
him the Spurs, but with Discretion, and by Coaxing and Caresses push
him towards it insensibly; severe Correction will never cure him of
this fearful Temper, which is a Fault inherent in his Nature, nor of
any Imperfections in his Sight, which is a Disorder belonging to him,

severe Correction, and you will bestow them in proportion to the Effect
they produce. For the rest, be careful never to surprize a young
Horse who is shy, and apt to start, never terrify him with what he

of the claims of capital to its industrial rewards, whether in the form
of rent, interest or profits of trade and investment. To any advance in the arts of industry or the comforts of life, a rate
of production exceeding the rate of consumption, with consequent
accumulation of resources, or in other words, the formation of capital,
is indispensable. The primitive cultivators of the soil, whether those
of ancient times or the pioneers who formed settlements in the forests
of the New World, soon discovered that their labour would be rendered
more effective by implements and auxiliary powers of various kinds, and
that until the produce from existing means of cultivation exceeded what
was necessary for their subsistence, there could be neither labour on
their part to produce such implements and auxiliaries, nor means to
purchase them.",1900-2000,33127

the Experiments of my Liquor, both in regard to its bringing out,

You, the Best of Judges, was to me the greatest Honour I could wish
for; but the additional one, confer’d by your introducing me to the
_Royal Society_, and there having not only their unanimous Approbation,
but yours and their Thanks for my Discoveries and Intent of publishing
them, was beyond my Hopes, and a Pleasure so great, as to be past
expressing; in regard that it dissipates all my Fears for its Success,
and makes me justly hope it will meet with a candid Reception from, and
be of general Benefit to the Publick.",1700-1800,49564

well when he was regarded merely as a humorist, and one opened his books

literature; and a complete, uniform edition of his _Works_ would perhaps
have been received with something of the mockery that greeted Ben
Jonson's folio in 1616. Professor Richardson's _American Literature_,
which is still a standard work, appeared originally in 1886. My copy,
which bears the date 1892, contains only two references in the index to
Mark Twain, while Mr. Cable, for example, receives ten; and the whole
volume fills exactly nine hundred and ninety pages.",1700-1800,38068
"Piles may co-exist in some cases of ballooning, but are usually not
annoying. It is the local anal or external annoyances that compel the sufferer to
seek medical advice and aid, and he learns that the troubles complained
of are only symptoms of a chronic disease, therefore easily removed
without harsh treatment while the cause is being properly cured. It is very fortunate for the sufferer from ballooning of the rectum to
have in or near the anal canal those painful hints or symptoms of a
very grave and long existing disease whose constitutional symptoms were
well marked but attributed to other causes, especially to disease of the
liver--an organ of _so much solicitude_ that the poor liver-worshipping
patient ought to receive more gracious response from it. In every case of chronic proctitis, or inflammation of the anus and
rectum, the sigmoid flexure must be more or less dilated, as the upper
part of the rectum is very irritable and contracted and inhibits the
feces from passing beyond the sigmoid; but this irritability and
contraction of the rectum, as a rule, is not nearly so severe as that
of the anal canal, whose orifice is closed by very strong sphincter
muscles. Such being the pathological change in the sigmoid flexure and
especially in the lower portion of the rectum, as described in these
two chapters, who, with ordinary intelligence and an idea of
cleanliness, would take or prescribe remedies to move the bowels, if it
were possible to cleanse the foul capacious cavities with water?",1900-2000,26365

this and become defiant, see whom you have brought upon you: if you
succeed and prosper, you may before all the world call God and me a
liar. We have exhorted, warned, and protested enough; he who will not heed or
believe it may go on until he learns this by experience Yet it must be
impressed upon the young that they may be careful not to follow the old
lawless crowd, but keep their eyes fixed upon God's commandment, lest
His wrath and punishment come upon them too.",1700-1800,1722

"The reformation was preceded
by the discovery of America, as if the Almighty graciously meant to
open a sanctuary to the persecuted in future years, when home should
afford neither friendship nor safety. The authority of Great-Britain over this continent, is a form of
government, which sooner or later must have an end: And a serious
mind can draw no true pleasure by looking forward, under the painful
and positive conviction, that what he calls ""the present
constitution"" is merely temporary. As parents, we can have no joy,
knowing that this government is not sufficiently lasting to ensure
any thing which we may bequeath to posterity: And by a plain method
of argument, as we are running the next generation into debt, we
ought to do the work of it, otherwise we use them meanly and
pitifully. In order to discover the line of our duty rightly, we
should take our children in our hand, and fix our station a few
years farther into life; that eminence will present a prospect,

desecration is most apparent. The same is true of such paintings as are
found hung in the churches, though seldom have they great names attached
to them; at least, not so great as would mark them for distinction were
they hung in any of the leading picture galleries of Europe. At Essen the baptistery is separated from the main church, like that at

"A passage in the lives of these sisters
illustrates very forcibly the kind of sisterly affection which prevailed
in the family of the Ptolemies. The case was this:

There were two princes of Syria, a country lying northeast of the
Mediterranean Sea, and so not very far from Egypt, who, though they were
brothers, were in a state of most deadly hostility to each other. One had
attempted to poison the other, and afterward a war had broken out between
them, and all Syria was suffering from the ravages of their armies.",1800-1900,40205
"In that work I have entered fully into the
    subject, and have proved that all the parties who suffered were
    executed for treason.] It is constantly asserted by Roman Catholic writers, that the priests
who suffered during this reign were martyrs to the faith: and the
inference is attempted to be drawn, that the church of England is as
much exposed to the charge of persecution as the church of Rome. One
thing is certain, however, that, whether the advisers of Elizabeth were
justified in their course or otherwise, they did not consider that they
were putting men to death for religion: but, on the other hand, the
martyrs under Queen Mary were committed to the flames as heretics, not
as traitors or offenders against the laws of the land. When, therefore,
Romanist writers attempt to draw a parallel between the martyrs of the
Anglican church under Queen Mary, and the priests who suffered in the
reign of Elizabeth, it is a sufficient answer to their cavils to allege
the fact, that the former were put to death according to the mode
prescribed in cases of heresy, which was an offence against religion;
the latter were tried and executed for treason, which is an offence
against the state.",1600-1700,31031

Spirituality of Nature


§ 10

One thing at least is certain. Of this human race, of which each of us
frail and wailing mortals is a fragment, this kindly or unkindly thing
we call ""external Nature"" is at once the mother, the cradle, and the
home: out of it we came; in it we play; from it we delve our livelihood;
and--to it we go.",1900-2000,46030

"But whether it arose from that
""old-fashioned"" quality of which Major Strickland had made mention,
which caused me to seem so much older than my years; or whether it
arose from the genuine interest I showed in all he had to say; certain
it is that long before we got back to Rose Cottage we were talking as
equals in years and understanding, but that by no means prevented me
from looking up to him in my own mind as to a being superior not only
to myself but to the common run of humanity. I was sorry when we got
back in sight of the weir, and as I stepped ashore I thought that this
morning and the one I had spent with Sister Agnes in Charke Forest
were the two happiest of my life. I had no prevision that the

"I was in great pain for my two shallops in this tempest, but they had
both the good luck to lie close under the shore; and one indeed had
hauled quite upon the land, where the men lay on shore under their sail,
so that they got no damage; and about three days after, one of them
returned, and brought me word they had been to the west, where they had
made very little discovery, as to the situation of the country, or
whether it was an island or a continent, but they had conversed with the
natives very often, and found several who had pieces of gold hanging,
some in their hair, some about their necks; and they made a shift to
bring as many with them as weighed, all put together, seventeen or
eighteen ounces, for which they had bartered toys and trifles, as we
did; but they found no rivers, where they could discover any gold in
the sands, as We had done, so that they believed it all came from the
side where we were. But our other shallop had much better luck; she went away to the east,
and by the time she had gone about sixteen leagues she found the shore
break off a little, and soon after a little more, until at length they
came as it were to the land's end; when, the shore running due south,
they followed, according to their account, near thirteen leagues more. In this interval they went several times on shore, entered three rivers,
indifferently large, and one of them very large at the mouth, but grew
narrow again in three or four leagues; but a deep channel, with
two-and-twenty to eight-and-twenty fathom water in it all the way, as
far as they went. Here they went on shore and trafficked with the natives, whom they found
rude and unpolished, but a very mild inoffensive people; nor did they
find them anything thievish, much less treacherous, as in some countries
is the case. They had the good luck to find out the place where, as they
supposed, the king of the country resided; which was a kind of a city,
encompassed all round, the river making a kind of double horse-shoe.",1700-1800,35774

"The ""Bell"" is, or should be, famous as the inn where ""Stilton"" cheese was
first introduced to an appreciative and unduly confiding world. It was an
old-time landlord, the sporting Cooper Thornhill, who flourished, and rode
horseback in record time to London and back to Stilton again, about 1740,
to whom the world was thus originally indebted. He obtained his cheese
from a Mrs. Paulet of Wymondham, who at first supplied him with this
product of her dairy for the use of coach-passengers dining at his table. Her cheeses at once appealed to connoisseurs, and Thornhill presently
began to supply them to travellers eager to take this new-found delicacy
away with them. He was too business-like a man to disclose the secret of
their origin, and it was long supposed they came from a dairy at Stilton
belonging to him.",1900-2000,43866
"We could not learn
of Berreo any other way to enter but in branches so far to windward as
it was impossible for us to recover; for we had as much sea to cross
over in our wherries, as between Dover and Calice, and in a great
hollow, the wind and current being both very strong. So as we were
driven to go in those small boats directly before the wind into the
bottom of the Bay of Guanipa, and from thence to enter the mouth of some
one of those rivers which John Douglas had last discovered; and had
with us for pilot an Indian of Barema, a river to the south of Orenoque,
between that and Amazons, whose canoas we had formerly taken as he
was going from the said Barema, laden with cassavi bread to sell at
Margarita. This Arwacan promised to bring me into the great river of
Orenoque; but indeed of that which he entered he was utterly ignorant,
for he had not seen it in twelve years before, at which time he was very
young, and of no judgment. And if God had not sent us another help, we
might have wandered a whole year in that labyrinth of rivers, ere we had
found any way, either out or in, especially after we were past ebbing
and flowing, which was in four days. For I know all the earth doth not
yield the like confluence of streams and branches, the one crossing
the other so many times, and all so fair and large, and so like one to
another, as no man can tell which to take: and if we went by the sun or
compass, hoping thereby to go directly one way or other, yet that way we
were also carried in a circle amongst multitudes of islands, and every
island so bordered with high trees as no man could see any further than
the breadth of the river, or length of the breach.",1483-1600,2272
"Thus Titus Livius
may receive as a present, or may buy his own books from Dorus. Although the wise man possesses everything, yet I can give him what I
individually possess; for though, king-like, he in his mind possesses
everything, yet the ownership of all things is divided among various
individuals, so that he can both receive a present and owe one; can
buy, or hire things. Everything belongs to Caesar; yet he has no private
property beyond his own privy purse; as Emperor all things are his,
but nothing is his own except what he inherits. It is possible, without
treason, to discuss what is and what is not his; for even what the court
may decide not to be his, from another point of view is his. In the same
way the wise man in his mind possesses everything, in actual right and
ownership he possesses only his own property.",1600-1700,3794

MISS HENDERSON’S THANKSGIVING DAY. Thanksgiving Day dawned clearly and frostily upon the little village

way home was by a long roundabout walk through our place, and then by a
short one along the public road. When I turned into the winding, shady
path which led through the thick barrier of trees hiding the Beecher
wall, she was loitering slowly along before me; and though she quickened
her pace when she heard me behind her, as a hint that I need not follow,
I soon caught up with her, and then I was sorry I had tried to, for I
saw that she was crying most undisguisedly and unbecomingly. ""Miss Beecher--Eleanor,"" I stammered out, ""you mustn't mind it--she
didn't mean it--it was too bad--I was a little provoked myself--but
don't feel so about it."" ""Oh, it's not that,"" said Eleanor, stopping short, and steadying her
trembling voice, so that it seemed as if she were practised in stifling
her emotions.",1800-1900,36196

"Wearied and disappointed, Emily first ridiculed, though she shared, her
fears, and then tried to sooth them; but neither attempt succeeded, and
the girl persisted in believing and affirming, that what she had seen
was nothing human. It was not till some time after Emily had recovered
her composure, that she recollected the steps she had heard on the
stair-case--a remembrance, however, which made her insist that Annette
should pass the night with her, and, with much difficulty, she, at
length, prevailed, assisted by that part of the girl's fear, which
concerned the corridor. Early on the following morning, as Emily crossed the hall to the
ramparts, she heard a noisy bustle in the court-yard, and the clatter of
horses' hoofs. Such unusual sounds excited her curiosity; and, instead
of going to the ramparts, she went to an upper casement, from whence
she saw, in the court below, a large party of horsemen, dressed in a
singular, but uniform, habit, and completely, though variously, armed. They wore a kind of short jacket, composed of black and scarlet, and
several of them had a cloak, of plain black, which, covering the person
entirely, hung down to the stirrups.",1700-1800,3268

"For all that, the following Danish governments found this institution
so profitable, that they undertook the direction of it, and it was not
until public opinion began to become very decided about this corruption
offered to the poorer classes, that it was entirely abolished in the
reign of Christian VIII. Struensee only authorised the establishment
of the lottery, it is urged, because at that time the country swarmed
with pedlars, who sold tickets of foreign lotteries, by which a great
deal of money was drawn out of the country, and he tried to prevent
this by starting a home lottery for gamblers. A number of pamphlets at
once appeared in Copenhagen and other towns of the kingdom, in which
the ruinous results of lottery gambling were shown, though without any
effect. When the lottery was established at Copenhagen and Wandsbeck, the
people were attacked by a perfect mania for gambling, and while formerly
the conversation in the houses of citizens turned on the weather and town
scandal, they now talked about the best way of playing, about ambos,
ternes, and quaterns, &c.

        October, 1872. PREFACE. Before quitting England for a first visit to Spain in the Autumn of
1869, I made up my mind both to see and draw as much of the
Architectural remains of that country as the time and means at my
disposal would permit; and further determined so to draw as to admit of
the publication of my sketches and portions of my notes on the objects
represented, in the precise form in which they might be made.",1800-1900,33820

"Besides, as there is no term almost in any sentence, but is
capable of several acceptions; so, since no falshood, no discord is in
the Scriptures, there is no sentence in it, however sounding for the
expression, but must be reconciled in its sense to all the rest; and
for this a diligent comparing of Texts is necessary, to attain the
true meaning of many places, that seem at the first sight most clear
in what they say, but that there are also other places as clear that
seem to say the contrary: And some such places they were, (and that in
very necessary points too) of which St. _Peter_ saith; _That some
wrested them to their own damnation_[24]_: wrested them_, because they
wanted (not industry, but) learning; _which the unlearned_ (saith he)
_wrest_----And indeed commonly the most ignorant have the
strongliest-conceited certainty for what they apprehend or believe,
because they know fewest reasons against it; whilst, by much study and
comparing several Revelations one with another, those come at last to
doubt, or deny that sense of some of them, which at the first they
took for most certainly and evidently true. Pardon this long

"The stadholder was feasted and honoured by the mutineers during his brief
visit to Hoogatraaten, and concluded with them a convention, according to
which that town was to be restored to him, while they were to take
temporary possession of the city of Grave. They were likewise to assist,
with all their strength, in his military operations until they should
make peace on their own terms with the archduke. For two weeks after such
treaty they were not to fight against the States, and meantime, though
fighting on the republican side, they were to act as an independent corps
and in no wise to be merged in the stadholder's forces.",1483-1600,4884

"Chance may produce pathetic situations, but not tragic
ones.’”

Helwyze paused there abruptly; for the memory which served him so well
outran his tongue, and recalled the closing sentence of the
quotation,—words which he had no mind to utter then and there,—“Fate
ought always to be terrible; and it is in the highest sense tragic, when
it brings into a ruinous concatenation the guilty man and the guiltless
with him.”

“Then you think I _could_ write a play?” asked Canaris, with affected
carelessness. “I think you could act one, better than imagine or write it.”

“What, I?”

“Yes, you; because you are dramatic by nature, and it is easier for you
to express yourself in gesture and tone, than by written or spoken
language. You were born for an actor, are fitted for it in every way,
and I advise you to try it. It would pay better than poetry; and that
stream _may_ run dry.”

Gladys looked indignant at what she thought bad advice and distasteful
pleasantry; but Canaris seemed struck and charmed with the new idea,
protesting that he would first write, then act, his play, and prove
himself a universal genius.",1800-1900,54212

"Hast thou not felt him, oh my soul! like another soul, [Transcriber's note: illegible] thy faculties,
exalting thy views, purifying thy passions, exalting thy graces, and
begetting in thee an abhorrence of sin, and a love of holiness? Is not
all this an argument of His presence, as truly as if thou didst see.""] On the whole, if habitual love to God, firm faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ, a steady dependence on the divine promises, a full persuasion of
the wisdom and goodness of all the dispensations of Providence, a high
esteem for the blessings of the heavenly world, and a sincere contempt
for the vanities of this, can properly be called enthusiasm, then was
Colonel Gardiner indeed one of the greatest enthusiasts which our age

esteem him one of the wisest and happiest of mankind.",1700-1800,11253

Dulverton. The Duchess was not only a believer in the existence of a sunken treasure
of alluring proportions; she also believed that she knew of a method by
which the said treasure might be precisely located and cheaply
disembedded. An aunt on her mother’s side of the family had been Maid of

harder than during that May week spent in Paris. I am inclined now, in

myself when I recall how many articles I had to write, how many prints
and drawings, statues and pictures, I had to look at in order to write
them, and my success in never leaving my editors in the lurch. My
admiration is the greater because nobody could know as well as I how
slow I have always been with my work and also, to do myself justice, how
conscientious, as I do not mind saying, though to be called
conscientious by anybody else would seem to me only less offensive than
to be called good-natured or amiable.",1900-2000,24452
"Having spared no pains in collecting
his materials, he told his story, as we all know, with flowing ease and
stirring vitality. His views may have been more or less partial; Philip
the Second may have deserved the pitying benevolence of poor Maximilian;
Maurice may have wept as sincerely over the errors of Arminius as any one
of ""the crocodile crew that believe in election;"" Barneveld and Grotius
may have been on the road to Rome; none of these things seem probable,
but if they were all proved true in opposition to his views, we should
still have the long roll of glowing tapestry he has woven for us, with
all its life-like portraits, its almost moving pageants, its sieges where
we can see the artillery flashing, its battle-fields with their smoke and
fire,--pictures which cannot fade, and which will preserve his name
interwoven with their own enduring colors. Republics are said to be ungrateful; it might be truer to say that they

times the expense for which at least equally good can be brought

importation of all foreign wines, merely to encourage the making of
claret and Burgundy in Scotland? But if there would be a manifest
absurdity in turning towards any employment thirty times more of the
capital and industry of the country than would be necessary to purchase
from foreign countries an equal quantity of the commodities wanted,
there must be an absurdity, though not altogether so glaring, yet
exactly of the same kind, in turning towards any such employment a
thirtieth, or even a three hundredth part more of either. Whether the
advantages which one country has over another be natural or acquired, is

covered with a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one
of the goatherds said, ""Those who come there are the bearers of
Chrysostom's body, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he
ordered them to bury him."" They therefore made haste to reach the spot,
and did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground,
and four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of
a hard rock. They greeted each other courteously, and then Don Quixote
and those who accompanied him turned to examine the bier, and on it,
covered with flowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to
all appearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that
in life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on
the bier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded;

far greater heat than that which on the Surface of our Earth would very
easily turn them into Vapours and Fumes. And the same great weight may
condense those Vapours and Exhalations as soon as they shall at any time
begin to ascend from the Sun, and make them presently fall back again
into him, and by that action increase his Heat much after the manner

and fifty miles short of its goal; there are no earnings to maintain
the investment. The reaction of high interest rates on the practical sense of American
capitalists and engineers has made operation at the earliest possible
moment and with the smallest possible investment of capital the very
essence of American railway building in new territory. Actual earnings
are expected to furnish capital, or a basis for credit, with which to
make good early engineering defects. All this, of course, is but
another way of saying that the criterion of engineering efficiency is
not ""perfection,"" but ""good enough.""",1900-2000,29674

spirit was infused, rendering the programme monotonous and unattractive. Having a little time at my disposal, I determined upon founding a series
of Penny Readings, having for its objects—“presenting a counter

pure and standard literature.”  With this view, I gave an inaugural

"We being the
only persons that were spared, we were put into another company, and
marched on the same day against the rebels, and were successful in all
our attempts. I was for three weeks night and day fighting, some times
wet through with rain, and at other times suffocated with the heat:
all that while, I never knew what it was to lay down or take rest;
neither having an opportunity to put clean linen on: but at last we
returned into the Town, where we took some refreshment and put clean
linen on, for we had need of it. No sooner was I refreshed, but I was
ordered to carry some letters of consequence to a camp nine miles off;
but as the road was very dangerous, I asked one of my comrades to go
with me, which he did with great pleasure; we arrived at the camp
without the least injury or danger: but it was not with the same luck
we went back, for as we were passing through a dark Wood, (_it was
then between ten and eleven o'Clock at night_,) a shower of musket
balls were fired at us, which unexpected noise and hissing, so much
frighted our horses, that it was impossible for us to lead them; they
rushed through brambles and briers, and at last plunged into a dead
Lake, where we had like to have been drowned; but our horses being
stout animals, they swam and gained the other side in a few minutes. We made the best of our way through woods and thickets to escape the
fury of the balls which were continually flying about us, and after
having wandered a great while through unpracticable places, we found
again the road, and rode as fast as we could to the Town: since that
affair I have been in many obstinate and bloody engagements.",1800-1900,44974

Was all the daughters that this Phillip had,
Whom afterward your father took to wife;
And from the fragrant garden of her womb
Your gracious self, the flower of Europe's hope,
Derived is inheritor to France. But note the rancor of rebellious minds:
When thus the lineage of le Bew was out,
The French obscured your mother's Privilege,
And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed
John, of the house of Valois, now their king:
The reason was, they say, the Realm of France,
Replete with Princes of great parentage,
Ought not admit a governor to rule,
Except he be descended of the male;
And that's the special ground of their contempt,
Wherewith they study to exclude your grace:
But they shall find that forged ground of theirs
To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand. Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,
That I, a French man, should discover this;

giant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and height, he
shorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees, saying, Now art
thou better of a size to deal with than thou were, and after smote off

man to have ado with him: and for because at this time he hath done over
much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it were great
shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time, insomuch as he

"CHAP. XXI. _Of the Step and Leap._


THE Step and Leap is composed of three Airs; of the _Step_, which is the
Action of the _Terre-a-Terre_; the rising before, which is a _Curvet_;
and the Leap, which is a _Capriole_. THIS Manage is infinitely less painful to a Horse than that of the
_Capriole_; for when you dress a Horse to the _Capriole_, he will
of himself take this Air for his Ease and Relief; and in time those
Horses, which have been drest to the _Caprioles_, will execute only
_Balotades_ and _Croupades_, unless particular Care is taken to make
them yerk out. IT is this likewise, which, next to running a brisk Course, enlivens
and animates a Horse most.--To reduce a Horse to the Justness of this
Air, you must begin by emboldening and making him lose all fear of
Correction; teaching him to keep his Head steady, and in a proper
Place; lightening His Fore-parts, by putting him to make _Pesades_;
teaching him to know the Aids of the Switch, the same as in the Lesson
of the _Caprioles_; and by giving him a firm and good _Apuy_, _full in
the Hand_: though it is certain, that the _Step_ contributes to give
him this _Apuy_, inasmuch as that it puts him in the Hand; besides that
it gives him Strength and Agility to leap, just as we ourselves leap
with a quicker Spring while running, than if we were to stand quite
still and leap; therefore most old Horses generally fall into this Air.",1700-1800,46696

towns, and which could not be effected solely by force of arms. When the Governor ad interim returned to Manila, he sent an embassy
to the Rajah of Borneo, but without effect, as he had no wish to
be on terms with the Spaniards. He likewise divided the province
of Ylocos between the Colonel and Juan de Salcedo, who had been
employed in that expedition. In the beginning of the year 1574, Juan
de Salcedo sailed to take possession of his portion; he founded in
the district of Bigan the city Fernandina, where he built a house for
himself. While he was accomplishing this object, a large squadron of
vessels passed by, which had taken a galeot and twenty men he had sent
in search of provisions; and presuming that their intention was to
attack him, he began to fortify the town, but seeing they prosecuted
their route, he took it for granted they were going against Manila;
and having collected together all the Spaniards he had in Ylocos,
he embarked for the capital to the assistance of the Governor.",1800-1900,39010

"With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and passed
into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who were
there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty. Some--those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright
eyes--made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frank
declaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting
occasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,
Don Quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a
loud and distinct voice:

""Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the beautiful
Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She has shown by
clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found
with her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far she is from
yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which reason, instead of
being followed and persecuted, she should in justice be honoured and
esteemed by all the good people of the world, for she shows that she is
the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution."" Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because Ambrosio
told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of the
shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the grave
and burned Chrysostom's papers, they laid his body in it, not without
many tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave with a heavy
stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to have
prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:

Beneath the stone before your eyes
The body of a lover lies;
In life he was a shepherd swain,
In death a victim to disdain.",1600-1700,5907

"And so on the morn as Launcelot and Sir
Cador, chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the prisoners,
as they should pass through a wood, Sir Launcelot sent certain knights
to espy if any were in the woods to let them. And when the said knights
came into the wood, anon they espied and saw the great embushment, and
returned and told Sir Launcelot that there lay in await for them three
score thousand Romans. And then Sir Launcelot with such knights as he
had, and men of war to the number of ten thousand, put them in array,
and met with them and fought with them manly, and slew and detrenched
many of the Romans, and slew many knights and admirals of the party
of the Romans and Saracens; there was slain the king of Lyly and three
great lords, Aladuke, Herawd, and Heringdale. But Sir Launcelot fought
so nobly that no man might endure a stroke of his hand, but where he
came he showed his prowess and might, for he slew down right on every
side; and the Romans and Saracens fled from him as the sheep from the
wolf or from the lion, and put them, all that abode alive, to flight. And so long they fought that tidings came to King Arthur, and anon he
graithed him and came to the battle, and saw his knights how they had
vanquished the battle, he embraced them knight by knight in his arms,
and said, Ye be worthy to wield all your honour and worship; there was
never king save myself that had so noble knights.",1483-1600,1251

"The first volume treats of the
various readings that occur in the Pentateuch; the second volume of
those in the books of Josue, Judges, Ruth, and the four books of Kings. It is a well known fact that there are to be found in the Vulgate some
additions (_additamenta_) which are wanting in the Hebrew text, and even
in the best codices of St Jerome's version. These additions have been
distributed by F. Vercellone in four classes: 1^o, those found only in
codices of no great antiquity; 2^o, those found in old and accurate
editions of the Vulgate; 3^o, those allowed to stand in the Sixtine
edition; 4^o, those allowed to stand even in the Clementine. It must not
be believed that the Vatican editors were ignorant of the character of
these additions, or that they admitted them through carelessness; for,
in their preface, they distinctly say, ""Nonnulla quae mutanda
videbantur, consulto immutata relicta sunt, ad offensionem populorum
vitandam"".... These additions found their way into the text, according
to our author, from four sources; 1. most of them from the Greek
version, or the Vetus Itala; 2. not a few from a double version made of
a verse, and transcribed as if the translation of two distinct verses;
3. from marginal glosses; and, 4. lastly, from parallel passages in the

"This peculiarity consists
in a folding or doubling of the skin and its appendages beneath the lower
part of the belly in the females, in such a manner as to form an open
pouch or bag, in which the young are contained from a very early period,
in which the process of suckling takes place, and in which, even for some
time after they have acquired sufficient size and strength to leave it,
the little ones continue to take refuge. But the presence of this one anomalous characteristic is accompanied
by so many striking discrepancies in other parts, that, limited as
this tribe is in number, most of the principal forms of Mammalia find
analogous representations among its groups. Thus the Opossums exhibit
characters in some measure intermediate between the Quadrumana and the
Carnivora, to which latter the Dasyuri, another Marsupial group, closely
resembling the Civets in form and habits, approach very nearly; while
the herbivorous races of the tribe might occupy a station between the
Rodent and Ruminant Orders, with each of which they exhibit various
degrees of relationship. This want of uniformity in the essential parts
of their organization necessarily gives rise to much difficulty in
determining their position in the system.",1800-1900,53764

ignorance, and carries him as far as human intellect can go. Along

"He had
used to imagine that the justice of God required the damnation of so
enormous a sinner as he saw himself to be; but now he was made deeply
sensible that the divine justice might be not only vindicated, but
glorified, in saving him by the blood of Jesus, even that blood which
cleanseth us from all sin. Then did he see and feel the riches of
redeeming love and grace in such a manner as not only engaged him with
the utmost pleasure and confidence to venture his soul upon it, but even
swallowed up, as it were, his whole heart in the returns of love, which
from that blessed time became this genuine and delightful principle of
his obedience, and animated him, with an enlarged heart, to run the way
of God's commandments. Thus God was pleased (as he himself used to speak)
in an hour to turn his captivity. All the terrors of his former state
were changed into unutterable joy, which kept him almost continually
waking for three nights together, and yet refreshed him as the noblest of
cordials. His expressions, though naturally very strong, always seemed

he hath the Vanity to believe it to be intirely his own work; 'tis

is of believing those, Dr. _Stillingfleet_ states on this
manner [101]----_That the belief of a thing may be supposed necessary,
either as to the matter, because the matter is to be believed in it
self necessary; or because of the clear conviction of mens
understandings; that, though the matters be not in themselves
necessary, yet being revealed by God, they must be explicitly
believed: but then, the necessity of this belief doth extend no
further, than the clearness of the conviction doth._ Again, _that the
necessity of believing any thing arising from the Church's definition_
[upon which motive you seem to press the belief of the Article of
_Consubstantiality_] _doth depend upon the Conviction, that whatever
the Church defines is necessary to be believed. And, where that is not
received as an antecedent principle, the other cannot be supposed._
[Now this principle neither I, nor yet Protestants, accept]. Then he
concludes----_That as to the Athanasian Creed_ [and the same it is for
the _Nicene_.]",1600-1700,41421

A LETTER FROM A CLERGYMAN TO HIS FRIEND. _Sir_,

To let the Town into the chief Motives for this Publication, I am
obliged to acquaint them, that it is my Love of Truth and Justice,
enforc'd by my Inclination to please my Friend; the Motive, all will
undoubtedly allow to be a laudable one; and I could, if required,
give so many unanswerable Reason for being influenc'd by the Latter,
that to an impartial Reader it would appear almost as sufficient, for
my proceeding thus, as the Former.",1700-1800,29189
"Far from seeing any impediment, I see that everything
invites you to do what I ask, and that you may so use the daily and
supersubstantial Bread I make you this present, entreating you not to
forget at the holy Altar him who makes you this prayer on the part of God
Himself."" The young Priest was somewhat surprised, and without attempting to evade
the implied rebuke contented himself with submitting to the judgment of the
holy Bishop his secret unworthiness, his youth, his unmortified passions,
his fear of misusing so divine a mystery by not living as they should live
who each day offer it up. ""All this excusing yourself, replied our Blessed Father, is only so much
self-accusing as would appear if I chose to examine your reasons in detail
and weigh them in the scales of the sanctuary. But without entering into
any discussion of them let it suffice that you refer the matter to my
judgment.",1600-1700,9184
"AMEN. _But at Evening Prayer, instead of the foregoing Collect, the

Love of thy only Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. AMEN. O God, the Creator and Preserver of all Mankind, we humbly beseech
thee for all Sorts and Conditions of Men; that thou wouldest be
pleased to make thy Ways known unto them, thy saving Health unto
all Nations.",1700-1800,30545

_Sir_, I do affirm unto your Majesty, that you may give Command to have

Degrees and forty Minutes of the Southern Elevation, and those that
shall inhabit there shall have plenty of Riches, and all other
Conveniences which they can desire. Time will shew and discover all
these Commodities, and in this place there may be made the Discharge and
Unloading of all the Wares and Merchandizes of the Countries of
_Chilly_, _Peru_, _Panania_, _Macaraqua_, _Guttimala_, _New-Spain_,
_Terre-natte_, and the _Philippines_, all which Countries are under the
Command of your Majesty. And if you shall acquire unto your self the
Dominion of these Seigniories which I do now present, I do make so great
an Esteem of them, that besides their being the Key of all the rest,
they will (in my Opinion) prove another _China_ or _Japan_, and equalize
the other rich Islands which are on this side of _Asia_ in Traffick of
curious and precious Merchandizes, to speak nothing of the Augmentation

it a Boil; then put them by in some Pot to be candied, as hereafter
mentioned, whenever you shall have Occasion. _To candy Orange, Lemon, and Citron._

Drain what Quantity you will candy clean from the Syrup, and wash it
in luke-warm Water, and lay it on a Sieve to drain; then take as much
clarified Sugar as you think will cover what you will candy, boil it
till it blows very strong, then put in your Rings, and boil them till
it blows again; then take it from the Fire, and let it cool a little;

    Distinction only, that the Lemons ought to be pared twice over,

them he exclaimed, ""Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,

that Lewis XV. was extremely affected by these religious disputes. I

the quarrel; whereas with these even the spirit of reconciliation
contributes to encrease it. Marshal Saxe formerly said to me, that if he were to have gained an
advantage over the Tartars, he would have given them quarter; but that
if he had conquered an army of Theologians, he would have exterminated
them without mercy. A man of wit, and a great politician, was of opinion, that the

Christ is treated less fully than that of the earlier times, but its
importance to later European civilization has been so great that a
summary treatment of it should be included even in a book of such

sincere Christians, many faithful soldiers of the Cross. From the

Gospel found its way to the coasts of Britain, the greatest boon that
could be conferred on a nation. An unvarying Peeblesshire tradition, for
example, avers that among the first to witness for Christ and His truth
by the banks of the Tweed and its tributaries were Roman soldiers from
the great military station at Hall Lyne, and out of whose quiet
fellowship-meetings in the recesses of the Manor, sprang the church of
that valley, one of the oldest in the county, and dedicated to Saint
Gordian, either the Emperor of that name, or what is more likely,
""Gordian the well-beloved,"" Deputy of Gaul, who suffered martyrdom about
the year 362. Be that as it may, it is at any rate certain that long

the relics of a blessed saint. The Treaty of Peace was signed at Paris on March 30, 1856, and now all
hearts in the Crimea turned toward home. One by one the hospitals were

carried the same word, eland, to South Africa, and there gave it to the

"On his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former
associates, Jonson offered his services as a playwright to
Henslowe's rivals, the Lord Chamberlain's company, in which
Shakespeare was a prominent shareholder. A tradition of long
standing, though not susceptible of proof in a court of law,
narrates that Jonson had submitted the manuscript of ""Every Man in
His Humour"" to the Chamberlain's men and had received from the
company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back, read the play
himself, and at once accepted it. Whether this story is true or
not, certain it is that ""Every Man in His Humour"" was accepted by
Shakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with
Shakespeare taking a part. The evidence of this is contained in
the list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson's

they are not the most inflammable Things that can be imagined, and,

Now after that the truce with the Scots was expired, which tooke end at
the feast of All saints last past, the king sent the lord Iohn Segraue,
a right valiant knight (but not so circumspect in his gouernment as
was necessarie) with a great armie into Scotland, to haue the rule
of the land as lord warden of the same: with him was ioined also
Rafe Confreie, treasurer of the armie. These two capteins comming to
the borders, and hearing that the Scotishmen alreadie were in armes,
they entered into Scotland, and in order of battell passed foorth to
Edenburgh, and hearing nothing of their enimies which kept them still
in the mounteins, they deuided their armie into three seuerall battels,
two of the which came behind the fore ward vnder the leading of the
said Rafe Confreie, the third (that is to say) the fore ward, the
lord Segraue led himselfe, in such order that there was the distance
of foure miles betwixt their lodgings. This they did to be the more
plentiouslie serued of vittels. But the Scots vnderstanding this order of their enimies, became the
more hardie, and therevpon hauing knowledge where the lord Segraue was
lodged with his companie, a good way off from the other two parts of
the armie, they hasted forwards in the night season, and came neere
vnto the place where the same lord Segraue was incamped, a little
before daie, making themselues readie to assaile the Englishmen in
their campe. But the lord Segraue hauing knowledge of their comming,
though he was counselled by some of them that were about him, either
to withdraw vnto the other battels, or else to send vnto them to come
to his aid, he would follow neither of both the waies; but like a
capteine more hardie than wise in this point, disposed his companies

"c._ 11. XI. _MADAM,_

To your _Authors_ argument,[1] That _if Motion belong naturally to
Matter, Matter being Uniform, it must be alike moved in every part or
particle imaginable of it, by reason this Motion being natural and
essential to Matter, is alike every way._ I answer, That this is no
more necessary, then that the several actions of one body, or of one
part of a body should be alike; for though Matter is one and the same
in its Nature, and never changes, yet the motions are various, which
motions are the several actions of one and the same Natural Matter; and
this is the cause of so many several Creatures; for self-moving matter
by its self-moving power can act several ways, modes or manners; and
had not natural matter a self-acting power, there could not be any
variety in Nature; for Nature knows of no rest, there being no such
thing as rest in Nature; but she is in a perpetual motion, I mean
self-motion, given her from God: Neither do I think it Atheistical
(as your _Author_ deems) to maintain this opinion of self-motion, as
long as I do not deny the Omnipotency of God; but I should rather
think it Irreligious to make so many several Creatures as Immaterial
Spirits, like so many severall Deities, to rule and govern Nature and
all material substances in Nature; for what Atheism doth there lie
in saying, that natural matter is naturally moving, and wise in her
self? Doth this oppose the omnipotency and Infinite wisdom of God? It
rather proves and confirms it; for all Natures free power of moving and
wisdom is a gift of God, and proceeds from him; but I must confess,
it destroys the power of Immaterial substances, for Nature will not
be ruled nor governed by them, and to be against Natural Immaterial
substances, I think, is no Atheisme, except we make them Deities;
neither is Atheisme to contradict the opinion of those, that believe
such natural incorporeal Spirits, unless man make himself a God.",1600-1700,53679

moreover, sometimes grossly deficient in orthography; either as to the
manner of forming, or connecting, their letters when writing: at any
rate they should be taught to write straight, and in a character neat
and legible. A girl should know the grammar of her own language; not, however,
that she is to be taught by rule, as schoolboys are taught the Latin
language--but that she be used to distinguish the different tenses, in

                ESSAYS ON MANKIND AND POLITICAL ARITHMETIC


INTRODUCTION. WILLIAM PETTY, born on the 26th of May, 1623, was the son of a clothier
at Romsey in Hampshire. After education at the Romsey Grammar School, he
continued his studies at Caen in Normandy. There he supported himself by
a little trade while learning French, and advancing his knowledge of
Greek, Latin, Mathematics, and much else that belonged to his idea of a
liberal education. His idea was large.",1600-1700,5619
"To discover the art of
converting base into noble passions, or to obtain a universal remedy for
all mental diseases, is perhaps beyond the power of metaphysicians; but
in the pursuit useful discoveries may be made. As to Olivia's letters--I am sorry I sent them to you; for I see that
they have lowered, instead of raising her in your opinion. But if you
criticise letters, written in openness and confidence of heart to a
private friend, as if they were set before the tribunal of the public,
you are--may I say it?--not only severe, but unjust; for you try and
condemn the subjects of one country by the laws of another.",1800-1900,35638
"The disappearance of all save a few fragments of this book, and
of any writing answering in description to it, the impossibility of
identifying it with the present Gospel of Matthew, or of proving that
the existing Gospel of Matthew rests upon it;[10] the comparatively late
date to which our Greek Matthew must be assigned--thirty years at least,
probably fifty or sixty after Jesus' death, and the absolute failure of
all attempts to trace its records to an eye witness of any sort, (say
nothing of a competent eye witness, clear of head, tenacious of memory,
veracious in speech,) all conspire to stamp with imprudence the
conjecture that the Christ of Matthew and the Jesus of history were one
and the same. This would be the case were the picture harmoniously
proportioned, as it is not. [Footnote 10: The character and influence of the ""Gospel of the Hebrews""
and of other books of the same kind is considered in full by Mr. S.
Baring-Gould in ""The Lost and Hostile Gospels.""",1800-1900,36767
"6 There on a glorious throne, he reigns,
And by his power divine
Redeems us from the slavish chains
Of Satan, and of sin. 7 Thence shall the Lord to judgment come,
And, with a sovereign voice,
Shall call, and break up every tomb,
While waking saints rejoice. 8 O may I then with joy appear
Before the Judge's face,
And, with the blest assembly there,
Sing his redeeming grace! Song 4. _Praise for Mercies Spiritual and Temporal_.",1700-1800,13439
"IN the most ancient Times _Plagues_, like many other Diseases, were
looked upon as _divine Judgments_ sent to punish the Wickedness of
Mankind: and therefore the only Defence sought after was by Sacrifices
and Lustrations to appease the Anger of incensed Heaven. [15]

HOW much soever may be said to justify Reflexions of this Kind, since we
are assured from sacred History, that divine Vengeance has been
sometimes executed by _Plagues_; yet it is certain, that such
Speculations pushed too far, were then attended with ill Consequences,
by obstructing Inquiries into natural Causes, and encouraging a supine
Submission to those Evils: against which the infinitely good and wise
Author of Nature has in most Cases provided proper Remedies. UPON this Account, in After-Ages, when the Profession of Physick came to
be founded upon the Knowledge of Nature, _Hippocrates_ strenuously
opposed this Opinion, that _some particular Sicknesses were Divine, or
sent immediately from the Gods_; and affirmed, that _no Diseases came
more from the Gods than others, all coming from them, and yet all owning
their proper natural Causes: that the Sun, Cold, and Winds were_ divine;
_the Changes of which, and their Influences on human Bodies, were
diligently to be considered by a Physician_.",1700-1800,32171
"The point was, how to cause that ruction."" There was more than passing interest on the faces of his followers. In
their opinion this leader of theirs was a fine fellow, a cunning man,

at a stroke, about 1880, with the introduction by the Parisian

thermometer combining the simplest form of instrument with the simplest
form of registration (see fig. 16). This innovation, which fixed the
form of the conventional registering instrument until the advent of the
radiosonde, seems to have stemmed from a source quite outside
meteorology--the technology of the steam gauge. Richard's thermometric
element was the curved metal tube of elliptical cross-section that
Bourdon had developed several decades earlier as a steam gauge. Pressure
within such a tube causes it to straighten, and thus to move a pointer

"In naming it a mute instrument, I distinguish it from what
delivers the speech by a sound, such as a trumpet in music, or the
mouths of others.] The second point of the minor is: that the counterfeiter undertakes
the author's business, not only without any permission from the owner,
but even contrary to the owner's will. Given that he is a
counterfeiter because he invades the province of another, who is
authorized by the author himself to publish the work: the question is,
whether the author can confer the same permission on yet another, and
consent thereto. It is, however, clear that, as then each of them--the
first editor and the person afterwards usurping the publication of the
work (the counterfeiter)--would manage the author's business with one
and the same public, the labour of the one must render that of the
other useless and be ruinous to both; therefore a contract between the
author and an editor that contains the corollary, to allow yet another
besides the editor to venture the publication of the author's work, is
impossible; consequently the author was not entitled to give the
permission to any other, [including by implication a] counterfeiter),
and the counterfeiter should not have even presumed this; by
consequence the counterfeiting of books is a business totally contrary
to the will of the proprietor, and yet undertaken in the proprietor's

authorized by him, suffers damages.",1700-1800,46060

restored Italian poetry to its former splendour. About this period,
1468, Lorenzo became enamoured, or rather fancied himself enamoured, of

size of the lark woodpecker, or turtle-dove, although his wings are

in length, black, curved at the base, and sharply pointed: the chops
are the same in length; around the base of the beak, including the eye
and a small part of the throat, there is a fine crimson red: the neck,
as low down as the crook in front, is of an iron gray: the belly and
breast present a curious mixture of white and blood-red, which has much
the appearance of paint, where the red predominates: the top of the
head, back, sides, and upper surface of the wings and tail, exhibit
the appearance of a glossy green, in a certain exposure to the light:

equipped with ten feathers, sharply pointed, and those in the centre
the longest, being about two and a half inches in length: the tongue
is barbed and pointed, and of an elastic and cartilagenous substance:
the eye is rather large, the pupil black, and the iris of a dark and
yellowish brown: the bird in its actions when flying, resembles the
small red-headed woodpecker common to the United States, and likewise
in its notes: the pointed tail renders essential service when the bird
is sitting and retaining his resting position against the perpendicular
sides of a tree: the legs and feet are black, and covered with wide
imbricated scales: he has four toes on each foot, two in the rear and

justification does not depend on our works, although good works neither
can nor ought to be absent, just as we cannot exist without food and
drink and all the functions of this mortal body. Still it is not on them

"Miss Mancel's person was so uncommonly fine, that she could not be long
settled in the country without attracting general notice. Though the
lower rank of people may be less refined in their ideas, yet her beauty
was so very striking, that it did not escape their admiration, and the
handsome lady, as they called her, became the general subject of
discourse. As church was the only place where she exposed to public
view, she had from the first endeavoured to elude observation, by
mingling in the crowd, and sitting in the most obscure seat; but when
fame had awakened the curiosity of those of higher rank, she was easily
distinguished, and in a short time many inhabitants of the neighbouring
parishes came to that church to see her. She more than answered every
expectation; for such perfection of beauty scarcely ever came out of the
hands of nature. Many ladies in the neighbourhood introduced themselves
to her, and found her behaviour as enchanting as her person.",1700-1800,26050

disordered to stay till the conclusion of the feast, she ordered them to

"If he who struck him, though he did so sneakingly and
treacherously, had drawn his sword and stood and faced him, then he who
had been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time;
offence because he was struck treacherously, insult because he who struck
him maintained what he had done, standing his ground without taking to
flight. And so, according to the laws of the accursed duel, I may have
received offence, but not insult, for neither women nor children can
maintain it, nor can they wound, nor have they any way of standing their
ground, and it is just the same with those connected with religion; for
these three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive, and
so, though naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no
right to offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received
offence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult can
still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do I
feel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had
stayed a little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he makes
in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any
knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his countless

you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before
that lady and tell her what I have done to set you free."" One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was
listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would
not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El
Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad
Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, ""Begone, caballero, and
ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,
slayest thee as art here a Biscayan."" Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, ""If
thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy
folly and rashness, miserable creature."" To which the Biscayan returned,
""I no gentleman!--I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou

hopes that this intermediary would return with the result he
desired. However things had gone too far for the allied
sovereigns to treat with Napoleon, from whom such a plea denoted
the weakness of his position. So, although unable to conquer us
on the 16th, they hoped to overcome us by a renewed effort with
their superior numbers, and relied heavily on the defection of

"I much fear your correspondent HENRY H. BREEN suggests an alteration in
Sir Charles Sedley's couplet more favourable to the witty baronet's
principles than facts will admit. It is too probable that he conceived
the sentiment just as it stands; for we must remember that he belonged
to that school of loose wits of the Restoration, who, ""Regis ad
exemplar,"" made a mock of all which tended to place ""virtue"" above
""interest,"" or to make men ""too fond of the right to pursue the
expedient."" Charles II. and his long train of licentious courtiers now stand at the
bar of history, and the verdict on him must be, that if he had a
principle in latter life it was this,--that he would never endanger
himself for any abstract rule of right; or as Sir W. Scott, in
_Peveril_, accurately says: ""he had sworn never to kiss the block on
which his father suffered,"" when yielding to the current would save him
from it; hence, there is too good reason to think that, in his
estimation, and in the judgment of the school he formed, ""loyalty"" was
""folly,"" and to take the strongest side ""wisdom."" The reference in Sedley's couplet to the line--

      ""Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni""--

is too obvious to need notice; and it is but too certain that in the
estimation of a courtier of Charles II., Cato dying for his country

slide out, and to be put in any side uppermost, in order to bring those

"He married four times--Reginald, the only
child of his fourth marriage, having the further privilege of being his
only son. The boy was delicate and of a strumous habit. This fact,
combined with his parents' ingrained conviction that a public school is
synonymous, morally speaking, with a common sewer, caused his education
to be conducted at home by a series of tutors as undistinguished by
birth as by scholarship--tentative apologetic young men, the goal of
whose ambitions was a wife and a curacy, failing which they resigned
themselves to the post of usher in some ultra-Protestant school. Sport
in all its forms, art and literature, being alike forbidden, the boy's
hungry energy had found no reasonable outlet. He had been miserable,
peevish, ailing, until at barely eighteen--after a discreditable
episode with a scullery-maid--he had been shipped off to New York to
learn business in the house of certain brokers and bill-discounters
with whom Messrs. Barking Brothers had extensive financial relations.",1900-2000,8569
"Some write that the said sir Gilbert was put to death for robbing
two cardinals, to wit, Gancellino the popes chancellour, and Lucas

consecrate the foresaid Lewes Beaumont bishop of Durham, and to intreat
a peace betwixt the realms of England and Scotland, and also to make an
agreement betwixt the king and the earle of Lancaster. The which being
met with vpon Winglesdon moore in Yorkeshire by the said Gilbert, were
robbed of such stuffe & treasure as they brought with them, but yet
escaped themselues and came to Durham, and from thence sent messengers
to Robert Bruce, to persuade him to some agreement. But whereas he
would not condescend to any reasonable conditions of peace at that
time, they determined to go into Scotland to talke with him themselues:
but before they came to the borders, king Robert, who iudged it not to
stand with his profit to haue any peace in that season, sent certeine
of his people to forbid the cardinals the entrie of his realme. The
cardinals being thus iniuriouslie handled, pronounced the Scots by
their legantine power accursed; and interdicted their whole realme.",1483-1600,46669
"THE HOME-COMING


In the spring of the year 528, a small brig used to run as a passenger
boat between Chalcedon on the Asiatic shore and Constantinople. On the
morning in question, which was that of the feast of Saint George, the
vessel was crowded with excursionists who were bound for the great city
in order to take part in the religious and festive celebrations which
marked the festival of the Megalo-martyr, one of the most choice
occasions in the whole vast hagiology of the Eastern Church. The day was
fine and the breeze light, so that the passengers in their holiday mood
were able to enjoy without a qualm the many objects of interest which
marked the approach to the greatest and most beautiful capital in the
world. On the right, as they sped up the narrow strait, there stretched the
Asiatic shore, sprinkled with white villages and with numerous villas
peeping out from the woods which adorned it. In front of them, the
Prince's Islands, rising as green as emeralds out of the deep sapphire
blue of the Sea of Marmora, obscured for the moment the view of the
capital.",1900-2000,8727
"The seventh book is the thrilling tale of the
formidable rising of all the Gauls against their conquerors, under the
leadership of Vercingetorix, an Arvernian chief. This man was a real
hero,--brave, patriotic, resourceful, perhaps the only worthy antagonist

and the disciplined valor of his legions. The Gauls nearly succeeded in
undoing all the work of six years, in destroying the Roman army and in
throwing off the Roman yoke.",1800-1900,28684

"Nor is the contemplation of the Divine Providence less useful than
delightful when we see nature, in her work of evolving the fœtus,
furnishing it with sustenance adapted to its varying ages and powers,
now more easy, by and by more difficult of digestion. For as the fœtus
acquires greater powers of digesting, so is it supplied with food that
is successively thicker and harder. And the same thing may be observed
in the milk of animals generally: when the young creature first sees the
light the milk is thinner and more easy of concoction; but in the course
of time, and with increased strength in the suckling, it becomes
thicker, and is more abundantly stored with caseous matter. Those flabby
and delicate women, therefore, who do not nurse their own children, but
give them up to the breast of another, consult their health
indifferently; for mercenary nurses being for the major part of more
robust and hardy frames, and their milk consequently thicker, more
caseous, and difficult of digestion, it frequently happens that milk of
this kind given to the infants of such parents, particularly during the
time of teething, is not well borne, but gives rise to crudities and
diarrhœas, to griping, vomiting, fever, epilepsy, and other formidable
diseases of the like nature. What Fabricius says,[316] and strives to bolster up by certain
reasonings, of the chalazæ standing for the matter of the chick, we have
already thrown out in our history, and at the same time have made it
manifest that the substance of the chick and its first rudiments were
produced whilst the chalazæ were still entire and unchanged, and in a
totally different situation.",1700-1800,58857

was overheard saying to his son, a Chevalier of St. Louis, ""_Chevalier,

winds as a compass card both originated in the Mediterranean. The
pivotted needle is described in the Epistle of Peter Peregrinus,

"But Sister Maria Celeste's
letters to her father have happily been preserved, and most touching
these letters are. We can hardly read them without thinking how the
sweet and gentle nun would have shrunk from the idea of their
publication. Her loving little notes to her ""dearest lord and father,"" as she used
affectionately to call Galileo, were almost invariably accompanied by
some gift, trifling it may be, but always the best the poor nun had
to bestow. The tender grace of these endearing communications was
all the more precious to him from the fact that the rest of Galileo's
relatives were of quite a worthless description. He always
acknowledged the ties of his kindred in the most generous way, but
their follies and their vices, their selfishness and their
importunities, were an incessant source of annoyance to him, almost
to the last day of his life.",1800-1900,2298

"Albeit the Assembling, Continuing, and Dissoluing of Parliaments, be
a Prerogatiue so peculiarly belonging to Our Imperiall Crowne, and
the times and seasons thereof so absolutelie in our owne power, that
Wee neede not giue account thereof vnto any: yet, according to Our
continuall custome, to make Our good Subiects acquainted with the
reasons of all Our publike resolutions and actions, We haue thought
it expedient at this time to declare, not onely Our pleasure and
resolution therein, grounded vpon mature deliberation, with the aduice
and vniforme consent of Our whole Priuie Councell; but therewith also
to note some especiall proceedings moouing Vs to this resolution: And
that chieflie to this end, that as God, so the World may witnesse with
Vs, that it was Our intent to haue made this the happiest Parliament
that euer was in Our time: And that the lettes and impediments
thereof being discerned, all misunderstandings and iealousies might
be remooued, and all Our people may know and beleeue, that Wee are as
farre from imputing any of those ill accidents, that haue happened
in Parliament, to any want or neglect of duty, or good affection
towards Vs, by them in generall, or by the greater and better number of
Parliament men, as We are confident (the true causes discouered) they
wilbe farre from imputing it to any default in Vs; there hauing in the
beginning of this late Assemblie passed greater and more infallible
tokens of loue and duty from Our Subiects to Vs their Soueraigne, and
more remarkeable testimonies from Vs of Our Princely care and zeale of
their welfare, then haue beene in any Parliament met in any former Age. This Parliament was by Vs called, as for making good and profitable
Lawes, so more especially, in this time of miserable distraction
throughout Christendome, for the better setling of peace and Religion,
and restoring Our Children to their ancient and lawfull patrimony,
which We attempted to procure by peaceable treaty, at Our owne
excessiue charge, thereby to saue and preuent the effusion of Christian
blood, the miserable effect of warre, and dissension; yet with full
purpose, if that succeeded not, to recouer it by the sword; and
therfore, as a necessary meanes conducing to those ends, the supply of
Our Treasures was to bee prouided for. This Parliament beginning in Ianuary last, proceeded some moneths with
such harmonie betweene Vs and Our people, as cannot bee paralleld by
any former time: For as the House of Commons at the first, both in
the manner of their supplie, and otherwise, shewed greater loue, and
more respect then euer any House of Commons did to Vs, or (as Wee
thinke) to any King before Vs: So Wee, vpon all their complaints,
haue afforded them such memorable and rare examples of Iustice, as
many ages past cannot shew the like; wherein, that Wee preferred
the weale of Our people before all particular respects, the things
themselues doe sufficiently prooue, Our Iustice being extended, not
onely to persons of ordinary ranke and qualitie, but euen to the prime
Officer of Our Kingdome. And although, after their first Recesse at
Easter, Wee found that they misspent a great deale of time, rather
vpon the inlarging of the limites of their liberties, and diuers other
curious, and vnprofitable things, then vpon the framing and proponing
of good and profitable Lawes: Yet Wee gaue them time and scope for
their Parliamentary proceedings, and prolonged the Session to an
vnusuall length, continuing it vntill the eight and twentieth day of
May, before Wee signified Our purpose for their Recesse; and then Wee
declared, that Wee would make a Recesse on the fourth day of Iune next
following, but only for a time, and in such maner, as might bee without
disturbance to any their businesses in hand, expressing out of Our
Grace (though We needed not) the causes of that Our purpose, which were
the season of the yeere, vsually hot, and vnfit for great assemblies,
Our Progresse approaching, the necessitie Wee had to make vse of
Our Councell attending in both houses, both to settle Our waightie
affaires of State before Wee went, and to attend Vs when Wee went Our
Progresse, the disfurnishing of Our ordinary Courts of Iustice so many
Termes together, the long absence of Iustices of Peace, and Deputy
Lieuetenants, whose presence was needfull for making and returning of
musters, and for subordinate gouernement of the Countrey; and therefore
We appointed to adiourne the Parliament on the fourth day of Iune,
giuing that warning longer then vsuall, that they might set in order
their businesses, and prepare their greeuances, which Wee promised both
to heare and answer before that Recesse, for presenting whereof Wee

"_EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY FROM THE PRE-NEBULAR CONDITION OF THE
    UNIVERSE._


The nebular hypothesis, strictly speaking, is one simply intended to
account for the origin of our solar system. “It is,” as remarks
Professor A. Winchell, “primarily a genetic explanation of the phenomena
of the solar system; and accessorily a co-ordination, in a common
conception, of the principal phenomena in the stellar and nebular
firmament, as far as human vision has been able to penetrate.”[62] The
theory starts with the assumption that all the materials composing the
solar system once existed in a state of extreme tenuity and diffusion,
filling far more than the entire space included within the orbit of the
most remote planet. It begins with this diffused nebulous mass tending
slowly, under the influence of gravitation, towards a state of
aggregation.",1800-1900,49200

annually ‘performed’ upon this anniversary; and, accordingly, the promise
being claimed, silence was obtained, and she, with all that show of
tucker-heaving diffidence which is so becoming in a pretty plump
downy-cheeked girl, prepared to commence the venerable chaunt, when a
noise resembling that produceable by the falling of an eight-and-forty
pound shot, echoed through the house. It appeared to descend from the

sins, and thence be converted to penitence and to a better manner of
life. But we must not stop here; that would be to wound only and not to
bind up, to strike and not to heal, to kill and not to make alive, to
bring down to hell and not to bring back, to humble and not to exalt. Therefore the word of grace and of the promised remission of sin must

THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA


                        IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776


The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to
secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any Form of
Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form,
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should
not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all
experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to
reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such
is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems
of Government.",1600-1700,16780
"So much of it as is here given to the public, she was
far from considering as finished, and, in a letter to a friend directly
written on this subject, she says, ""I am perfectly aware that some of
the incidents ought to be transposed, and heightened by more harmonious
shading; and I wished in some degree to avail myself of criticism,
before I began to adjust my events into a story, the outline of which
I had sketched in my mind. ""* The only friends to whom the author
communicated her manuscript, were Mr. Dyson, the translator of the
Sorcerer, and the present editor; and it was impossible for the most
inexperienced author to display a stronger desire of profiting by the
censures and sentiments that might be suggested. **

     * A more copious extract of this letter is subjoined to the
     author's preface. ** The part communicated consisted of the first fourteen
     chapters. In revising these sheets for the press, it was necessary for the editor,
in some places, to connect the more finished parts with the pages of an
older copy, and a line or two in addition sometimes appeared requisite
for that purpose.",1700-1800,134

"""Wait a little longer, my lads,"" was the
duke's reply to the murmur which reached him from some of his troops
who had suffered heavily from the French fire and were anxious to
charge, ""and you shall have your wish."" Once when the fire was concentrated on the spot where he was with
his staff he told them to separate a little, so as to afford a less
conspicuous mark for the enemy. At another time, when some German troops hesitated to advance against
the French, the duke put himself at their head. When Napoleon's Old Guard was advancing up the hill, the only sight
they could see was the duke and a few mounted officers, till a voice
was heard, ""Up, guards, and at them!""",1800-1900,10024
"Master indeed of the knowledge of all noble living and of the wisdom of
all spiritual things will he be to us ever, seeing that it was he who by
the magic of his presence and the music of his lips taught us at Oxford
that enthusiasm for beauty which is the secret of Hellenism, and that
desire for creation which is the secret of life, and filled some of us,
at least, with the lofty and passionate ambition to go forth into far
and fair lands with some message for the nations and some mission for
the world, and yet in his art criticism, his estimate of the joyous
element of art, his whole method of approaching art, we are no longer
with him; for the keystone to his aesthetic system is ethical always. He
would judge of a picture by the amount of noble moral ideas it
expresses; but to us the channels by which all noble work in painting
can touch, and does touch, the soul are not those of truths of life or
metaphysical truths. To him perfection of workmanship seems but the
symbol of pride, and incompleteness of technical resource the image of
an imagination too limitless to find within the limits of form its
complete expression, or of a love too simple not to stammer in its tale.",1900-2000,35903
"Our segundo had triple

himself in this dispute, and greatly so, is alone sufficient motive for
my giving some account of it. A native of Spain, named Molina, in the fullness of his knowledge, took

"But now that the Critique has shown by that
deduction, first, that they are not of empirical origin, but have
their seat and source a priori in the pure understanding; secondly,
that as they refer to objects in general independently of the
intuition of them, hence, although they cannot effect theoretical
knowledge, except in application to empirical objects, yet when
applied to an object given by pure practical reason they enable us
to conceive the supersensible definitely, only so far, however, as
it is defined by such predicates as are necessarily connected with the
pure practical purpose given a priori and with its possibility. The
speculative restriction of pure reason and its practical extension
bring it into that relation of equality in which reason in general can
be employed suitably to its end, and this example proves better than
any other that the path to wisdom, if it is to be made sure and not to
be impassable or misleading, must with us men inevitably pass
through science; but it is not till this is complete that we can be
convinced that it leads to this goal. {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 85}

"Not tradition and not theory, but
a simple impartial study of the development of Paul's central line of
thought, brings us to the conclusion, that from the very outset of the
Epistle, where Paul speaks of Christ as 'declared to be the son of God
with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the
dead,'[78] to the very end, the essential sense in which Paul uses the
term _resurrection_ is that of a rising, in this visible earthly
existence, from the death of obedience to blind selfish impulse, to the
life of obedience to the eternal moral order;--in Christ's case first,
as the pattern for us to follow; in the believer's case afterwards, as
following Christ's pattern through identifying himself with him. [Footnote 78: _Rom._, i, 4.] We have thus reached Paul's fundamental conception without even a
glimpse of the fundamental conceptions of Puritanism, which,
nevertheless, professes to have learnt its doctrine from St. Paul and
from his Epistle to the Romans. Once, for a moment, the term _faith_
brought us in contact with the doctrine of Puritanism, but only to see
that the essential sense given to this word by Paul Puritanism had
missed entirely. Other parts, then, of the Epistle to the Romans than
those by which we have been occupied must have chiefly fixed the
attention of Puritanism.",1800-1900,54793

"Where laws discriminated at all, it was
almost always against rather than in favor of women; and this was true
to a much greater extent in Europe and elsewhere than in the United
States. Dru had a profound sympathy for the effort women were making to
get upon an equality with men in the race for life: and he believed that
with the franchise would come equal opportunity and equal pay for the
same work. America, he hoped, might again lead in the uplift of the sex, and the
example would be a distinct gain to women in those less forward
countries where they were still largely considered as inferior to and
somewhat as chattels to man. Then, too, Dru had an infinite pity for the dependent and submerged
life of the generality of women.",1900-2000,6711
"If any doubt of the correspondence of the angles of mountains remains,
I appeal to the sight of every man who makes the observation. Every

"These two wee cannot
passe: for though wee may passe the latter, yet are wee not able to
arriue vnto the former: I am of opinion that a wise man may in this

seeing that this aptnesse extendeth it selfe to immortalitie, as it
was before sinne, and shall bee after the resurrection. But if you
say, that neither _Aristotle_, _Plato_, _Hippocrates_, nor _Galen_,
attained hereto. I aunswere, that they were ignoraunt euen of manye
meane vertues, which afterwarde were familiar to those that were
studious. These therefore might easily bee hidden from them, though
they laboured to finde them out: but they busied themselues too much
in other matters, and waxed olde in a trice, spending their life in
base and vulgar things, and yet they were acquainted with many secrets. For we knowe that _Aristotle_ sayth in the _Predicaments_, that the
quadrature of a Circle may bee knowne, although it bee not yet knowne.",1483-1600,58393
"Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the
owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in
search of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those
mountains before he found him, and so he directed Sancho to take a short
cut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other,
and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed
so quickly out of their sight. ""I could not do that,"" said Sancho, ""for when I separate from your
worship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of
panics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this
time forth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence."" ""It shall be so,"" said he of the Rueful Countenance, ""and I am very glad
that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail thee,
even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind me
slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us
make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that
we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found."" To which Sancho made answer, ""Far better would it be not to look for him,
for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it is
plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that without
taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in
some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be
discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then
the king will hold me harmless."" ""Thou art wrong there, Sancho,"" said Don Quixote, ""for now that we have a
suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound
to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strong
suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he
were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him give thee any
uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.""",1600-1700,5910

Murad Beg of Kunduz. Amongst them all political intrigue was in a

from Western Afghanistan knew himself to be unpopular with the Amir
Dost Mahomed Khan, and had shrewd suspicions that spite of a
long-tried friendship, he was regarded as a dangerous factor in Kabul
politics. Yezdambaksh, influenced doubtless by his gallant wife, who
rode and fought by his side and was ever at his elbow in council,
trimmed his course to patch up a temporary alliance with Haji Khan

So weak and languishing, as not to have even wishing left to him
Socrates kept a confounded scolding wife
Socrates: According to what a man can
Soft, easy, and wholesome pillow is ignorance and incuriosity
Solon said that eating was physic against the malady hunger
Solon, that none can be said to be happy until he is dead
some people rude, by being overcivil  in their courtesy
Some wives covetous indeed, but very few that are good managers
Sometimes the body first submits to age, sometimes the mind
Souls that are regular and strong of themselves are rare
Sparing and an husband of his knowledge
Speak less of one's self than what one really is is folly
Spectators can claim no interest in the honour and pleasure
Stilpo lost wife, children, and goods
Stilpo: thank God, nothing was lost of his

Studied, when young, for ostentation, now for diversion
Studies, to teach me to do, and not to write
Study makes me sensible how much I have to learn
Study of books is a languishing and feeble motion
Study to declare what is justice, but never took care to do it
Stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite number of lies
Stupidity and facility natural to the common people
Style wherewith men establish religions and laws
Subdividing these subtilties we teach men to increase their doubt
Such a recipe as they will not take themselves

Suffer those inconveniences which are not possibly to be avoided
Sufficiently covered by their virtue without any other robe
Suicide: a morsel that is to be swallowed without chewing
Superstitiously to seek out in the stars the ancient causes
Swell and puff up their souls, and their natural way of speaking
Swim in troubled waters without fishing in them
Take a pleasure in being uninterested in other men's affairs
Take all things at the worst, and to resolve to bear that worst
Take my last leave of every place I depart from
Take two sorts of grist out of the same sack
Taking things upon trust from vulgar opinion
Taught to be afraid of professing our ignorance
Taught to consider sleep as a resemblance of death

Testimony of the truth from minds prepossessed by custom? That he could neither read nor swim
That looks a nice well-made shoe to you
That we may live, we cease to live
That which cowardice itself has chosen for its refuge
The action is commendable, not the man
The age we live in produces but very indifferent things
The authors, with whom I converse
The Babylonians carried their sick into the public square
The best authors too much humble and discourage me
The Bible: the wicked and ignorant grow worse by it
The cause of truth ought to be the common cause
The conduct of our lives is the true mirror of our doctrine
The consequence of common examples
The day of your birth is one day's advance towards the grave
The deadest deaths are the best
The event often justifies a very foolish conduct
The faintness that surprises in the exercises of Venus
The gods sell us all the goods they give us
The good opinion of the vulgar is injurious
The honour we receive from those that fear us is not honour
The ignorant return from the combat full of joy and triumph
The impulse of nature, which is a rough counsellor
The last informed is better persuaded than the first
The mean is best
The mind grows costive and thick in growing old
The most manifest sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness
The most voluntary death is the finest
The particular error first makes the public error
The pedestal is no part of the statue
The privilege of the mind to rescue itself from old age
The reward of a thing well done is to have done it
The satiety of living, inclines a man to desire to die
The sick man has not to complain who has his cure in his sleeve
The storm is only begot by a concurrence of angers
The thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear
The very name Liberality sounds of Liberty
The vice opposite to curiosity is negligence
The virtue of the soul does not consist in flying high
Their disguises and figures only serve to cosen fools
Their labour is not to delivery, but about conception
Their pictures are not here who were cast away
Their souls seek repose in agitation
There are defeats more triumphant than victories
There are some upon whom their rich clothes weep
There can be no pleasure to me without communication
There is more trouble in keeping money than in getting it
There is no allurement like modesty, if it be not rude
There is no long, nor short, to things that are no more
There is no merchant that always gains
There is no reason that has not its contrary
There is no recompense becomes virtue
There is none of us who would not be worse than kings
There is nothing I hate so much as driving a bargain
There is nothing like alluring the appetite and affections
There is nothing single and rare in respect of nature
These sleepy, sluggish sort of men are often the most dangerous
They (good women) are not by the dozen, as every one knows
They begin to teach us to live when we have almost done living
They better conquer us by flying
They buy a cat in a sack
They can neither lend nor give anything to one another
They do not see my heart, they see but my countenance
They err as much who too much forbear Venus
They gently name them, so they patiently endure them (diseases)
They have heard, they have seen, they have done so and so
They have not one more invention left wherewith to amuse us
They have not the courage to suffer themselves to be corrected
They have yet touched nothing of that which is mine
They juggle and trifle in all their discourses at our expense
They must be very hard to please, if they are not contented
They must become insensible and invisible to satisfy us
They neither instruct us to think well nor to do well
They never loved them till dead
They who would fight custom with grammar are triflers
Thing at which we all aim, even in virtue is pleasure
Things grow familiar to men's minds by being often seen
Things I say are better than those I write
Things often appear greater to us at distance than near at hand
Things seem greater by imagination than they are in effect
Things that engage us elsewhere and separate us from ourselves
Think myself no longer worth my own care
Think of physic as much good or ill as any one would have me
Thinking nothing done, if anything remained to be done
Thinks nothing profitable that is not painful
This decay of nature which renders him useless, burdensome
This plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other
Those immodest and debauched tricks and postures
Those oppressed with sorrow sometimes surprised by a smile
Those which we fear the least are, peradventure, most to be fear
Those who can please and hug themselves in what they do
Those within (marriage) despair of getting out
Thou diest because thou art living
Thou wilt not feel it long if thou feelest it too much
Though I be engaged to one forme, I do not tie the world unto it
Though nobody should read me, have I wasted time
Threats of the day of judgment
Thucydides: which was the better wrestler
Thy own cowardice is the cause, if thou livest in pain
'Tis all swine's flesh, varied by sauces
'Tis an exact life that maintains itself in due order in private
'Tis better to lean towards doubt than assurance--Augustine
'Tis evil counsel that will admit no change
'Tis far beyond not fearing death to taste and relish it
'Tis for youth to subject itself to common opinions
'Tis impossible to deal fairly with a fool
'Tis in some sort a kind of dying to avoid the pain of living well
'Tis more laudable to obey the bad than the good
'Tis no matter; it may be of use to some others
'Tis not the cause, but their interest, that inflames them
'Tis not the number of men, but the number of good men
'Tis said of Epimenides, that he always prophesied backward
'Tis so I melt and steal away from myself
'Tis the sharpness of our mind that gives the edge to our pains
'Tis then no longer correction, but revenge
'Tis there she talks plain French
Titillation of ill-natured pleasure in seeing others suffer
Title of barbarism to everything that is not familiar
Titles being so dearly bought
Titles of my chapters do not always comprehend the whole matter
To be a slave, incessantly to be led by the nose by one's self
To be, not to seem
To condemn them as impossible, is by a temerarious presumption
To contemn what we do not comprehend
To die of old age is a death rare, extraordinary, and singular
To do well where there was danger was the proper office
To forbear doing is often as generous as to do
To forbid us anything is to make us have a mind to't
To fret and vex at folly, as I do, is folly itself
To give a currency to his little pittance of learning
To go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word
To keep me from dying is not in your power
To kill men, a clear and strong light is required
To know by rote, is no knowledge
To make little things appear great was his profession
To make their private advantage at the public expense
To smell, though well, is to stink
To study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one's self to die
To what friend dare you intrust your griefs
To whom no one is ill who can be good?",1483-1600,7551

the usual preponderance of volcanic materials, contains in addition
fragments of Silurian limestone (crowded with characteristic fossils),
and pieces of Landovery grit and shale. According to Sir Andrew Ramsay,[60] this Permian breccia is probably
of glacial origin, its materials having been brought down by ice
in Permian times from the neighbourhood of the Longmynd in central
Shropshire, where all the formations represented in its derived rock
fragments occur at present in natural juxtaposition. According to
Professor Jukes,[61] the fragments of the Northfield breccia, at any
rate, “may have been derived from adjacent rocks, now concealed under
the Permian and New Red Sandstone.”

himself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the senor his
master have been."" ""Yes, I will,"" said Sancho, in a great rage; ""but I'd like it to be with
cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands; for there's not so
much difference between me and my master that he should be washed with
angels' water and I with devil's lye. The customs of countries and
princes' palaces are only good so long as they give no annoyance; but the
way of washing they have here is worse than doing penance. I have a clean
beard, and I don't require to be refreshed in that fashion, and whoever
comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head, I mean to say my beard, with
all due respect be it said, I'll give him a punch that will leave my fist

jokes than the polite attentions of one's host."" The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho's rage and

knowledge that others look to us for advice and help. When the terrified
Miss Blake rushed into her aunt’s cabin, it must be said to the widow’s
credit that she left off screaming, and endeavored to pacify her niece. She tried to think what Captain Evans would have done in such an

most effectual for accomplishing their purpose of setting Europe in
a flame."" ""But much expence,"" says the speaker, ""will attend it,
and much has already been employed, which cannot be named because
it is given in secret."" The Assembly had given the Illumination

"The worst of all educational methods are
threats. The only effective admonitions are short and infrequent ones. The greatest skill in the educator is to be silent for the moment and
then so reprove the fault, indirectly, that the child is brought to
correct himself or make himself the object of blame. This can be done
by the instructor telling something that causes the child to compare his
own conduct with the hateful or admirable types of behaviour about which
he hears information.",1800-1900,988
"Some painters think that this is too much trouble and assert
that they cannot get paid for doing work in this way, but in the end it
will prove to be the best way, as it will greatly add to the appearance
and durability of any job so to prepare it. In any case the work should
be thoroughly sand-papered and made as smooth as possible before
receiving the first coat; this, of course, is for old work. The
ground-color should be thinned with about half spirits of turpentine
and half oil, with the addition of sufficient drier for old work, and
oil, with an extra quantity of drier, for first coat on new work, using
some spirits for the second and third coats. The writer has found by experience that on the cheapest jobs (of
two-coat work) where the wood is sappy and the work has been rendered
rough by the painter using a large quantity of drier in his priming
coat, a much better surface is made to grain over by this method. It
will not spot or look cloudy when rubbed in to grain, as two-coat work
often does on new wood.",1700-1800,41749

endeuoured to finde out wayes, not onelye agaynst the defect of euery
particular mans regiment, but also agaynst the corruption of Parents:
not that men should be able to reach vnto the life of _Adam_, or
_Artephius_, by reason of the corruption which daily encreaseth, but
that they might prolong their liues for a hundred yeares or somewhat
more, beyonde the common age of men now liuing, so that the diseases
vsually accompanying olde age, might bee kept backe for a time, and
though not vtterly prohibited and taken quite away, yet they might be
mittigated and diminished, that the life might be profitably prolonged
beyonde the expectation of men, but alwayes within the vtmost bounds

"In the whole assembly now there only appeared two faces that did not
glow with transport. Mr Thornhill's assurance had entirely forsaken him:
he now saw the gulph of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take
the plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a
voice of piercing misery implored compassion. Sir William was going to
spurn him away, but at my request he raised him, and after pausing a
few moments, 'Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude,' cried he, 'deserve no
tenderness; yet thou shalt not be entirely forsaken, a bare competence
shall be supplied, to support the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, shall be put in possession of a third part
of that fortune which once was thine, and from her tenderness alone thou

"The Duc d'Orleans acquainted the House, on the 29th, that Cardinal
Mazarin had arrived at Sedan; that Marechals de Hoquincourt and de la
Ferte were gone to join him with their army to bring him to Court; and
that it was high time to oppose his designs. Upon this it was
immediately resolved that deputies should be despatched forthwith to the
King; that the Cardinal and all his adherents should be declared guilty
of high treason; that the common people should be commanded to treat them
as such wherever they met them; that his library and all his household
goods should be sold, and that 150,000 livres premium should be given to
any man who should deliver up the said Cardinal, either dead or alive. Upon this expression all the ecclesiastics retired, for the reason above
mentioned. A new decree was passed on the 2d of January, 1652, wherein it was
decided that all the Parliaments of France should be invited to issue
their decrees against Mazarin, conformable to the last; that two more
councillors should be added to the four sent to guard the rivers and to
arm the common people; and that the troops of the Duc d'Orleans should

the continued wasting effect of the vast volumes of descending water
only by their thick mantle of accumulated vegetation, and were it not
for this protection the many months of continuous annual rain would
long ago have produced a leveling effect that would have made
unnecessary the various attempts of man to pierce the Isthmian
mountains and form an artificial strait. The ridges are sometimes level for a short distance, but are generally
broken and are made up of a succession of well rounded peaks. These
peaks are always completely covered with trees and from the top of the

Sevi to the English nation as a whole was perhaps the disruption of
trade, in which Sevi's father was intimately involved, as the agent of
an English mercantile house. At the height of the furor, Jewish
merchants were dissolving businesses as well as unroofing their houses
in preparation for the return to Jerusalem. But the prime significance
for Evelyn--perhaps more than for Rycaut--is revealed in the instinctive

is true that by some subtile softening of the general heart at the

investigations, was enabled to give an entirely new direction to at
least two branches--and two of the most important branches--of what
now-a-days we call Biological Science. On the one hand, he founded
all our modern physiology by the discovery of the exact nature of the
motions of the heart, and of the course in which the blood is propelled
through the body; and, on the other, he laid the foundation of that
study of development which has been so much advanced of late years, and
which constitutes one of the great pillars of the doctrine of evolution. This doctrine, I need hardly tell you, is now tending to revolutionise
our conceptions of the origin of living things, exactly in the same

revolutionised the conceptions which men had previously entertained with
regard to physiological processes.",1600-1700,2939

"In
making use of a stern and conscientious Calvinist, like Maximilian de
Bethune, in his first assault upon the theological professor who now
stood in Elizabeth's place, he showed the exquisite tact which never
failed him. Toleration for the two religions which had political power,
perfect intolerance for all others; despotic forms of polity, except for
two little republics which were to be smothered with protection and never
left out of leading strings, a thorough recasting of governments and
races, a palingenesis of Europe, a nominal partition of its hegemony
between France and England, which was to be in reality absorbed by
France, and the annihilation of Austrian power east and west, these were
the vast ideas with which that teeming Bourbon brain was filled. It is
the instinct both of poetic and of servile minds to associate a sentiment
of grandeur with such fantastic dreams, but usually on condition that the

swamps into smoothness, lighting up the underwoods, overtopping the
pastures, lining the rural lanes, and rearing its great pinkish masses

the whole thing, which puts to shame those tenderer shrubs that shrink
before the progress of cultivation. There is the Rhododendron, for

Azalea, and looking more robust and woody than either: it once grew in
many localities in this region, and still lingers in a few, without
consenting either to die or to blossom, and there is only one remote

luxuriant flowers, waving white above the dark green leaves, and bearing

"Much of it may, indeed, be of
very trivial and unimportant value in comparison with the food of the
country, yet still it may be fairly considered as a part of its
revenue; and, therefore, the only point in which I should differ from
Dr Adam Smith is where he seems to consider every increase of the
revenue or stock of a society as an increase of the funds for the
maintenance of labour, and consequently as tending always to ameliorate
the condition of the poor. The fine silks and cottons, the laces, and other ornamental luxuries of
a rich country, may contribute very considerably to augment the
exchangeable value of its annual produce; yet they contribute but in a
very small degree to augment the mass of happiness in the society, and
it appears to me that it is with some view to the real utility of the
produce that we ought to estimate the productiveness or
unproductiveness of different sorts of labour. The French economists
consider all labour employed in manufactures as unproductive. Comparing
it with the labour employed upon land, I should be perfectly disposed
to agree with them, but not exactly for the reasons which they give.",1700-1800,4239

effects can be observed. Book 3, on the directive force of the magnet,
is full of most instructive experiments, in which the terrella figures
largely, relating to the question how one magnet influences another
and tends to make it point toward it. All this was leading up to the
theory of terrestrial magnetism; for we find him naming the parts of
his loadstone globes with poles, equator and meridians. In this book
he dilates on the observation that vertical iron rods, such as the
finial on the Church of St. John at Rimini, spontaneously acquired
magnetic properties.",1483-1600,45893

Princes with sympathetic qualities were not entirely lacking in the
seven centuries of Mohammedan dominion in India, and they shine forth
as points of light from the gloomy horror of this time, but they fade
out completely before the luminous picture of the man who governed
India for half a century (1556-1605) and by a wise, gentle and just
reign brought about a season of prosperity such as the land had never
experienced in the millenniums of its history. This man, whose memory
even to-day is revered by the Hindus, was a descendant of Baber, Abul

easily--only a drowsy stupor, through which she realized she was hungry,

Mowitza was the only one she happened to think of. She did not know

July 2, 1646, when, after payment of a heavy fine, his estate, which
had been sequestrated, was restored to him, and he received pardon by
an ordinance of the House of Commons, to which the Lords gave their

my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming me with a torrent of
delight, and which brought all paradise before me, has now become an
insupportable torment, a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses

all nature budding and bursting around; the hills clothed from foot
to peak with tall, thick forest trees; the valleys in all their varied
windings, shaded with the loveliest woods; and the soft river gliding
along amongst the lisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful clouds which
the soft evening breeze wafted across the sky,--when I heard the groves
about me melodious with the music of birds, and saw the million swarms
of insects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun, whose setting
rays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds, whilst the
subdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground, and I there
observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to the dry moss,

Portuguese would be thereby prevented from meddling with their colonies
in America, and the Portuguese supposed that their East Indian
settlements, and particularly the Spice Islands, which they had then
newly found out, were for ever secured from any attempts of the Spanish
nation. But it seems the infallibility of the Holy Father had, on this
occasion, deserted him, and for want of being more conversant in
geography, he had not foreseen that the Spaniards, by pursuing their
discoveries to the west, and the Portuguese to the east, might at last
meet with each other, and be again embroiled, as it actually happened
within a few years afterwards. For Ferdinand Magellan, an officer in
the King of Portugal's service, having received some disgust from the
court, either by the defalcation of his pay, or by having his parts, as
he conceived, too cheaply considered, he entered into the service of
the King of Spain. As he appears to have been a man of ability, he was
desirous of signalizing his talents in some enterprize which might
prove extremely vexatious to his former masters, and might teach them
to estimate his worth from the greatness of the mischief he brought
upon them, this being the most obvious and natural turn of all
fugitives, more especially of those who, being really men of capacity,

law, as in the case of Zacharias, were separated from their wives at
times when they discharged their office and ministered in the temple. But since the priest of the new law ought always to be engaged in the

"Let these things, however, be said rather in sorrow
than contempt, for of contempt Bangor has already had sufficient at the
hands of generations of travellers. Many are attracted to Bangor by
reason of its cathedral, but it were better the building had not that
proud title, because those who have already made acquaintance with the
famous cathedrals of England see a lack of proportion in thus dignifying
a church that, for both size and beauty, is surpassed times without
number by parish churches in the shires. For its present want of
interest, such individually remote and entirely dissimilar persons as
Owain Glyndwr and Sir Gilbert Scott are responsible. Owain in 1402 laid
it in ruins; and Scott, who, at a cost of £35,000, was engaged from 1866
to 1875 in “restoring” the debased Perpendicular building he found here,
has impressed his own architectural nostrums upon it in a very
disastrous manner. It is a long, low structure, with a dwarf central
tower, and its own inherent disadvantages are greatly worsened by its
site being in a hollow beside the shabby street.",1900-2000,58841
"This of the European missionaries in Korea—from
the Jesuit fathers old France sent there to the Presbyterian brethren
recently sent from the United States—a surprising number of them had
the gift not of writing (for scribbling seems to come as naturally to
the average missionary as to the average nineteenth-century woman), but
of writing well, and with great discretion. If we would learn the
history of Korea, we must learn it very largely from the writings of
European missionaries, unless, indeed, we are able to read Chinese, and
have access to the fuller, more ably written, and probably more
authentic histories of Korea, written by Chinese _littérateurs_. It is a
matter of course that the Chinese, who are akin to the Koreans, and who
may almost be said to have brought them up, should make fewer blunders
in writing of Chosön than men of utterly dissimilar race and thought
habits.",1800-1900,56623
"The great century of enlightenment began with blood and the thunder of
cannon. The Spanish war of succession raged on the western frontier,

"After dinner, I
having drunk a great deal of wine, I went away, seeming to go about
business with Sir W. Pen, to my Lady Batten's (Sir William being at
Chatham), and there sat a good while, and then went away (before I went I
called at home to see whether they were gone, and found them there, and
Armiger inviting my wife to go to a play, and like a fool would be
courting her, but he is an ass, and lays out money with Tom, otherwise I
should not think him worth half this respect I shew him). To the Dolphin,
where he and I and Captain Cocke sat late and drank much, seeing the boys
in the streets flying their crackers, this day being kept all the day very
strictly in the City. At last broke up, and called at my Lady Batten's
again and would have gone to cards, but Sir W. Pen was so fuddled that we
could not try him to play, and therefore we parted, and I home and to bed. 6th. Going forth this morning I met Mr. Davenport and a friend of his,
one Mr. Furbisher, to drink their morning draft with me, and I did give it
them in good wine, and anchovies, and pickled oysters, and took them to
the Sun in Fish Street, there did give them a barrel of good ones, and a
great deal of wine, and sent for Mr. W. Bernard (Sir Robert's son), a
grocer thereabouts, and were very merry, and cost me a good deal of money,
and at noon left them, and with my head full of wine, and being invited by
a note from Luellin, that came to my hands this morning in bed, I went to
Nick Osborne's at the Victualling Office, and there saw his wife, who he
has lately married, a good sober woman, and new come to their home.",1600-1700,4130

"With a waggon of hay moving along with him, and a very little manœuvring
on his own part, the expert tactician could traverse the whole city
without the risk of a single encounter. But his having such an
accompaniment for any length of time, is of course out of the question. He
must just be content to avail himself of it when chance throws it in his
way, and be thankful for its protection throughout the length of a street.",1800-1900,53981
"When the Constable came to the Church, he alighted, and met the Pope, who
was just then going out of it in his Procession Chair. The Ambassador
kneeling before him, said to him, 'That the Emperor _Charles_ VI. King of
the _Two Sicilies_, his Master, had charg'd him to deliver to his
Holiness, the Tribute of the Hackney, and the seven thousand Ducats, which

"“You are too hasty by half. Tell me now, just what is it you want me to do in this affair?”

“Why,” said Captain Teach, “I have told you in part what I want you to
do. ’Tis first of all to write a letter to Mr. Richard Parker, saying
that you have certain information that the young lady, Colonel Parker’s
daughter, is in the hands of certain pirates, and that they won’t give
her up unless a ransom is paid for her.",1800-1900,49985
"But the
principal Engineer not arriving till the 15th, no Spot was pitched upon
for raising a Battery[_F_] against the Enemy, so that the clearing a
few Bushes away down by the Water Side, for to pitch their Tents, was
all the material Work the Army did for near a Week; and the Enemy was
contented to let them be pretty quiet, only now and then firing a Shot,
until they opened a Bomb-Battery of four Mortars and some Royals on the
17th[_G_], and then the Fascine Battery on the _Barradera_ Side annoyed
them greatly, and particularly the Camp, so that they were obliged to
remove it several Paces off. [_H_]This being represented to the Admiral, Orders were given for all
Boats of the Squadron to be ready at Midnight (manned and armed) to go
to surprize the _Barradera_ Battery, and the Command given to Captain
_Boscawen_[_I_], in which they happily succeeded, spiked up all the
Guns; burnt the Carriages, Platforms, and Guard-house; destroyed the
Magazine, and took several Prisoners[_K_]. The next Morning, as soon as
it was Day, the Enemy from _Boccachica_ began to fire warmly at the
Bomb-Battery, (as if they were angry at what happened the Night before)
though without doing them any particular Damage; and as they were
sensible of the Usefulness and advantageous Situation of this Battery,
they set busily about repairing some Part of it, and on the 20th had
built up some Embrazures and mounted two Guns, and fired them on the
Bomb-Battery again, which the Admiral observing, ordered the _Rippon_,
a sixty Gun ship, to go and anchor as near it, as possible, and keep
firing on it to prevent the Enemy's working on it any farther[_L_], so
that all the next Day the Army was in a State of Tranquillity, and on
_Sunday_ the 22d their grand Battery of twenty Guns being finished,
about eight o'Clock in the Morning began to play very briskly on the
Castle, as did the Bomb-Battery, and thirty or forty Cohorns and Royals
planted on the Platform behind the Cannon[_M_], which the Enemy
returned as briskly from the Castle, the four Ships[_N_] (Don _Blass_'s

"With him there was an
impressive individual whom I somehow recognized as a French inspector of
schools--one of those officials whose visits to provincial schools and
whose consequent reports to the minister at Paris are the chief hope and
dread of the French pedagogue. How these gentlemen should have come to
be visiting my class, I could not imagine, but I do not think I was much
worried in the dream over that question. I do remember telling myself
that as a mere American professor I had nothing to fear from the
inspector's formidable authority, though perhaps with this reflection
there went also a resolution to put my best foot forward in such
distinguished company.",1900-2000,38514
"[229]From Dr. Hugh Chamberlayn, M.D.--that King James took a moiety
of the profitts of the New River from Sir Hugh Middleton. Some say
'twas in consideration of money advanced by the king; but this is not
certain. He did indeed reconvey this back to him and his heires, etc.,
for a rent of 500 _li._ per annum, which is duly payd, but I think
graunted him from his majestie. [230]This Sir Hugh Middleton had his picture in Gold-smyths' hall with

Parliaments: And after, setling this, during the pleasure of the two
Houses_. That the world might be fully confirmed in my purposes at first, to
contribute what in Justice, Reason, Honour and Conscience I could,
to the happy success of this Parliament, (which had in Me no other
Designe, but the generall good of My Kingdoms) I willingly passed
the BILL for Trienniall Parliaments: which, as gentle and seasonable
Physick, might (if well applied) prevent any distempers from getting
any head, or prevailing; especially, if the remedy proved not a remedy
beyond all remedy. I conceived, this Parliament would finde work with convenient Recesses
for the first three years: But I did not imagine, that some men would

so much as they found well done to their hands.",1600-1700,32188

of time, policemen's lanterns lighting up the darkness, revealing
stealthy flitting forms that would escape at any price, and a mass of
men struggling under and above a pile of mattresses. My first thought (after I had seen that Don was safe) rushed to
Rameses. But the tall Chinaman with the long dark eyes was not among
the prisoners. That night (the police gleefully informed me later)
Doctor Rameses was engaged in giving a lecture at his own house, and
could not possibly have been in Chinatown.",1900-2000,38470

the human spirit?",1900-2000,32965
"His Majesty has been pleased to command, that, with a view of doing
the fullest justice to Regiments, as well as to Individuals who
have distinguished themselves by their Bravery in Action with the
Enemy, an Account of the Services of every Regiment in the British
Army shall be published under the superintendence and direction

"In the morning,
when he remembered and asked for it, she refused to return it unless
he told her two stories this way and two that way, and as he could
think of none he went off without it. When his clever brother heard
of it, he put some brass finger-rings into flour, handed it to the
same woman, and in reply to her remarks stated that there were many
rings at the bush where he picked these. When she went to pick some,
thinking them gold, the man told her husband that she had followed
a man who beckoned to her, the husband took a bamboo and gave her a
sound beating. The clever brother, learning that the baker's daughter
was betrothed to a lad at another village, told a person whom he met
to inform the boy's parents that the girl had died from snake-bite;
he himself told the girl's mother that wolves had attacked and killed
the lad.",1900-2000,57399
"These figures give us a
fair idea of the resources of this country in shipping at that time. This was the invasion which resulted in the victory of Agincourt and the
capture of Harfleur. In the year following (1416) France was again
invaded and the fleet was stated by some to have numbered 300, and by
others 400 ships. A naval battle was fought off Harfleur. It resulted in
a complete victory for Henry.",1483-1600,33098
"It cannot therefore be impertinent in any one modestly to offer his
sentiments on this topick; that by the confrontation of different
opinions we may strike out truth, as we do fire by the collision of
flints; and that, as much light as possible may be afforded to our
legislators to guide them through so dark and intricate a labyrinth. This is the more necessary, as there can be found no similar case in all
the records of history to serve as a precedent, or clew, to direct their
steps; and all they can do is to grope their way by their own industry,
and to employ their reason, as the only compass which can steer their
course aright to this land unknown. Without any farther preamble, therefore, I shall proceed to discuss this
point, and to state the case fairly between the two contending parties,
that those, who having like myself, no particular interest concerned,
have consequently little prepossession for either side, may be enabled
to form an adequate idea of the subject.",1700-1800,32463

"General _Peter Demitrewich de Yeropkin_, not more distinguished
by his birth and valour than by his polished manners and humane
disposition, was appointed by the Empress, Director-General of Health. Notwithstanding what had happened, the number of those who were
convinced that the plague had reached Moscow, was as yet inconsiderable. Dr. _Orræus_, physician to the army, who had visited impested patients
at Jassy, was now passing through Moscow in his way to Petersburgh, and
was requested to examine the sick and dead bodies before mentioned,
which he accordingly did, and declared, that the disorder was exactly
like that which, a short time before, had proved so destructive in
Moldavia and Wallachia; that it was, in fact, the plague.",1700-1800,49567

"ELEANORE CUYLER


Miss Eleanore Cuyler had dined alone with her mother that night, and
she was now sitting in the drawing-room, near the open fire, with her
gloves and fan on the divan beside her, for she was going out later to
a dance. She was reading a somewhat weighty German review, and the contrast
which the smartness of her gown presented to the seriousness of her
occupation made her smile slightly as she paused for a moment to cut
the leaves. And when the bell sounded in the hall she put the book away from her
altogether, and wondered who it might be. It might be young Wainwright, with the proof-sheets of the new story
he had promised to let her see, or flowers for the dance from
Bruce-Brice, of the English Legation at Washington, who for the time
being was practising diplomatic moves in New York, or some of her
working-girls with a new perplexity for her to unravel, or only one of
the men from the stable to tell her how her hunter was getting on
after his fall. It might be any of these and more.",1800-1900,11019
"The Expedition was thoroughly organized before the men
started north, and supplies were left at convenient points, so that
starvation would not kill off the adventurers as it had done to so many
other explorers. Establishing headquarters at McCormick Bay, on the western coast
of Greenland, Peary and his men made sledge excursions along Whale
Sound, Inglefield Gulf, and Humboldt Glacier, proving that the coasts
of Greenland converged at the northern portion, doubtless forming an
island of what was thought to be a peninsula. Although his leg was
broken when crossing Melville Bay, the brave explorer persisted in
his work, and returned in September, 1892, with a brilliant record of
results accomplished. With one companion, Astrup, he had ascended to the summit of the great
ice cap which covers the interior of Greenland, 5,000 to 8,000 feet
in elevation, and had pushed northward for 500 miles over a region
where no white man had ever been before.",1900-2000,50415

"The other is chiefly inhabited with lawyers and brave
gentlemen, being the chief or highest appeal of their suits in law of
all the islands about it and of the mainland coast next unto it. And
it is of no such account as Carthagena, for these and some like reasons
which I could give you, over long to be now written. The warning which this town received of our coming towards them from St.
Domingo, by the space of 20 days before our arrival here, was cause that
they had both fortified and every way prepared for their best defence. As also that they had carried and conveyed away all their treasure and
principal substance.",1483-1600,3334
"It was often so with Mrs. Shelley, in some degree before her
husband's death, and in a greater degree after that event. An imaginative
and highly emotional woman, she sometimes saw things in a wrong light. Not
seldom, her mental vision was affected by the delusive media of
sentimentality or anger, through which it regarded matters that stirred
her feelings. In speaking of herself she was sometimes strongly influenced
by romantic egotism. Affection and combativeness combined to render her an
unreliable witness about matters touching her husband's honour.",1800-1900,41748

arms, locked in a close embrace: I pressed her to my bosom, and covered
with countless kisses those dear lips which murmured in reply soft
protestations of love. My sight became confused by the delicious
intoxication of her eyes. Heavens! is it sinful to revel again in such
happiness, to recall once more those rapturous moments with intense
delight? Charlotte!",1700-1800,2527
"Then Seha lay down to sleep; for were not the thunder spirits awake? When the night was late, Seha was awakened by the howl of the thunder. He saw the quick lightning pierce the boiling darkness in the east. Then the rain drops danced upon the dry hills with a sound like the
unintelligible patter of many voices that are glad.",1900-2000,50464
"The carpet was marked all over, especially on the side of the
door, with traces of dirty boots, which were presumably left by the
murderer. It was evident that some one had entered by the surgery door,
had killed the doctor, and had then made his escape unseen. That the
assailant was a man was certain, from the size of the footprints and
from the nature of the injuries. But beyond that point the police found
it very difficult to go.",1900-2000,54109
"This shallow character of foundations on sandy beds,
to which I have already alluded in a former lecture, is certainly a
peculiarity of Southern Indian engineering; but you will see the long
<DW72> or apron of stone in rear of the weir, where the action of the
water is most severely felt after being checked in its onward flow,
and caused to whirl and scour. Very severe action takes place here for
some time after the weir is built, and large quantities of loose rough
stone are thrown in from time to time to fill up all gaps in the <DW72>,
until the whole work has become firm. Moreover, the sand in these
rivers is of a coarser texture than that in Upper India, which, when
saturated with water, becomes a mere quicksand, which would swallow up
a much greater quantity of stone than the other.",1800-1900,56245

much excellency of mind and behaviour, as would strike every body in her
favour at first sight, I should not have dared to class her with such of
my worthy neighbours, as now so kindly congratulate us both. I own, said she, softly, I was one of your censurers; but I never liked
you so well in my life, as for this action, now I see how capable your
bride is of giving distinction to any condition.--And, coming to me, My
dear neighbour, said she, excuse me for having but in my thought, the
remembrance that I have seen you formerly, when, by your sweet air and

orders to move. Marching out on the Georgetown pike, passing a place
called Hamilton, and then marching ten miles, through Snickersville,
near Snicker's Gap, the Potomac army encamped on the same ground the
previous year when in pursuit of Lee--reaching the banks of the
Shenandoah river during the afternoon; the enemy had halted, and were in
force on the opposite side, with a determination to resist our advance
and to give battle if our troops attempted a crossing; everything was in
their favor, as our men had the river to cross under fire. There was no
other alternative but to wade it nearly waist deep, and with a raking
fire from concealed batteries posted on a hill. The column halted, and a
skirmish line was formed, the men cooking dinner. Nearly every man had

superiority over the government actually created; and though its
inconsistency with American tendencies was yearly more apparent, he never

quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it was grief at finding himself
vanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberation and
disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state,
strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelor
bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which
he himself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the
shine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his own
money two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the
other Butron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him. But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friends

the introduction to his _Animals and Plants under Domestication_ (p. 6)

  mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural
  laws,—and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.”

But while he thus clearly saw, and distinctly asserted, that the factors
of organic evolution are the concrete actions, inner and outer, to which
every organism is subject, Mr. Darwin, by habitually using the
convenient figure of speech, was, I think, prevented from recognizing so
fully as he would otherwise have done, certain fundamental consequences
of these actions. Though it does not personalize the cause, and does not assimilate its
mode of working to a human mode of working, kindred objections may be
urged against the expression to which I was led when seeking to present
the phenomena in literal terms rather than metaphorical terms—the

difficulty of following such a record that we have only facts to
follow. We know little or nothing of motives except from results, and
as in the development of knowledge the measure of success can only
bear a small ratio to that of endeavour, it is manifest that we should
show a large and tolerant understanding of the motives which animate
the seeker for truth. In the course of his long life John Dee visited
many lands, sojourned in many centres of learning, had relations of
common interests as well as of friendship with many great scholars,
and made as thinker, mathematician, and astronomer, a reputation far
transcending any ephemeral and purely gaseous publicity arising from

their Voyage to the _East-Indies_, whither they were bound, but it was
their hard Fate, by a Breach of the Sea near Cape _Buona Esperanca_, to
be swallowed of the merciless Waves, whole Rage they awhile before had
so hardly escaped; the rest as I likewise heard, who were about twenty
six Persons they took into their Ship, and set them on Land at _Cape
Verde_. As for myself, being now ashore in an Island inhabited by _Spaniards_,
I reckoned I was safe, but found myself mistaken, for it was my hap to
pitch upon that Part of the Isle where the _Pike_ begins to rise, which
is inhabited by a Savage People who live upon the Sides of that Hill,
the Top whereof is for the most Part covered with Snow, and formerly
accounted, for its Steepness, inaccessible, either for Man or Beast,
yet these Savages fearing the _Spaniards_ keep as near the Top as they
can, never coming down into the fruitful Vallies but to seek for Booty;
a Crew of these Outlaws happened to spy me soon after I landed, and
thinking they had got a Prize, approached me with all Speed; I guess
their Design before they came within half a Mile, when perceiving them
come down the Hill directly toward me, with long Staves and other
Weapons, I thought it necessary to secure myself from these Villains,
who out of Hatred to us _Spaniards_ would have cut me to Pieces; the
Country was sandy, but the _Pike_ beginning to lift up itself, I espied
in the Side a white Cliff, which I Hoped my _Ganzas_ Would take for
a Mark, and being put up, would make all that way, whereby I might
be carried so far, that those barbarous Rascals should not overtake
me, before I got to some _Spaniard_'s House, or hid myself, till by
the Covert of the Night I might travel to _Laguna_, the chief City of
the Island, three Miles off. So I settled myself upon my Engine, and
let loose the Reins to my _Gansas_, who by good Fortune took all one
Course, tho' not just the Way I aimed at. But what of that! O Reader
prick up thy Ears, and prepare thyself to hear the strangest Chance
that ever happened to any Mortal, and which I know thou wilt not have
the Grace to believe till thou seest the like Experiment, which I doubt
not in a short Time may be performed.",1700-1800,46591
"and I
hold this confirmed by having noticed that when I was by the wall of the
yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to
mount upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because they no
doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am
that if I had been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged
thee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered
their freak for ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened
the laws of chivalry, which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a
knight to lay hands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and
great necessity in defence of his own life and person."" ""I would have avenged myself too if I could,"" said Sancho, ""whether I had
been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am
persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or
enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like
ourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them when
they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and another
Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque
the Left-handed; so that, senor, your not being able to leap over the
wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else
besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that
these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such
misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that
the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to
return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and
give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the
saying is."" ""How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,"" replied Don Quixote;
""hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see
with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the
pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be
in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, and
triumphing over one's enemy? None, beyond all doubt."" ""Very likely,"" answered Sancho, ""though I do not know it; all I know is
that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been
one (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number)
we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even
out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the
less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more
cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and
above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge
myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it, of
conquering an enemy is like.""",1600-1700,5909

"I therefore turned away, and hurried by Dido

"It may also be pointed out that the obesity so
common after castration is not a feature of “the lean and slippered
pantaloon.” Further, after the menopause the ovaries undergo fibrotic
atrophy, and it appears from Professor Turnbull’s observations (_vide_
p. 114) that the interstitial cells are very scanty or absent; further
observations are necessary as to the presence of interstitial cells in
senescent ovaries, but presuming that they are scanty it would follow,
on the hypothesis that the interstitial cells exert an influence
in preventing the onset of old age, that women should become old
much sooner than men in whom the interstitial cells are apparently
much more in evidence. It cannot of course be admitted that such a
difference in the sex incidence of old age exists. The improved health
and rejuvenation after _x_-ray treatment for metrorrhagia and uterine
fibromyomas at the climacteric or post-climacteric age have been
regarded by Steinach and Bordier as due to hypertrophy of the ovarian
interstitial cells following induced atrophy of the ova, but to accept
this there must be definite evidence that the interstitial cells are
increased in number.",1700-1800,57215

"It is
needless to rehearse what is known to all. Aforetime they came together
to learn; now they feign that it is a kind of life instituted to
merit grace and righteousness; yea, they preach that it is a state of
perfection, and they put it far above all other kinds of life ordained
of God. These things we have rehearsed without odious exaggeration, to
the end that the doctrine of our teachers on this point might be better
understood. First, concerning such as contract matrimony, they teach on our part
that it is lawful for all men who are not fitted for single life
to contract matrimony, because vows cannot annul the ordinance and
commandment of God.",1483-1600,275
"As for _Tew_ himself, he with a few others in a short Time went off to
_Rhode Island_, from whence he made his Peace. Thus have we accounted for the Company our Pyrates met with here. It must be observed that the Natives of _Madagascar_ are a kind of <DW64>s,
they differ from those of _Guiney_ in their Hair, which is long, and their
Complexion is not so good a Jet; they have innumerable little Princes among
them, who are continually making War upon one another; their Prisoners are
their Slaves, and they either sell them, or put them to death, as they
please: When our Pyrates first settled amongst them, their Alliance was
much courted by these Princes, so they sometimes joined one, sometimes
another, but wheresoever they sided, they were sure to be Victorious; for
the <DW64>s here had no Fire-Arms, nor did they understand their Use; so
that at length these Pyrates became so terrible to the <DW64>s, that if two
or or three of them were only seen on one Side, when they were going to
engage, the opposite Side would fly without striking a Blow. By these Means they not only became feared, but powerful; all the Prisoners
of War, they took to be their Slaves; they married the most beautiful of
the Negroe Women; not one or two, but as many as they liked; so that every
one of them had as great a Seraglio as the Grand Seignior at
_Constantinople_: Their Slaves they employed in planting Rice, in Fishing,
Hunting, _&c._ besides which, they had abundance of others, who lived, as
it were, under their Protection, and to be secure from the Disturbances or
Attacks of their powerful Neighbours; these seemed to pay them a willing
Homage. Now they began to divide from one another, each living with his own
Wives, Slaves and Dependants, like a separate Prince; and as Power and
Plenty naturally beget Contention, they sometimes quarrelled with one
another, and attacked each other at the Head of their several Armies; and
in these civil Wars, many of them were killed; but an Accident happened,
which obliged them to unite again for their common Safety.",1700-1800,40580

confidently I threw at all, which I nicked with eleven, and so continued

failure. The Dayton _Transcript_ when he began with it was a tri-weekly,
but he made it a daily, and this mistake infected the whole enterprise. It made harder work for us all than we had known before; and the
printing-office, which had been my delight, became my oppression after
the brief moment of public schooling which I somehow knew.",1900-2000,47060
"Their movements and cries are the
signs which he interprets as omens, confirming or weakening the import
of those given by the hawks. Of these other omens the most regarded are
those given by the three species of the spider-hunter (ARACHNOTHERA
CHRYSOGENYS, A. MODESTA, and A. LONGIROSTRIS). All three species are
known as ""Sit"" or ""Isit."" When travelling on the river, the Kenyahs
hope to see ""Isit"" fly across from left to right as they sit facing the
bow of the canoe. When this happens they call out loudly, saying, ""O,
Isit on the left hand!",1900-2000,3307

"But naturally one who is conscious that he has
persevered through a long portion of his life up to the end in the
progress to the better, and this genuine moral motives, may well
have the comforting hope, though not the certainty, that even in an
existence prolonged beyond this life he will continue in these
principles; and although he is never justified here in his own eyes,
nor can ever hope to be so in the increased perfection of his
nature, to which he looks forward, together with an increase of
duties, nevertheless in this progress which, though it is directed
to a goal infinitely remote, yet is in God's sight regarded as
equivalent to possession, he may have a prospect of a blessed
future; for this is the word that reason employs to designate
perfect well-being independent of all contingent causes of the
world, and which, like holiness, is an idea that can be contained only
in an endless progress and its totality, and consequently is never
fully attained by a creature. {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 40}

V. The Existence of God as a Postulate of Pure Practical Reason. In the foregoing analysis the moral law led to a practical problem
which is prescribed by pure reason alone, without the aid of any
sensible motives, namely, that of the necessary completeness of the
first and principle element of the summum bonum, viz., morality;
and, as this can be perfectly solved only in eternity, to the
postulate of immortality. The same law must also lead us to affirm the
possibility of the second element of the summum bonum, viz., happiness
proportioned to that morality, and this on grounds as disinterested as
before, and solely from impartial reason; that is, it must lead to the
supposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect; in
other words, it must postulate the existence of God, as the
necessary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum (an
object of the will which is necessarily connected with the moral
legislation of pure reason).",1700-1800,5683
"""This is to be the correct thing,"" cried Cleremont ""We open with a
quadrille; take your partners, gentlemen, and to your places."" Nothing could be more perfectly proper and decorous than this dance. It is possible, perhaps, that we exceeded a little on the score of
reverential observances: we bowed and courtesied at every imaginable
opportunity, and with an air of homage that smacked of a court; and if
we did raise our eyes to each other, as we recovered from the obeisance,
it was with a look of the softest and most subdued deference. I really
began to think that the only hoydenish people I had ever seen
were ladies and gentlemen. As for Eccles, he wore an air of almost
reverential gravity, and Hotham was sternly composed.",1900-2000,32693
"Having given an Account of the Enemy's Situation and Strength, it may
likewise be necessary to relate some Account of the State of the Army,
and what pretty Instruments and Materials they were furnished withal. That the whole Body of the Troops, that came from _England_ (unless two
Regiments) were raw, new raised, undisciplined Men, is a Fact known to
every one; and the greatest Part of the Officers commanding them,
either young Gentlemen whose Quality or Interest entitled them to
Preferment, or abandoned Wretches of the Town, whose Prostitution had
made them useful on some dirty Occasion, and by Way of Reward were
provided for in the Army; but both these Sorts of Gentlemen had never
seen any Services, consequently, knew not properly how to act, or
command; so that the worthy old experienced Officers, who had served
long and well, underwent a continual Hardship, in teaching and
disciplining a young raw Army, at a Time when they were on Service, and
every one ought to have been Masters of their Trade, instead of having
it to learn; and thus, by more frequently exposing themselves, most of
them were knocked on the Head. As for the _American_ Troops, they were
in general many Degrees worse, but the Officers in particular, who were
composed of Blacksmiths, Taylors, Shoemakers, and all the Banditti that
Country affords, insomuch, that the other Parts of the Army held them
in scorn. And for Engineers, Bombardiers, and Gunners, worse never bore
the Name, or could be picked out of all _Europe_.",1700-1800,27173
"Thus in 1422 we
find John van Eyck attached to the Count's household as painter and
""varlet de chambre,"" and, as we gather from the prince's household
accounts, engaged in the decoration of the palace at The Hague from the
24th of October in that year till the 11th of September 1424. Another
member of the household at the time was his kinsman, Henry van Eyck, the
record of whose faithful services won him in February 1425 the post of
master of the hunt to Jacqueline's second husband, John IV., Duke of
Brabant. John of Bavaria died on the 25th of January 1425, and, as might
have been expected, civil war immediately broke out. The situation
proving uncongenial, the whilom court painter lost no time in taking the
road to Flanders, where Philip III., Duke of Burgundy, was lording it
as the most munificent patron of the arts and sciences and of letters. With a keen eye for available talent, this princely despot at once
enlisted him in his service.",1700-1800,41798

"But Martinez,
not desirous to stay, obtained the favour of Inga to depart; with whom
he sent divers Guianians to conduct him to the river of Orenoque, all
loaden with as much gold as they could carry, which he gave to Martinez
at his departure. But when he was arrived near the river's side, the
borderers which are called Orenoqueponi (poni is a Carib postposition
meaning ""on"") robbed him and his Guianians of all the treasure (the
borderers being at that time at wars, which Inga had not conquered) save
only of two great bottles of gourds, which were filled with beads of
gold curiously wrought, which those Orenoqueponi thought had been
no other thing than his drink or meat, or grain for food, with which
Martinez had liberty to pass. And so in canoas he fell down from the
river of Orenoque to Trinidad, and from thence to Margarita, and so to
St. Juan del Puerto Rico; where, remaining a long time for passage into
Spain, he died.",1483-1600,2272

"From his position on the pike at the gap in the breastworks
Wagner could see for himself Stewart's corps forming in Conrad's front, as
already described, but his view of Lane's front was obstructed by the
large number of trees and by the inequalities of the ground on the west
side of the pike. Colonel Lane told Whitesides that Hood was forming his
army in battle order and that without any doubt it was his intention to
attack in force; that the position occupied by the two brigades was
faulty, being without any support on either flank, and unless they were
withdrawn they would be run over by the enemy or compelled to fall back to
the breastworks under fire. On reporting Lane's statement to Wagner,
Whitesides was directed to find General Stanley, the corps commander, and
tell him what Lane had said. He found Stanley with Schofield at the house
of Doctor Cliffe in the central part of the town, where they could see
nothing of what was going on in front, and reported to them as stated
above. He then returned to Wagner who, so far as he knew, received no
further orders.",1900-2000,31468

be described as a sense of subjection to imperious impulses which urge
our finite nature toward infinite issues; a sense of propulsions which

ourselves, with which, nevertheless, in essence we are one; a sense, in
times of moral stress, of channels opened by persistent effort, which
let in a flood of rejuvenating energy and put us in command of
unsuspected moral resources; a sense, finally, of the complicity of our
life with the life of others, of living in them in no merely
metaphorical signification of the word; of unity with all spiritual
being whatsoever. A religion which is to satisfy us must be a religion of progress. But we

that the custom of each province be observed if it employs nothing

miraculous Recovery, but has at all Times assisted you in Writing
the Names of Strangers, discovering the most secret Intrigues and
foretelling future Events, for which you have long been Famous. As a
further Proof of the Existence of Spirits and that at some other Times,
as well as in your Case, they have prescrib'd Physick to their living
Friends, I shall quote an Instance out of Mr. _Glanvil_'s _Reports_,
attested by the late Lord _Orrery_, the Famous Mr. _Greatrix_, and many
others, living in the Reign of King _Charles_ the Second. A Gentleman in _Ireland_, near to the Earl of _Orrery_'s House, sending
his Butler one Afternoon to a neighbouring Village to buy Cards, as he
pass'd a Field, espy'd a Company in the middle thereof, sitting round
a Table, with several Dishes of good Cheer before them, and moving
towards 'em, they all arose and Saluted him, desiring him to sit down
and take part with them; but one of them whisper'd these Words in his
Ear, _viz._ _Do nothing this Company invites you to_: Whereupon, he
refusing to accept of their Kindness, the Table and all the Dainties
it was furnish'd with immediately vanish'd, but the Company fell to
Dancing and playing upon divers Musical Instruments, the Butler being
a second Time solicited to partake of their Diversions, but would not
be prevail'd upon to engage himself with them; upon which, they left
off their Merry-making and all fell to Work, still pressing the Butler
to make one among 'em, but to no purpose; so that, upon his third
refusal, they all vanish'd and left the Butler alone, who in a great
Consternation return'd home, without the Cards, fell into a Fit as he
enter'd the House, but, soon recovering his Senses, related to his
Master all that had pass'd. THE following Night, one of the Ghostly Company came to the Butler's
Bed-side and told him, that if he offer'd to stir out the next Day, he
would be carry'd away; upon whose Advice, he kept within till towards
the Evening, and having then an Occasion to make Water, ventur'd to
set one Foot over the Threshold of the Door, in order to ease himself,
which he had no sooner done, but a Rope was cast about his Middle, in
the Sight of several Standers-by, and the poor Man was hurry'd from
the Porch with unaccountable Swiftness, follow'd by many Persons, but
they were not nimble enough to overtake him, till a Horseman, well
mounted, happening to meet him upon the Road, and seeing many followers
in pursuit of a Man hurry'd along in a Rope, without any Body to
force him, catch'd hold of the Cord and stop'd him in his Career, but
receiv'd, for his Pains, such a strap upon his Back with one End of
the Rope, as almost fell'd him from his Horse; however, being a good
Christian, he was too strong for the Devil, and recover'd the Butler
out of the Spirits Clutches and brought him back to his Friends.",1700-1800,54925

the town in a ferment, even playing the country-folk home to the farms,
followed by bands of towns-folk. They were a quarrelsome set, the
ploughmen and others; and it was generally admitted in the town that
their overbearing behavior was responsible for the fights. I mind them

"The late Queen
having always look'd upon her younger Son as the Hopes and Support of
her Family, she had taken care to put about him none but those, whose
Wisdom, Learning, and Integrity might entitle them to a share of the
Prince's Love; such were his Governours, and of such chiefly was his
Houshold compos'd. These had taken care to let the Prince know, that he
need not despair of one day wearing the Crown of _Portugal_, for that
there was no great likelihood of his Brother's ever having any Children;
but at the same time they told him, that there was nothing but _Melhor_
was capable of doing, to keep him from inheriting the Crown, since he
was well assur'd that he must never hope for any share in the Ministry,
when Don _Pedro_ should ascend the Throne. By degrees these different Views and Interests divided the Court into

"He tells me that he thanks God he never knew what it was to be
tempted to be a knave in his life; till he did come into the House of
Commons, where there is nothing done but by passion, and faction, and
private interest. Reames did tell me of a fellow last night (one Kelsy, a
commander of a fire-ship, who complained for want of his money paid him)
did say that he did see one of the Commissioners of the Navy bring in
three waggon-loads of prize-goods into Greenwich one night; but that the
House did take no notice of it, nor enquire; but this is me, and I must
expect to be called to account, and answer what I did as well as I can. So thence away home, and in Holborne, going round, it being dark, I espied
Sir D. Gawden's coach, and so went out of mine into his; and there had
opportunity to talk of the business of victuals, which the Duke of
Albemarle and Prince did complain that they were in want of the last year:
but we do conclude we shall be able to show quite the contrary of that;
only it troubles me that we must come to contend with these great persons,
which will overrun us. So with some disquiet in my mind on this account I

so act as to establish peace, which he could easily have established by
one little word, since I at that time promised to be silent and to make
an end of my case, if he would command my adversaries to do the same. But that man of pride, not content with this agreement, began to justify
my adversaries, to give them free licence, and to order me to recant, a

"An art which furnishes such an extensive field for amusement, reduced
to plain and simple rules, digested in a familiar manner, (which the
most limited capacities will be able to understand,) cannot fail to
be entertaining to every admirer of scientific amusement. It has been regretted by many that no publication of a like nature
is now extant; and a celebrated writer, long known to the popular
reader, has even said, that “the English have no respectable work on
the subject.”

How far the present will supply such a desideratum must be left
for the candid reader to determine. The Author would wish it to
be understood, that although he has conducted some part of his
Work upon mathematical principles, it is not intended as a perfect
philosophical work on the subject, but as an attempt to embody into
one small volume, all that has hitherto been written on the subject;
and if from which, the Pyrotechnic Tyro receive any assistance for
the attainment of an Art, which has for its object such an endless
source of entertainment, the Author’s purpose will be positively
realized. Though very much protracted, we cannot close our Introduction without
observing, that few spectacles are more beautiful or more calculated
for entertainment, than a well-conducted display of fire-works, in
which are exhibited such various bodies, so brilliantly illuminated,
and arranged in the most variegated forms: sometimes producing
surprising and unexpected manations, moving with velocity through the
air, throwing out innumerable sparks or blazing balls, which fly off
into the infinity of space: others suddenly exploding, scatter abroad
luminous fragments of fire, which are trajected with the most speedy
trepidation: and again, others are revolving on a quiescent centre,
and by their revolutions produce the most beautiful circles of fire,
which seem to vie with each other in their emanations of splendour
and light.",1700-1800,58756

THE DEATH OF THOMAS CHATTERTON


  A gutted wick, still flutteringly aflame
  Upon a roughened bench--bare walls, bare floor,
  And glimmering gray of sunrise--yes, and more--
  Ah, brother, for I call thee by that name--
  Mine eyes tear-blinded to thy figure came,
  Thy figure fallen like a flower when hoar
  Frosts blight. Thy soul wont like the lark to soar
  The light-flushed dawn, now takes a loftier aim. Thy funeral chant, the slow-entoning wind;
  Thy churched tomb, the pillared vault of morn;
  Thy requiem, the birds: Thus art thou dead,
  Pale, spectred want, thy tribute from thy kind;
  But God, himself, thy dirges shall adorn
  With sighing psalms of every wind that's sped. _May 8, 1912._

effects of forming a dominion on this plan, and to see whether it so
effectually kept within bounds both rulers and ruled, that the former were
never tyrannical and the latter never rebellious. (17:110) Those who administer or possess governing power, always try to
surround their high-handed actions with a cloak of legality, and to persuade
the people that they act from good motives; this they are easily able to
effect when they are the sole interpreters of the law; for it is evident
that they are thus able to assume a far greater freedom to carry out their
wishes and desires than if the interpretation if the law is vested in
someone else, or if the laws were so self-evident that no one could be in
doubt as to their meaning. [17:8] (111) We thus see that the power of
evil-doing was greatly curtailed for the Hebrew captains by the fact that the

and weak, when they are hindred, either by some Interior Irregularity,
or through some Exterior Occasion, from their sleeping actions. The
Opinion of the Major Part, was, That sleeping actions are actions
of rote, and not such altering actions as digesting actions, and
nourishing actions, which are uniting actions. Besides, that the reason
why the Interior actions are not sleeping actions, was, That when the
Exterior Parts move in the actions of Sleep, the Interior Parts move
when the Exterior are awake; as may be observed by the Human Pulse, and
Human Respiration; and by many other Observations which may be brought. CHAP.",1600-1700,58404

"From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and
began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don
Quixote's fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush
at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his
comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had
for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty
cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion
that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don
Quixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the
clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad
plight. Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing
him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was
poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his
life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's shouting, but seeing
that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had
killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to
his heels across the country like a deer. By this time all Don Quixote's companions had come up to where he lay;
but the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the
officers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,
and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their
scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,
resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against
their assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter
better than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his
master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable
lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead.",1600-1700,5920
"It is by these methods and by the vibration of the reins, that I unite
the feeling in my hand with that in the horse's mouth, and thus I play
with a fine and MADE mouth, and freshen and relieve the two bars in
which the feeling resides. Therefore, it is that correspondence and sensation between the horse's
mouth and the hand of the rider, which alone can make him submit with
pleasure to the constraint of the bit. Having thus explained the different positions and motions of the hand,
permit me in a few words to shew the effects which they produce in
horsemanship? The hand directs the reins, the reins operate upon the branches of the
bit; the branches upon the mouth-piece and the curb, the mouth-piece
operates upon the bars, and the curb upon the chin of the horse. So far for the management of the bridle hand upon thorough-broke and
well-dressed horses.",1700-1800,31957

upheld the land as the deepest foundation of England’s greatness of

speeches, and regarding subjects the most various, in which he presses
home the substantial importance of a territorial constitution, and the
fact that the landed interest is in truth not only a safeguard for
freedom in peace and vigour in war, but also an industrial interest of
the highest order; and doubly so, because by sentiment, by tradition,
by its contribution to local government, to stability, to the social
scale of duties conditioning the tenure of property, to physique, its
influence is essential and exceptional.",1900-2000,53917
"The direction of the fleet being now put in commission, Sir George Rooke
was entrusted with the command of the squadron appointed to escort the
Smyrna fleet, and the joint admirals received orders to accompany him as
far to sea as they thought proper; after which his instructions were to
take the best care of the fleet he could, and, in case of any
misfortune, to retire into some of the Spanish ports and put himself
under the protection of their guns. The combined fleet had not proceeded far before the accompanying
admirals signified their intention to return, and Sir George Rooke, who
had good reason to believe that the French squadron had gone to Toulon
with a view to intercepting the ships under his convoy, had to content
himself with protesting against the withdrawal of the grand fleet so
early in the voyage, and proceeding upon the journey alone. On June the
15th, being about sixty leagues short of Cape St. Vincent, he ordered
the _Lark_ to stretch ahead of his scouts into Lagos Bay; and on the
following day, having confirmed advice of danger, from the close
proximity of the enemy, proposed in a council of war to keep the wind or

"This Rev. Father, realizing the enormity of the
Katipunan plot, advised them to send Patino to him without delay. Patino presented himself at the convento and underwent a close
examination at the hands of Padre Mariano. At first little progress
was made, as Patino feared both the anger of the authorities and
that of his fellow katipuneros, who would doubtless take revenge upon
him according to the laws of the society, for his tale-telling. And
in spite of the fact that he tried at every turn to avoid telling

should govern. For while the people of that country are little better
than the cattle of the nobility, you must not wonder if, according as
these can make their markets with foreign princes, you find those to be
driven upon your grounds. And if you be so tender, now you have it
in your power, as not to hold a hand upon them that may prevent the
slaughter which must otherwise ensue in like cases, the blood will lie
at your door.",1600-1700,2801

board, I went on shore, sent for Paowang, made him a present of a dog and a

see how well pleased every one present was, with the means I took to obtain
it. With one voice they gave their consent, Paowang joining his also, which
he perhaps could not have done without the others; for I do not know that
he had either more property, or more authority, than the rest. This point
being obtained, I took our friend on board to dinner, and after it was
over, went with him ashore, to pay a visit to an old chief, who was said to
be king of the island; which was a doubt with me.",1700-1800,15869

by _Eumenius_ the Rhetorician, we find this Passage, ""_Aut haec ipsa_,

the _Franks_, more than if the Waters of their Rivers, _or their Sea_,
had cover'd it;"" but now ceases to be barbarous, and is civilized. To
the same Purpose is _Procopius_ Testimony, in his first Book of the
_Gothick War_; for where he describes the place where the _Rhine_ falls
into the Ocean; ""In these Parts (says he) there are great Marshes, where
of old the _Germans_ dwelt; a barbarous People, and at that time of
small Reputation, which now are called _Franks_--."" And _Zonaras_, in
the 3d Tome of his _Annals_, quotes this very Passage of _Procopius_. Also _Flavius Vopiscus_, in his Life of _Probus_, tells us, That the
_Franks_ were discomfited by _Probus_ in their inaccessible

was 600 miles farther off than they supposed, and many impediments to
them unknown and unheard. After I had displanted Don Antonio de Berreo,
who was upon the same enterprise, leaving my ships at Trinidad, at the
port called Curiapan, I wandered 400 miles into the said country by land

of the Indies, or Peru. All the most of the kings of the borders are
already become her Majesty's vassals, and seem to desire nothing more

eighth of the celestial spheres at one common distance from the central
earth) were in reality set in the heavens at various distances from the

with our fate, we are reconciled to our existence, for the knowledge is
again put far from us that suffering is essential to this existence
itself, and true satisfaction impossible. The result of this form of
development is a somewhat melancholy disposition, the constant endurance
of a single great pain, and the contempt for all lesser sorrows or joys
that proceeds from it; consequently an already nobler phenomenon than that
constant seizing upon ever-new forms of illusion, which is much more
common.",1900-2000,38427
"The queene, being in this wise persuaded, such word sent vnto hir
sonne, and vnto hir brother being about the king, and ouer that the
duke of Glocester himselfe and other lords the chiefe of his bend,
wrote vnto the king so reuerentlie, and to the queenes freends there
so louinglie, that they nothing earthlie mistrusting, brought the
king vp in great hast, not in good speed, with a sober companie. Now
was the king in his waie to London gone from Northampton, when these
dukes of Glocester and Buckingham came thither, where remained behind
the lord Riuers the kings vncle, intending on the morrow to follow
the king, and to be with him at Stonie Stratford [certeine] miles
thence earlie yer he departed. So was there made that night much
freendlie cheere betweene these dukes & the lord Riuers a great while,
but inc[=o]tinent, after that they were openlie with great courtesie

"so tender and delicate that the smallest cross is now complained of as an
insufferable burden, and a little trouble and toil undergone for the sake
of God and our neighbor, seems a sufficient plea why men should start back
into the smooth way, and forsake the Lord; whereas he sends such trials
upon men for the purpose of promoting thereby the recovery of their own
souls, and the glory of his name. 8. Thus the Lord laid aside for a while the form of God. But this was not
all. He did no less lay aside the use of the divine wisdom which resided
in him.",1700-1800,34736
"By the
12th of June they got sight of the Lizard, and the 15th, in the
evening, to their infinite joy, they came safe to an anchor at
Spithead. But that the signal perils which had so often threatned them
in the preceding part of the enterprize might pursue them to the very
last, Mr. Anson learnt on his arrival that there was a French fleet of
considerable force cruising in the chops of the Channel, which, from
the account of their position, he found the _Centurion_ had ran
through, and had been all the time concealed by a fog. Thus was this
expedition finished, when it had lasted three years and nine months,
after having, by its event, strongly evinced this important truth, that
though prudence, intrepidity, and perseverance united are not exempted
from the blows of adverse fortune, yet in a long series of transactions
they usually rise superior to its power, and in the end rarely fail of
proving successful. {381}

confederate chattering with cold and bewailing the loss of their
illgotten gains. But the peculiar charm of the play, as compared with
any of those which have been already noticed, is the sentiment of
natural piety--not unlike that expressed in the 'rustica Phidyle,' of
Horace[68]--by which the drama is pervaded. This key-note is struck in
the prologue uttered by Arcturus, whose function it is to shine in the

"CHAPTER XI - AN INQUIRY WHETHER THE APOSTLES WROTE THEIR
EPISTLES AS APOSTLES AND PROPHETS, OR MERELY AS TEACHERS;
AND AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY AN APOSTLE. (1) No reader of the New Testament can doubt that the Apostles were
prophets; but as a prophet does not always speak by revelation, but only, at
rare intervals, as we showed at the end of Chap. I., we may fairly inquire
whether the Apostles wrote their Epistles as prophets, by revelation and
express mandate, as Moses, Jeremiah, and others did, or whether only as
private individuals or teachers, especially as Paul, in Corinthians xiv:6,
mentions two sorts of preaching. (2) If we examine the style of the Epistles, we shall find it totally
different from that employed by the prophets. (3) The prophets are continually asserting that they speak by the command of
God: ""Thus saith the Lord,"" ""The Lord of hosts saith,"" ""The command of the
Lord,"" &c.; and this was their habit not only in assemblies of the prophets,
but also in their epistles containing revelations, as appears from the epistle
of Elijah to Jehoram, 2 Chron.",1600-1700,991

conception, may enter afresh upon its struggles for worthiness in other

is unalloyed by any selfish motive, is founded upon a really exalted
sentiment, and it is Love and Virtue themselves that here take up the

After Mr. Robert Cunningham had received a good education, he became
chaplain to the duke of Buccleugh's regiment in Holland, and was
afterward settled minister at Holywood in Ireland, sometime before Mr.
Blair was settled at Bangor, and with whom Mr. Blair, after his
settlement in that place, contracted such an acquaintance as was
comfortable to them both. He applied himself close unto the work of the ministry, which no doubt
to him was the most desireable of all employments, being in the pulpit
in his own element, like a fish in the water, or bird in the air, always
judging that therein a Christian might enjoy much fellowship with Christ
and have an opportunity of doing him the best of services, considering
what Christ said to Peter, John xxi. 15.",1700-1800,28272
"They also have gotten a nephew of Morequito, whom they have christened
and named Don Juan, of whom they have great hope, endeavouring by all
means to establish him in the said province. Among many other trades,
those Spaniards used canoas to pass to the rivers of Barema, Pawroma,
and Dissequebe (Essequibo), which are on the south side of the mouth of
Orenoque, and there buy women and children from the cannibals, which are
of that barbarous nature, as they will for three or four hatchets
sell the sons and daughters of their own brethren and sisters, and for
somewhat more even their own daughters. Hereof the Spaniards make great
profit; for buying a maid of twelve or thirteen years for three or four
hatchets, they sell them again at Margarita in the West Indies for fifty
and an hundred pesos, which is so many crowns. The master of my ship, John Douglas, took one of the canoas which came
laden from thence with people to be sold, and the most of them escaped;
yet of those he brought, there was one as well favoured and as well
shaped as ever I saw any in England; and afterwards I saw many of them,
which but for their tawny colour may be compared to any in Europe. They
also trade in those rivers for bread of cassavi, of which they buy
an hundred pound weight for a knife, and sell it at Margarita for ten
pesos.",1483-1600,2272
"Imagine the misery this cactus gave the
scantily-clad Salados as they moved about gathering wild food and
hunting deer and other creatures. The teddybear’s joints break off very
easily and stick to a victim at the slightest contact, even seeming to
jump at a victim, hence its other name, “jumping cactus.” Cholla spines
penetrate deeply and are very painful to remove; remember—people who
stay on the trail stay out of the way of the cholla. The noisy cactus
wren somehow makes use of the teddybear as a nesting site, and the
woodrat drags cholla joints home with which to barricade his burrow.",1483-1600,49192

rather proves and confirms it; for all Natures free power of moving and

it destroys the power of Immaterial substances, for Nature will not
be ruled nor governed by them, and to be against Natural Immaterial
substances, I think, is no Atheisme, except we make them Deities;
neither is Atheisme to contradict the opinion of those, that believe
such natural incorporeal Spirits, unless man make himself a God. But
although Nature is wise, as I said before, and acts methodically,
yet the variety of motions is the cause of so many Irregularities in
Nature, as also the cause of Irregular opinions; for all opinions are
made by self-moving matters motions, or (which is all one) by corporeal
self-motion, and some in their opinions do conceive Nature according
to the measure of themselves, as that Nature can, nor could not do
more, then they think, nay, some believe they can do as much as Nature
doth; which opinions, whether they be probable or regular, I'le let
any man judg; adding onely this, that to humane sense and reason it
appears plainly, that as God has given Nature a power to act freely, so

have added that, sadly, it was a life of many failures and frustrations,

larger vision that underlay _The Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ is now merely
a historical curiosity, the specific reforms that Dury advocated, as
seemingly impractical in his own time as his other schemes, proved to be
of lasting importance. Shorn of the millenarian vision that gave them
their point in Dury's own day, his ideas have become the accepted
standards of modern librarianship. Dury himself would not have been
heartened by his secular acceptance: ""... For except Sciences bee

to spend money.”

“Always so,” responded another, who belonged to the same antediluvian
class; “I’ve seed it many a time.”

There was quite a general assent to this proposition among the group. The idea of the first speaker was, that because he possessed money, his
sole duty was to keep it, and that gentlemen farmers were great
simpletons for doing otherwise; never for a moment imagining that if for
himself it were a luxury to hoard, it might be with the others a still
greater luxury to spend. In many neighborhoods, the advent of a gentleman farmer is not hailed
with genuine hospitality. He is too often regarded as a foolish man,
because he spends his money freely, even though it be scattered among
the sneering crowd.",1800-1900,48753

themselves the exalted title of being the spiritual life and the
perfect life. Meanwhile the commandments of God, according to each
one's calling, were without honor namely, that the father brought up his
offspring, that the mother bore children, that the prince governed
the commonwealth,--these were accounted works that were worldly and
imperfect, and far below those glittering observances. And this error
greatly tormented devout consciences, which grieved that they were
held in an imperfect state of life, as in marriage, in the office of

"It was the first moment of real positive
enjoyment she had tasted since she left Empton, and a feeling like
renewed life seemed to seize upon her senses. Without reasoning about
it, she had felt, during the last few months, as if it were her fate to
be unhappy, and that all she had to do was to submit; but, to her equal
delight and astonishment, she now found that nobody ever was so much
mistaken, for that she was one of the most particularly happy people in
the world, wanting nothing but sun, sweet air, and a lovely landscape,
to make her forget that such a thing as sorrow existed; and the only
thought that threw a shadow upon the brightness of her spirit, was that
which suggested that she must have been very wicked to have doubted for
a moment the goodness of God, who had formed this beautiful world on
purpose to make people happy. But, though every moment of such an hour as this seems to leave its own
sweet and lasting impression on the memory, the whole is soon gone; and
when Mary, with the wisdom called for by being the eldest of the party,
jumped up, exclaiming that they had quite forgotten their appointment to
meet her mother on the down, Agnes roused herself with a sigh, as if she
had passed through a momentary trance. They met the rest of their party, however, though the order of the
meeting was changed, for it was our young set who encountered the others
on their return, after a ramble of half a mile or so towards the
turnpike, which it is probable had not been enlivened by any such
raptures as those felt by Agnes.",1800-1900,36561

Miss Harriet Ll--d, _at a Toy Shop,
           German-Street_

   ---------Born with every grace,
   Ev'n envy must applaud so fair a face;
   Such is her form as painters when they show
   Their utmost art, on naked limbs bestow. This pretty little smart girl, this true
lover of the sport, is at present in keeping
by a member of P--------t, not far
from St. James's; but not being suffi-
ciently _membered_ for her _lower house_, she
appropriates the greatest part of the
member's hard coin to support and keep
in good humour two favourites of her
own. The one a tender sprig of the
law, the other a jolly hearty looking
butcher; but still in spite of these three,
she has her _best apartment_ ready for any
one that is master of five guineas, and
will make her mistress of the same;
it is neatly ornamented with chestnut
coloured fringe, is snug and warm, and
when not _too warm_ (which we are told is
sometimes the case) very comfortable;
she is now only seventeen, her dark eyes
have much lustre and more meaning:
                                her

               ( 83 )

her limbs, tho' small, are well shaped,
covered with a skin fair as the swan's
neck, and soft as its down, they are
perfectly pliable, and form a thousand
true lovers knots, first to facilitate the
entrance into her _apartment_, and then
to keep the enraptured lodger there as

remarkable lady when I state that to prove that we are indebted to Bacon
for having enriched the English language, through the plays, with these
beautiful courtesies of speech, 'Good morrow,' 'Good day,' etc., she
carefully examined SIX THOUSAND WORKS ANTERIOR TO OR CONTEMPORARY WITH
BACON.' Dr. Abbott thought it judicious to 'hedge' about these six thousand
works, and await 'the all-knowing dictionary' of Dr. Murray and
the Clarendon Press. We have deemed it simpler to go to the first
Elizabethan phrase-book on our shelves, and that tiny volume, in its
very first phrase, shatters the mare's-nest of Mrs. Pott, Mr. Donnelly,
and Mr. Bucke. But why, being a great poet, should Bacon conceal the fact, and choose
as a mask a man whom, on the hypothesis of his ignorance, every one that
knew him must have detected as an impostor? Now, one great author did
choose to conceal his identity, though he never shifted the burden of
the 'Waverley Novels' on to Terry the actor.",1700-1800,2073

"The conclusion which we have now arrived at, that happiness is the
increasing consciousness of Self, leads us to reflect whether this
mental state is brought about solely by what is generally known as
“pleasures,” or whether some other feeling, not usually classed as
such, may not have the same effect. Man can enjoy only through action,
and all his happiness depends on action; but there may be a great deal
and very intense activity in spheres of experience to which the terms
pleasure and pain, in their physiological sense, do not apply. Indeed,
such activities may be present along with physical pain and mental
suffering, and yet the law hold good: that if these are of a nature to
exalt the consciousness of self, they may be a well-spring of
happiness under circumstances the most unfavorable. This explains a
passage of Epictetus which I thought over a long time before I
mastered its significance,――“Happiness is an _equivalent_ for all
troublesome things;” not that it excludes or abolishes them, but that
it is a compensation for them. This puts the whole art of happiness in
a different light.",1800-1900,57071

observing, that though surfaces will unavoidably be still included, yet
we must no longer confine ourselves to the particular notice of them as
surfaces only, as we heretofore have done; we must now open our view to
general, as well as particular bulk and solidity; and also look into
what may have filled up, or given rise thereto, such as certain _given_
quantities and dimensions of parts, for inclosing any substance, or for
performing of _motion, purchase, stedfastness,_ and other matters of
use to living beings, which, I apprehend, at length, will bring us to a

this Age, that we have been industrious in finding out new Species of
Wickedness, and that we never commit an old Fault, but for want of
Invention to diversify the Crime, and heighten the Relish of Iniquity by
the horrid Novelty of it; and that we are so far from pretending to act
thro' Ignorance or want of Knowledge of our Duty, that the greatest
Pleasure of our Iniquities consists in our Knowledge of their being
prohibited by God, and destructive of our future and eternal Happiness. An
universal Depravation of Manners reigns thro' all Sorts of People in this

"In face of these facts it can scarcely be maintained that average
temperature is the efficient cause of the particular tone of colour

that climate counts for much in determining the distribution. It is
noticeable that though the pale _egerides_ can be established in a
warm climate we never find _egeria_ in cold climates, and even the
intermediate is not found in places that have a hard winter. I suspect
that the distribution of the broods through the year and the condition
of the animal at the onset of hard frost are features which really
determine whether a strain can live in a particular place or not. Though the truth of the suggestion cannot be tested by experiments in
captivity, which at once introduce disturbances, I incline to the idea
that _egeria_ has not got the right periodicity for northern climates.",1900-2000,44582

new costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,
courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who had

the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you will be

Unionists rapidly and generally slide into sabotage and personal
violence. The No-Conscriptionists of Ireland threaten through Mr.

probity were chosen as deputies, and among these, Frazer, Bishop of St.

matched; wherefore he hath need of your aid."" ""Well,"" said the King,

our host, arose from his being what is known by the name of _cura y

lowlands, along the Salt River floodplain where they could easily
irrigate their fields. Though the area may seem inhospitable, the
river’s flow is reliable—and water is an extremely precious resource in
the arid Southwest. The great range of elevation nearby provides several
life zones of various plants and animals to be utilized for richer
living. Ponderosa pine forests and juniper-pinyon pine woodland both

that she, herself, had not sufficient power to do this; that she was most
anxious to arrange this, if she could; but anyhow, that she could make
him Duc de Montpensier, with a private uncontrolled income of five
hundred thousand livres. He asked if, on the family coat-of-arms, the husband's coronet was to
figure, or the wife's; but, as she would not change her name, her arms,
she decided, could remain as heretofore,--the crown, the fleur-de-lis,
and so forth. He inquired if the children of the marriage would rank as princes, and
she said that she saw nothing to prevent this. He also asked if he would
be raised higher in the peerage, and might look to being made a prince at

morning, its mighty head arose, sole visible proof that the earth still
slept beneath. He had seen it at noon--but little less majestic, among

the flesh, with the affections and lusts"" (Gal. v. 24). These works, however, must not be done with any notion that by them a
man can be justified before God--for faith, which alone is righteousness
before God, will not bear with this false notion--but solely with this
purpose: that the body may be brought into subjection, and be purified
from its evil lusts, so that our eyes may be turned only to purging away
those lusts. For when the soul has been cleansed by faith and made to
love God, it would have all things to be cleansed in like manner, and
especially its own body, so that all things might unite with it in the
love and praise of God. Thus it comes that, from the requirements of his
own body, a man cannot take his ease, but is compelled on its account
to do many good works, that he may bring it into subjection.",1483-1600,1911

one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at

"Truth or Falsehood always supposes Affirmation or Negation. Though, in compliance with the ordinary way of speaking, I have shown in
what sense and upon what ground our ideas may be sometimes called true
or false; yet if we will look a little nearer into the matter, in all
cases where any idea is called true or false, it is from some JUDGMENT
that the mind makes, or is supposed to make, that is true or false. For
truth or falsehood, being never without some affirmation or negation,
express or tacit, it is not to be found but where signs are joined or
separated, according to the agreement or disagreement of the things they
stand for. The signs we chiefly use are either ideas or words; wherewith
we make either mental or verbal propositions. Truth lies in so joining
or separating these representatives, as the things they stand for do in
themselves agree or disagree; and falsehood in the contrary, as shall be
more fully shown hereafter.",1600-1700,10615

been noticed, and before I was in the water a minute a crowd of women

them away, and so I had to get out and dress under the fire of their

"He likewise declined the operation,
for the same reason which had been assigned by the former: however, such
was her resolution, backed with pain, that he was obliged to make the

operation; for, after having put my poor wife to inexpressible torment,
he was obliged to leave her tooth in statu quo; and she had now the
comfortable prospect of a long fit of pain, which might have lasted
her whole voyage, without any possibility of relief. In these pleasing
sensations, of which I had my just share, nature, overcome with fatigue,
about eight in the evening resigned her to rest--a circumstance which
would have given me some happiness, could I have known how to employ
those spirits which were raised by it; but, unfortunately for me, I
was left in a disposition of enjoying an agreeable hour without the
assistance of a companion, which has always appeared to me necessary to
such enjoyment; my daughter and her companion were both retired sea-sick
to bed; the other passengers were a rude school-boy of fourteen years
old and an illiterate Portuguese friar, who understood no language but
his own, in which I had not the least smattering. The captain was the
only person left in whose conversation I might indulge myself; but
unluckily, besides a total ignorance of everything in the world but a
ship, he had the misfortune of being so deaf, that to make him hear, I
will not say understand, my words, I must run the risk of conveying them

"No one but a
thoroughly good fisher could have summed up the art of playing a
fish in the words—“kepe hym euer vnder the rodde, and euermore holde
hym streyghte : soo that your lyne may susteyne and beere his lepys
and his plungys wyth the helpe of your croppe & of your honde.” The
place, the time of day, and the weather in which to fish, are next
particularly described after the exactitude peculiar to fishing
manuals of the olden time. These paragraphs are well worth the
consideration of a modern angler, especially the charge, “yf the
wynde be in the Eest, that is worste For comynly neyther wynter nor
somer y^e fysshe woll not byte thenne.”

The following part of the treatise, with what baits and how to angle
for each kind of fish, together with a brief description of each,
certainly furnished Walton with a model for some of his chapters. This portion of her book is regarded by the authoress as most
necessary to be known and proficiency in carrying out her rules “is
all the effecte of the crafte.” She adds amusingly, “for ye can
not brynge an hoke in to a fyssh mouth wythout a bayte.” A few of
the quaint receipts of her age succeed; how to keep live baits, to
make pastes and the like, ending with a rule which is often given
to flyfishers for trout at the present day: “Whan ye haue take a
grete fysshe : vndo the mawe, & what ye fynde therin make that your
bayte : for it is beste.”

Just as the authoress rises to eloquence at the beginning of the
treatise when comparing the fisher’s happy life with the toils and
troubles which too often fall to the lot of the hunter, hawker, and
fowler, so the end of these rules once more recalls her enthusiasm.",1483-1600,57943

mine in not drawing any conclusion from a deed in which certain lands are
mentioned as ""heretofore _the inheritance_ of William Shakspeare, Gent.,

in question came to Shakspeare by descent, as heir-at-law of his father. This opinion appeared to me to be somewhat a hasty one: believing that no
conclusion whatever is to be drawn from the phrase as there used, and
relying on the ordinary definition of _inheritance_ in the old works on

the moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone, have not given
it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme
scoundrel of the Renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his
shame. The opinions, the character, the achievements of the man, matter
very little. He may be a sceptic like the gentle Sieur de Montaigne, or
a saint like the bitter son of Monica, but when he tells us his own

"I must confess the imitating our manufactures has been carried further in
France than in any other part of the world, and yet we do not see they
have been able so to affect the consumption as to have any visible
influence upon our trade; or, that we abate the quantity which we usually
made, but that if they have checked the export at all, we have still found
other channels of trade which have fully carried off our quantity, and
shall still do so, though other nations were able to imitate us to, and
this is very particularly stated and explained by the author of the book
above mentioned, called the Plan of the English Commerce, where the
extending our manufactures is handled more at large than I have room for
in the narrow compass of this tract, and therefore I again refer my reader
thither, as to the fountain head. But I go on to touch the heads of things. The French do imitate our
manufactures in a better manner, and in greater quantity than other
nations; and why do we not prevent them? It is a terrible satire upon our
vigilance, or upon the method of our custom-house men, that we do not
prevent it; seeing the French themselves will not stick to acknowledge,
that without a supply of our wool, which is evident they have now with
very small difficulty from Ireland, they could do little in it, and indeed
nothing at all to the purpose. On the other hand, it is not so with France in regard to their silk
manufactures, in which although we have not the principles of the work, I
mean the silk growing within our dominions, but are obliged to bring it
from Italy, yet we have so effectually shut out the French silk
manufactures from our market, that in a word we have no occasion at all
for them; nay, if you will believe some of our manufacturers, the French
buy some of our wrought silks and carry them into France; but whether the
particular be so in fact or no, this I can take upon me from good evidence
to affirm, that whereas we usually imported in the ordinary course of
trade, at least a million to twelve hundred thousand pounds' value a year
in wrought silks from France; now we import so little as is not worth
naming; and yet it is allowed that we do not wear less silk, or silks of a
meaner value, than we usually did before, so that all the difference is
clear gain on the English side in the balance of trade.",1700-1800,32384

"The Medicine so much celebrated in _Germany_, and so frequently
commended and used in Practice by the late famous Professor
_Hoffman_, under the Title of his _Liquor Mineralis Anodynus_, was
nearly of the same Nature with the AETHER, but not so powerful,
nor so highly subtilized. Repeated Experience has confirmed the Efficacy of this Medicine in
all the Diseases before mentioned; and from the Consideration of
it's uncommon Qualities, it may be presumed to be an excellent
Remedy in many others, if judiciously given: Hence it seems
surprising that so valuable an Addition, to the _Materia Medica_
as the AETHER doubtless is, should have been so much neglected, or
so little known; but the Reasons are, that the Process whereby it
was made was kept secret by some who rated the Preparation at a
very extravagant Price, and not sufficiently attended to by
others, who consider'd it only as a Chemical Curiosity, not as a
Medicine. The chief Merit the Publisher of this Account pretends
to, is, _the ascertaining the Medicinal Virtues of this curious
Preparation_, by several Years Experience, and making them more
publickly known; _the reducing it's Price_, which has hitherto
been so extravagant that had it's Virtues and Properties been
known, only a small number of the afflicted could have enjoy'd the
Benefit of it; and, _the bringing it to a greater Degree of
Perfection than any hitherto sold_; what he offers being a
perfectly rectified Vitriolic AETHER. It may not be improper to give the Marks by which good AETHER may

to undertake such burden because of the very long and toilsome journey,
that could not be made without grave discomforts and danger of life,

"What most wee wondred at, was the abundance of sweet-Meats; and

halfe a dozen Boxes of Conserve of Quinces, and other fruits, besides
our Biskets, to stay our stomackes in the mornings and at other times
of the day; for in our stomackes we found a great difference betweene
_Spain_ and that Countrey. For in _Spain_ and other parts of _Europe_
a mans stomack will hold out from meale to meale, and one meale here
of good cheer will nourish and cherish the stomack foure and twenty
houres; But in _Mexico_ and other parts of _America_ wee found that two
or three houres after a good meale of three or foure severall dishes of
Mutton, Veale or Beefe, Kid, Turkies, or other Fowles, our stomackes
would bee ready to faint, and so wee were faine to support them with
either a cup of _Chocolatte_, or a bit of Conserve or Bisket, which
for that purpose was allowed us in great abundance. This seemed to mee
so strange, (whereas the meat seemed as fat and hearty, excepting the
Beefe, as ours in _Europe_) that I for some satisfaction presently
had recourse to a Doctor of Physick; who cleared my doubt with this
answer, That though the meat we fed on was as faire to looke on, as in
_Spain_; yet the substance and nourishment in it came farre short of
it, by reason of the pasture, which is dryer and hath not the change of
springs which the pastures of _Europe_ have, but is short and withers
soone away. But secondly, hee told mee that the Climate of those
parts had this effect, to produce a faire shew, but little matter or
substance. As in the flesh wee fed on; so likewise in all the fruits
there, which are most faire and beautifull to behold, most sweet and
luscious to taste, but little inward virtue or nourishment at all in
them, not halfe that is in a _Spanish Camuesa_, or _English Kentish_

"Fears or objections against an opinion are unimportant as follows:
(a) if they have only a slight probability (e.g., Titus opines that he
is not obliged to say the second lessons, because he knows that he
began them, and therefore must have said them; but he fears he may be
obliged to say them, because he cannot remember the details of the
lessons, and hence has probably not said them); (b) if they are
improbable (e.g., Caius fears that he may have omitted Sext, although
he recalls going to choir to chant at the regular times.) 665. Fears against an opinion are important, when they are not merely

1,400 men, and that these were divided at Jora Bridge, in Lessö,

which took the road through Gudbrandsdalen. The same Saga says that
the division which went through Österdalen came across the Norsemen
at the frontier, when a battle ensued, in which those Scots were
shot down to the last man. But that Saga is not generally current;
and it appears probable that Munkhaven's expedition, or possibly
some other event, has been mixed up in the narrative. [65] It appears
that Sinclair had calculated on joining the Swedes in Southern
Norway, where, however, we know from history there were no Swedes
at that time; for Jonas Ramus states[66] that, from Gudbrandsdalen,

"It
is so because it can thereby be proved that, seeing that these relations
have materially changed in the previous course of human development, and
that the changes have taken place in even step with the existing systems
of production, on the one hand, and of the distribution of the product
of labor, on the other, it is natural and goes without saying that,
along with further changes and revolutions in the system of production
and distribution, _the relations between the sexes are bound to change
again_. Nothing is ""eternal,"" either in nature or in human life; eternal
only is change and interchange. As far back as one may go in the development of human society, the horde
is found as the first human community. True enough, Honeger mentions in
his ""General History of Civilization"" that even to-day in the little
explored interior of the island of Borneo, there are wild people, living
separately; and Huegel likewise maintains that, in the wild mountain

furthest away from and to be most foreign to material life. Religion
arose at a very remote period of human development, in the savage state,
from certain erroneous and barbaric conceptions of men with regard to
themselves and the outside world of nature around them. Every
ideological notion develops, however, when once it has arisen; it grows
by additions to the given idea, and develops it further, otherwise
there would be no ideology, that is, no occupation with thoughts as with
independent thought-existence, developing independently and subject only
to its own laws. That the material conditions of life of the men within
whose heads this thought force is at work finally determine the course
of this thought-process necessarily remains still unknown to these men,
otherwise there would be an entire end of the ideology.",1900-2000,27814

Judgment is awake it regulates the Imagination, which runs at random

sounding, and well knowing how near the Ships could lay their
Broadsides against it, they certainly judged right in abandoning it,

he had grown, I gathered from his simple talk, to have a great love of
the earth, the lives of flocks and herds, and of all the plants that
grew out of the earth or flourished in it. I had thought before, in a
foolish way, that all this might be put away from the spirit, in the
land where there was no need of such things; but I saw now that there
was a claim for labour, and a love of common things, which did not
belong only to the body, but was a real desire of the spirit. He spoke
of the pleasures of tending cattle, of cutting fagots in the forest
woodland among the copses, of ploughing and sowing, with the breath of
the earth about one; till I saw that the toil of the world, which I had
dimly thought of as a thing which no one would do if they were not
obliged, was a real instinct of the spirit, and had its counterpart

this can be accomplished, unless by the agency of arteries, would, I
imagine, be no easy task to point out. The influence discovered by Galvani appeared to me an admirable test,
by which something decisive might be ascertained relative to these
important points in the physiology of animals, and as such I have
employed it in the following experiments. Considering, therefore, the brain on the one hand, and the sanguiferous

with very sharp stakes driven into the soil, and placed among the
branches of the trees many crossbows, [54] in order that these,
being discharged as our men passed them, might wound the soldiers;
and above they provided many stones to throw at the Spaniards,
hurling them from the top of the hill. Six months later the same Don
Juan Alcarazo returned, to dislodge those rebels with forty Spaniards
and many Indians. After suffering great hardships in making the paths
accessible, nearly all his men were hurt, by the time they reached the
fort, by the many stones which the enemy hurled down from the summit;
but our soldiers courageously climbed the ascent, firing their muskets,
and killed many of the rebels, putting the rest to flight. Thus was

taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him,
and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick. ""All that is very well,"" said Don Quixote; ""but let the shoes and the
blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him
without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid
for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from
him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that

The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what
was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had
fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper
had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling

with a sea-voyage, nor with a voyage across ice to the borders of
some northern sea, but with a journey during which the voyagers were
throughout surrounded as far as the eye could reach by apparently fixed
ice-fields. In 1827 Sir Edward Parry was commissioned by the English Government to
attempt to reach the North Pole. A large reward was promised in case
he succeeded, or even if he could get within five degrees of the North
Pole. The plan which he adopted seemed promising. Starting from a port
in Spitzbergen, he proposed to travel as far northward as possible in
sea-boats, and then, landing upon the ice, to prosecute his voyage by
means of sledges.",1800-1900,54455

government, Socinios had earnestly recommended to him, and he had most
solemnly promised, to protect the Catholic religion in his province,
and seemingly for this purpose he had taken with him a Jesuit named
Francisco de Carvalho. Another affair which the king particularly charged him with was, the
care of a caravan which once a-year came from Narea. This, besides many
other valuable articles for the merchant, brought 1000 wakeas of gold
as tribute to the king, equal to about 10,000 dollars, or crowns of

"To his intense relief, that scheme was
dropped. Soon after this, the king died, and Queen Anne, the daughter
of Penn's friend and guardian, James II., ascended the throne. He
once more enjoyed royal favour in a marked degree. He was chosen to
present to the Queen the Quaker address, thanking her for promising
to maintain the Act of Toleration. After the address was read, ""Mr.

"The truth is, that while I
was leading this busy life, in a retirement that might compare with that
of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except the servants of the
house (for when I went to Mass it was so early in the morning, and I was
so closely attended by my mother and the women of the household, and so
thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes scarcely saw more ground than I
trod on), in spite of all this, the eyes of love, or idleness, more
properly speaking, that the lynx's cannot rival, discovered me, with the
help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for that is the name of the
younger son of the duke I told of."" The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio
changed colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that
the curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad
fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but
Cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the
peasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was. She, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her
story, went on to say:

""And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he was
smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it displayed
itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will
pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for
declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household, he gave and
offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday or
a merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music;
the love letters that used to come to my hand, no one knew how, were
innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges, containing more
promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only
did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as if he had been
my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me yield were done
with the opposite intention.",1600-1700,5912

"They will, however, require air in the night, generally till
the fruit is cut, and even then if the weather is mild; for by being
kept close at night when there is a strong heat, the fruit is liable to
change colour and become of a yellow cast. The plants should be uncovered in a morning by eight o'clock, or nine at
farthest, in the winter, and six or seven as the season advances, unless
the weather is very cold or windy, when they may remain an hour longer
than usual. Should the frame be infested with woodlice, place some cabbage-leaves or
a small quantity of hay in the bed, which will answer the purpose of a
trap to collect them, when they may be easily destroyed by boiling
water. Care, however, is necessary in this expedient, for should the
plants have taken root at the side of the box, the hot water will
materially injure them; but if the plants are kept healthy, little
danger is to be apprehended from this description of vermin, as they
always like a sickly stagnated plant to a thriving vigorous one.",1700-1800,27548

her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper
form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at

believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos,
where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress
and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to
please myself. It must be all exactly the other way, as your ladyship
says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a
cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I think my master is
so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could be made to believe
a thing so out of all reason. But, senora, your excellence must not

the place it's in, not by the look of the brick. If it was knowledge,

"_A Work of_ Saturn

_In the Name of the Lord_, Amen. My Child shall know, that the Stone called the _Philosophers Stone_,
comes out of _Saturn_. And therefore when it is perfected, it makes
projection, as well in mans Body from all Diseases, which may assault
them either within or without, be they what they will, or called by what
name soever, as also in the imperfect Metals. And know, my Child, for a Truth, that in the whole vegetable work there
is no higher nor greater Secret than in _Saturn_; for we do not find
that perfection in Gold which is in _Saturn_; for internally it is good
Gold, herein all Philosophers agree, and it wants nothing else, but that
first you remove what is superfluous in it, that is, its impurity, and
make it clean, and then that you turn its inside outwards, which is its
redness, then will it be good Gold; for Gold cannot be made so easily,
as you can of _Saturn_, for _Saturn_ is easily dissolved and congealed,
and its _Mercury_ may be easily extracted, and this _Mercury_ which is
extracted from _Saturn_, being purified and sublimed, as _Mercury_ is
usually sublimed, I tell thee, my Child, that the same _Mercury_ is as
good as the _Mercury_ which is extracted out of Gold, in all operations;
for if _Saturn_ be Gold internally, as in truth it is, then must its
_Mercury_ be as good as the _Mercury_ of Gold, therefore I tell you,
that _Saturn_ is better in our work than Gold; for if you should extract
the _Mercury_ out of Gold, it would require a years space to open the
body of Gold, before you can extract the _Mercury_ out of the Gold, and
you may extract the _Mercury_ out of _Saturn_ in 14 days, both being
alike good.",1600-1700,26340

"The king's sister Jahamel would also have taken Patty

Jahamel, was received in her room. ""Upon my father's return to Arndrumnstake, he found no less than fifteen
expresses from several colambs, desiring to rejoice with him on the
return of his daughter, with particular invitations to him and her to
spend some time with them. My father, though he hates more pomp than
is necessary to support dignity, could do no less than severally visit
them, with Youwarkee, attended by a grand retinue, spending more or less
days with each; hoping when that was over, he should have some little
time to spend in retirement with his daughter before her departure, who
now began to be uneasy for you, who, she said, would suffer the greatest
concern in her absence: but upon their return from those visits, at
about the end of four months' progress, they found themselves in as
little likelihood of retirement as the first day; for the inferior
colambs were continually posting away, one after another, to perform
their respects to my father, and all the inferior magistrates of smaller
districts sending to know when they might be permitted to do the same. Poor Youwarkee, who saw no end of it, expressed her concern for you in
so lively a manner to my father, that finding he could by no means put
a stop to the goodwill of the people, and not bearing the thoughts of
You-warkee's departure till she had now received all their compliments,
he resolved to keep her with him till the next winter set in in these
parts, and then to accompany her himself to Graundevolet.",1700-1800,51967

and men in middle life had never known what the word Peace meant. Perhaps
they could hardly imagine such a condition. This is easily said, but it
is difficult really to picture to ourselves the moral constitution of a
race of mankind which had been born and had grown up, marrying and giving
in marriage, dying and burying their dead, and so passing on from the
cradle towards the grave, accepting the eternal clang of arms, and the

called to be heirs of the same salvation with us, lose their lives, and
are, truly and properly speaking, murdered every year! For it is not
necessary, in order to convict a man of murder, to make it appear that
he had an _intention_ to commit murder; whoever does, by unjust force or
violence, deprive another of his liberty, and, while he hath him in his
power, continues so to oppress him by cruel treatment, as eventually to
occasion his death, is actually guilty of murder.",1700-1800,11489

"XXXVI.--_Observations upon Benzoic Acid, and its Combinations with
Salifiable Bases[48]._

This acid was known to the ancient chemists under the name of Flowers of
Benjamin, or of Benzoin, and was procured, by sublimation, from the gum
or resin called Benzoin: The means of procuring it, _via humida_, was
discovered by Mr Geoffroy, and perfected by Mr Scheele. Upon benzoin,
reduced to powder, pour strong lime-water, having rather an excess of
lime; keep the mixture continually stirring, and, after half an hour's
digestion, pour off the liquor, and use fresh portions of lime-water in
the same manner, so long as there is any appearance of neutralization. Join all the decanted liquors, and evaporate, as far as possible,
without occasioning cristallization, and, when the liquor is cold, drop
in muriatic acid till no more precipitate is formed. By the former part
of the process a benzoat of lime is formed, and, by the latter, the
muriatic acid combines with the lime, forming muriat of lime, which
remains dissolved, while the benzoic acid, being insoluble,
precipitates in a concrete state. SECT.",1700-1800,30775

existence of rascals

Idle questions which are commonly
addressed to a traveller

If this and if that, and every other if

If I could live my life over again

If history did not lie

Ignorance is bliss

Ignorant, who talk about everything
right or wrong

Imagine that what they feel themselves
others must feel

It is only fools who complain

It's too much for honour and too little
for love

Jealousy leads to anger, and anger goes
a long way

Knowing that he would not be regretted
after his death

Last thing which we learn in all
languages is wit

Laugh out of season

Let not thy right hand know what thy
left hand doeth

Lie a sufficient number of times, one
ends by believing it

Light come, light go

Love always makes men selfish

Look on everything we don't possess as
a superfluity

Love fills our minds with idle visions

Love makes no conditions

Made a point of forgetting everything
unpleasant

Made a parade of his Atheism

Man needs so little to console him or
to soothe his grief

Marriage without enjoyment is a thorn
without roses

Marriage state, for which I felt I had
no vocation

Married a rich wife, he repented of
having married at all

Most trifling services are assessed at
the highest rates

My spirit and my desires are as young

Mystical insinuations

Negligent attire

Never to pass an opinion on any subject

Never wearied himself with too much

agreed he was learned

'Non' is equal to giving the lie

Now I am too old to begin curing myself

Obscenity disgusts, and never gives
pleasure

Oh! wonderful power of self-delusion

One never knows enough

Owed all its merits to antithesis and
paradox

Pardonable weakness, most of us prefer
""mine"" to ""thine""

Passing infidelity, but not inconstancy

Passion and prejudice cannot reason

People did not want to know things as
they truly were

People want to know everything, and
they invent

Pigmies mimicking a giant

Pity to sell cheaply what would have to
be replaced dearly

Pleasures are realities, though all too
fleeting

Repentance for a good deed

Reproached by his wife for the money he
had expended

Rid of our vices more easily than of
our follies

Rome the holy, which thus strives to
make all men pederasts

Rumour is only good to amuse fools

Sad symptom of misery which is called a
yawn

Sadness is a disease which gives the
death-blow to affection

Scold and then forgive

Scrupulously careful not to cheat you
in small things

Seldom praised and never blamed

Selfishness, then, the universal motor
of our actions? Shewed his contempt by saying nothing

Sin concealed is half pardoned

Sleep--the very likeness of
non-existence

Snatching from poor mortal man the
delusions

Soften the hardships of the slow but
certain passage to the grave

Stupid servant is more dangerous than a
bad one

'Sublata lucerna nullum discrimen inter
feminas'

Submissive gaze of a captive who
glories in his chain

Surface is always the first to interest

Talent of never appearing to be a
learned man

Taste and feeling

Tell me whether that contempt of life
renders you worthy of it

There is no cure for death

There's time enough for that

Time that is given to enjoyment is
never lost

Time that destroys marble and brass
destroys also the very memory

Time is a great teacher

Timidity is often another word for
stupidity

To know ill is worse than not to know
at all

Vengeance is a divine pleasure

Verses which, like parasites, steal
into a funeral oration

Victims of their good faith

Wash their dirty linen in private

What is love? When we can feel pity, we love no
longer

When one is in an ill humour,
everything is fuel for the fire

Whims of the mob and the fancies of the
Republic

Wife worthy of being a mistress

Wiser if they were less witty

Wish is father to the thought

Wit cannot stand before stupidity

Woman has in her tears a weapon

Women are always as old as they look

Women would be either tyrants or slaves

Women often do the most idiotic things
out of sheer obstinacy

World of memories, without a present
and without a future

Would like to shape the laws according
to their needs

Wretch treats me so kindly that I love

no longer sat his horse firmly, nor managed him with his wonted skill. Collecting all his strength for a last assault, he rose in his stirrups,
and made a violent thrust with his lance; the Alcayde received it upon
his shield, and at the same time wounded the Moor in the right arm; then
closing, in the shock, he grasped him in his arms, dragged him from his
saddle, and fell with him to the earth: when putting his knee upon his

thereof a Chart or description, principally in winter, where all is

while the salt freezeth or creameth there come any rain, it is so great
a retardment (and for fifteen dayes at the least) we must empty al the

in rainy and cold years, they can very hardly make it. In this regard, I come to remember an experiment that I have tried
more then once, which gave me to think whether it were _Aristotle_,
I tooke eight or ten pound of common grosse salt, which I made to
dissolve in hot water, scumming the froth which may be there, and
being left to settle, I put the clear by inclination in a caldron

houres, when it was cold I parted it into four platters of _Beuvais_

came not, and did choose a moist time to facilitate the dissolution,
recollecting every morning that which was resolved in water, so long,
that at the end of seven or eight dayes the salts dissolution was
perfected, nothing remaining but I know not what thicknesse or slime,
in a small quantity which I set apart, I put all my dissolutions into
_Cornues_ & distilled all the water which could mount, being very
fresh, for the saltnesse did not ascend, but remained fixt in the
bottome of the vessell, and gave at last a good estret of fire, with
staves of _Cotteret_, having broken the Cornues: I put the salt that
therein remained congealed to dissolve in moisture as before, till
there remained nothing but grossenesse and slime as in the former I
distilled that which ascended from the water, and reiterated all those
Regiments till all my salt was resolved and distilled into salt water,
that which came the seven or eight time. The slime I washed well with
water, to extract what might bee the Remainder of saltnesse; and so
recalcined and washt them till there rested nothing but slime or pure
earth without tast. Of this little salt that I had extracted, I did
as I had done with others, so that all my salt, without losing any

what is still preserved of the First Column. For after his reference to
the destruction of mankind, the deity proceeds to fix the chief duty

be concluded that he did not choose to be indebted to Shakespeare, or
despaired of rivalling him. His notice of his great contemporary in the
""Epistle to Reynolds"" is surprisingly cold; but the legend, however
unauthentic, of Shakespeare's death from a fever contracted at a
merry-making in Drayton's company, seems incompatible with any serious
estrangement, and Shakespeare's son-in-law was Drayton's physician when
the latter revisited his native Warwickshire. The same jealousy of
obligation must have influenced his treatment of the incident of the
Dauphin's derisive present of tennis balls, which both Shakespeare and
he have adopted from Holinshed or his authorities, but of which the
former has made everything and the latter nothing. Nor can the omission
of the highly dramatic incident of the conspiracy of Scroop and
Cambridge, found in Holinshed, be otherwise well accounted for. In
compensation, Drayton introduces two episodes entirely his own, the
catalogue of Henry's ships, and that of the armorial ensigns of the
British counties.",1700-1800,27770

holes or windows, rather than any striving for the preservation of its
natural solidity. The wall picture, “Vers La Gloire,” by the clever artist, Detaille, may
be mentioned as an example of work that has reached the limits of
misplaced decoration. This work, though no doubt very popular, is really
a crowded and complex miniature painting enlarged and transferred to the

"There is, indeed, no better cover for an orderly retreat than a
forest,--this statement being made upon the supposition that there are
at least two good roads behind the line, that proper measures for
retreat have been taken before the enemy has had an opportunity to press
too closely, and, finally, that the enemy is not permitted by a flank
movement to be before the retreating army at the outlet of the forest,
as was the case at Hohenlinden. The retreat would be the more secure if,
as at Waterloo, the forest formed a concave line behind the center; for
this re-entering would become a place of arms to receive the troops and
give them time to pass off in succession on the main roads. When discussing strategic operations, mention was made of the varying
chances which the two systems, the _defensive_ and the _offensive_, give
rise to; and it was seen that especially in strategy the army taking the
initiative has the great advantage of bringing up its troops and
striking a blow where it may deem best, whilst the army which acts upon
the defensive and awaits an attack is anticipated in every direction, is
often taken unawares, and is always obliged to regulate its movements by
those of the enemy. We have also seen that in tactics these advantages
are not so marked, because in this case the operations occupy a smaller
extent of ground, and the party taking the initiative cannot conceal his
movements from the enemy, who, instantly observing, may at once
counteract them by the aid of a good reserve.",1800-1900,13549

secular changes in the declination. In his time, as he tells us, the
variation of the compass at London was 11-1/3 degrees. What he did not
know was that this was a diminishing quantity which in fifty-seven
years would be reduced to zero, to be succeeded by a westward
declination that would last for nearly three hundred years.",1483-1600,45893

largely, relating to the question how one magnet influences another

Irresolubleness of Diamonds;[13] _Adamas_ (saith he) _omnium factus
Lapidum solidissimus ac durissimus ex arctissima videlicet trium
principiorum unione ac Cohaerentia, quae nulla arte separationis in
solutionem principiorum suorum spiritualium disjungi potest._ And
indeed, pursues _Eleutherius_, I was not only glad, but somewhat
surprized to find you inclined to Admit that there may be a Sulphur
and a running Mercury drawn from Gold; for unlesse you do (as your
expression seem'd to intimate) take the word Sulphur in a very loose
sence, I must doubt whether our Chymists can separate a Sulphur from
Gold: For when I saw you make the experiment that I suppose invited
you to speak as you did, I did not judge the golden Tincture to be the
true principle of Sulphur extracted from the body, but an aggregate of
some such highly colour'd parts of the Gold, as a Chymist would have
called a _Sulphur incombustible_, which in plain English seems to be
little better than to call it a Sulphur and no Sulphur. And as for
Metalline Mercuries, I had not _wondred_ at it, though you had
expressed much more severity in speaking of them: For I remember that
having once met an old and famous Artist, who had long been (and still
is) Chymist to a great Monarch, the repute he had of a very honest man
invited me to desire him to tell me ingenuously whether or no, among
his many labours, he had ever really extracted a true and running
Mercury out of Metalls; to which question he freely replyed, that he
had never separated a true Mercury from any Metal; nor had ever seen
it really done by any man else. And though Gold is, of all Metalls,
That, whose Mercury Chymists have most endeavoured to extract, and
which they do the most brag they have extracted; yet the Experienced
_Angelus Sala_, in his _Spagyrical_ account of the seven _Terrestrial_
Planets (that is the seven metalls) affords us this memorable
Testimony, to, our present purpose; _Quanquam_ (saies he) _&c. experientia tamen (quam stultorum Magistrum [Errata: Magistram]
vocamus) certe Comprobavit, Mercurium auri adeo fixum, maturum, &
arcte cum reliquis ejusdem corporis substantiis conjungi, ut nullo
modo retrogredi possit._ To which he sub-joynes, that he himself had
seen much Labour spent upon that Design, but could never see any such
Mercury produc'd thereby.",1600-1700,22914

habitual concrete pleasures in relation to their corresponding habits,
the irreducible difference in constructive interest as a type lies in
the _transition_ which this type of interest purposes and effects from

of their great extremity, made sail directly back again to Carthagena
with the whole fleet; where, having staid eight or ten days more about
the unlading of this ship and the bestowing thereof and her men into
other ships, we departed once again to sea, directing our course toward
the Cape St. Anthony, being the westermost part of Cuba, where we
arrived the 27th of April. But because fresh water could not presently
be found, we weighed anchor and departed, thinking in few days to
recover the Matanzas, a place to the eastward of Havana. After we had sailed some fourteen days we were brought to Cape St.
Anthony again through lack of favourable wind; but then our scarcity
was grown such as need make us look a little better for water, which we
found in sufficient quantity, being indeed, as I judge, none other than
rain-water newly fallen and gathered up by making pits in a plot of
marish ground some three hundred paces from the seaside. I do wrong if I should forget the good example of the General at this
place, who, to encourage others, and to hasten the getting of fresh
water aboard the ships, took no less pain himself than the meanest; as
also at St. Domingo, Carthagena, and all other places, having always
so vigilant a care and foresight in the good ordering of his fleet,
accompanying them, as it is said, with such wonderful travail of body,

he had yet deserved the first place of honour; and no less happy do
we account him for being associated with Master Carlile, his
Lieutenant-General, by whose experience, prudent counsel, and gallant
performance he achieved so many and happy enterprises of the war, by
whom also he was very greatly assisted in setting down the needful

books, composed in Arabic by their doctors, and translated into
Hebrew. This historian further informs us, that this sect is to be found in
Syria, and as far to the east as Nineveh, from which place, some years
ago, one of the Karaites came to Frankfort, in Germany. He brought
with him some books, which he valued at a very high price. He then

discursive reason, the two conceptions seem to be divided. This may
well represent the highest wisdom. But, the argument of these lectures
has a narrower scope: and when, in the course of them, I speak of God,
I mean something other than an Identity wherein all differences vanish,
or a Unity which includes but does not transcend the differences which
it somehow holds in solution. I mean a God whom men can love, a God to
whom men can pray, who takes sides, who has purposes and preferences,

far, we had no right to grumble if we were now treated to a few of the
inconveniences of such a voyage as ours. Though still making very good
way, we were not getting on so fast as we had been, our low canvas, and
the heavy sea (for a craft of our size) which began to get up, not
permitting us to do more than our seven knots. Still, this was remarkably good work, and we ought to have been

that he might possibly see his Sophia. These hopes had surely very
little foundation; but as the conduct of Mrs Fitzpatrick, in not
seeing him according to her promise, and in quitting her lodgings, had
been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived some faint hopes, that
she (of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical character) might
possibly intend to do him that service in a strange manner, which she
declined doing by more ordinary methods. To say the truth, as nothing
certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an incident, he
had the greater latitude to draw what imaginary conclusions from it he
pleased. As his temper therefore was naturally sanguine, he indulged

"LEBRET, first President of the Parliament, and Intendant of this
Province, a Gentleman zealous for its Preservation, and very active in his
Assistance in this time of Calamity, has done us the Honour frequently to
ask of us an exact Account of the Treatment of this Malady. _The Method used in treating the Sick of the First Class._

If we afford but the least Attention to the Nature of the Symptoms related
in the first Class, that is to say, to the small, unequal, and
concentrated Pulse; to the Shiverings; to the universal Chilliness,
especially in the extreme Parts, and to the almost continual Sickness at
the Stomach; to those Lead-coloured, dismal and cadaverous Faces; it will
be very easy to judge, that we have nothing to do in this Case, but to
prescribe the most active and generous Cordials; such as are _Venice_
Treacle, Diascordium, the Extract of Juniper Berries, the _Lilium_; the
Confection of Hyacinth, of Alkermes; the Elixirs drawn from Substances
that abound the most in a volatile Salt; the Treacle Waters, those of
Juniper Berries of Carmes; the volatile Salts of Vipers, of Armoniack, of
Hartshorn; the Balms the most spirituous; in one Word, all that is capable
to animate, excite and strengthen; augmenting, doubling, and even tripling
their ordinary Dose, according as the Case shall be more or less pressing. All these Remedies, and others of the same Nature, are without doubt very
proper to animate and raise the almost extinguished Strength of these poor
sick Persons; nevertheless we have with Grief seen almost all of them
perish on a sudden, which presently confirmed us in the Opinion generally
received, that the Malignity of the pestilential Ferment is of a Force
superior to all Remedies; but as we have also seen them succeed in some
particular Cases, there is Room to presume, and one is but too much
convinced of it by fatal Experience, that the Desertion and Inactivity of
the greatest Part of the People who might have given Assistance, that the
Want of Nourishment, of Remedies and Attendance, that the fatal Prejudice
of being seized by an incurable Distemper, that the Despair of seeing ones
self abandoned without any Relief, one is, I say, well convinced that all
these Causes have not less contributed than the Violence of the Disease,
to the sudden Destruction of so great a Number of the Sick, not only of
this first Class, but also of the following; seeing that in Proportion as
this mortal Fear of the Contagion is diminished, and that one is mutually
assisted, that the Hopes and Courage of the People are returned; that, in
one Word, the good Order is re-established in this City by the Authority,
Firmness and Vigilance of the Chevalier _de_ LANGERON, by the great Care
of the Governor, and by the constant and indefatigable Endeavours of the
Sheriffs; one has beheld the Progress and Violence of this terrible
_Scourge_ to diminish insensibly, and we have been more successful in
curing the infected. Returning then to the Method proposed to treat the sick Persons of this
First Class, supposing that by the Remedies mentioned, we were able to
revive their dying Forces, and to disengage them from the sad Condition
described above, it would remain to examine with Attention the new Changes
and Accidents that would arise, which according to our Observations, may
be reduced to some of those we have related under the following Classes,
and ought by consequence to be treated by some of the Methods which we
shall now deliver. _The Method used in treating the Sick of the Second Class._

The Treatment of the Sick of this Second Class has much more employed us
than the preceding, in respect to the Multiplicity and Variety of
Accidents that offer at the same time several Indications to satisfy.",1700-1800,31548

pleasure of God, and he should reason thus:--

"The Emperor spoke of the
case of the _Dacia_ with some bitterness, but when I went
into an explanation the Chancellor joined in the conversation
and said that our position was undoubtedly correct. I said that
it was not our business to break the blockade--that there were
plenty of German agents in the United States who could send food
ships and test the question; that one ship I knew of, the
_Wilhelmina_, laden with food, had been seized by the British,
who then compromised with the owners, paying them, I believed, a
large sum for the disputed cargo. And in taking up the doctrine
of ultimate destination of goods, i.e., goods sent to a neutral
country but really destined for a belligerent, I said I thought
that during our Civil War we had taken against England exactly
the same stand which England now took; and I said I thought that
one of the decisions of our Supreme Court was based on a shipment
to Matamoras, Mexico, but which the Supreme Court had decided
was really for the Confederacy. Discussing the submarine question, the Emperor and Chancellor
spoke of the warning given in the _Lusitania_ case; and
I said: ""If the Chancellor warns me not to go out on the
Wilhelmplatz, where I have a perfect right to go, the fact that
he gave the warning does not justify him in killing me if I
disregarded his warning and go where I have a right to go.""",1900-2000,7238

Josephus and the author of the First Book of Maccabees. The writers of
both histories give a synopsis of the letter sent by Oreus, king of
the Lacedemonians, to Onias, the High Priest of Israel. The two
accounts agree very closely. Josephus gives the opening clause of the
king's letter in these terms: ""We have met with a certain writing
whereby we have discovered that both Jews and Lacedemonians are of one
stock, and are derived from the kindred of Abraham.""",1800-1900,49375

emotions of impatience that I had ever known; and obliged our driver to
put his mules to the full gallop, in the apprehension that it would be
dark before we reached the place. I expected to find the building, in
some measure, ruinous; but was agreeably disappointed, to see it look
as fresh as the bridge at Westminster. The climate is either so pure
and dry, or the free-stone, with which it is built, so hard, that the
very angles of them remain as acute as if they had been cut last year. Indeed, some large stones have dropped out of the arches; but the whole
is admirably preserved, and presents the eye with a piece of
architecture, so unaffectedly elegant, so simple, and majestic, that I
will defy the most phlegmatic and stupid spectator to behold it without
admiration. It was raised in the Augustan age, by the Roman colony of
Nismes, to convey a stream of water between two mountains, for the use
of that city.",1700-1800,2311

called, the house-dressmaker. The return to better principles of design will do more than anything
else to restore the architectural lines of the room. Those who use
portieres generally do so from an instinctive feeling that a door is
an ugly thing that ought to be hidden, and modern doors are in fact
ugly; but when architects give to the treatment of openings the same
attention they formerly received, it will soon be seen that this

"To him life without wealth--not for its own
sake, but for what it gives and hinders--was merely a sentence of penal
servitude. Raymond had always been poor, he knew; but poverty in the
antique splendor of decayed ancestral halls, with the necessaries of
life provided as by a law of nature, and in the midst of a loyal and
reverent peasantry, was a very different sort of poverty from what he was
now embarking on. He would sometimes fix his eyes on Raymond when he was
busying himself, with apparently great satisfaction, on some miserable
trifle that Angélique wanted done in her room or in the kitchen, and
wonder whether it was genuine or feigned, whether sorrow or philosophy
had so deadened him to external conditions as to make him indifferent to
the material meanness and miseries of his position. He never heard a word
of regret, or any expression that could be construed into regret, escape
him in their most familiar conversations. Once Raymond, in speaking of
poverty, had confessed that he had never believed it had any power to
make men unhappy--such poverty as his had been--until he felt the touch

pretty Senorita, he could not but confess that he entertained a sincere
regard for her. A great love, such as he had felt for the Princess
Ottilie, for instance, could never come to him again; but he asked
himself why, if it were true that he had decided never to return to his
old life, he should not choose a wife from the people with whom he had
thrown in his lot, and settle down to a quiet married life in his new
home? Moreover, he was quite aware that Montezma was anxious that his
daughters should marry, and he felt confident enough of the old man's

paramount authority over the colonies. Sir Edmund Andros, a worthy minion of a tyrant, was chosen

A LEGEND OF GOAT ISLAND




    It is told in Indian story,
    Dim tradition of the race,
    How, to God's eternal glory,
    And through His all-saving grace,
    Many a warrior's heart was stirred
    To belief in His ever-living Word,
    And the Faith that saves us all,
    By a Priest, whose holy mission
    Overcame their superstition
    About the Island, which divides
    Niagara's tumultuous tides,
    At the brink of the mighty Fall.",1800-1900,53002
"'Why, how do you do, Uncle Stanley, glad to see you--how does the
     poultry ranch prosper? By the way, have you moved to Alki Point
     yet?' 'O, yes, I took my traps, poultry and all, over there
     several days ago, and had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Plummer
     there. Did he mention the circumstances?'",1900-2000,39334
"[13] Monstrum illud hominis, diis inferis a secretis scelus, nefarii
illius tractatus de tribus impostoribus author quantumvis ab omni
Religione alienus, adeo ut nec Judaeus, nec Turca, nec Christianus
fuerit, plane tamen athoeus non erat. [14] Consult Bayle's Dictionary on this subject, article, ""Trabea."" [15] Quid vel hac sola dubitatione in Christiana schola cogitara

"They admit it is certainly so sometimes, and that it is difficult to
reject the conclusion that it is always so. Dr. Bostock--who, doubtless,
had not met with Dewees' theory at the time he wrote, and who admits
it impossible to conceive how the semen can find its way along the
Fallopian tubes, how it can find its way toward the ovary, farther, at
most, than into the uterus, and, consequently, cannot see how the ovum
can be impregnated into the ovary--says, ""Perhaps the most rational
supposition may be that the ovum is transmitted to the uterus in the
unimpregnated state; but there are certain facts which seem almost
incompatible with this idea, especially the cases which not infrequently
occur of perfect foetuses having been found in the tubes, or where they
escaped them into the cavity of the abdomen. Hence it is demonstrated
the ovum is occasionally impregnated in the tubes (why did he not say
ovaria? ), and we can scarcely resist the conclusion that it must always
be the case.""... ""Haller discusses this hypothesis (Bostock's 'most
natural supposition, perhaps') and decides against it.""...",1800-1900,38185
"P. I put you out of doubt, it is a wonderful nature of the countrey. Bertulphe. P. Yea, this doe they in deede: whereas there bee sometime there, that
drink two times somuche in wine, as they paye in all for the shot. But
before I doe make an end of this Supper, it is a wonderful thing to tell
what noise and iangeling of tongues there is, after they begin all to bee
well whitled with wine. What shoulde I neede manye wordes?",1483-1600,39038
"Shortlie after, to wit on the one and twentith of Aprill, the
said archbishop sat at saint Magnus, vpon inquisition for the authors
of the said disorder, and found the fault to consist speciallie in the
lord Strange and his wife. So that vpon the first daie of Maie next
following in Paules church, before the said archbishop, the maior of
London, and others, the said offendors submitted themselues to doo
penance, and sware to doo it in such sort as to them it was inioined;
namelie, as followeth. That immediatlie all their seruants should (in
their shirts) go before the parson of saint Dunstans, from Paules to
the said saint Dunstans church; and the lord Strange bare headed, with
his ladie barefooted; Reignold Kenwood archdeacon of London following
them. Also it was appointed them, that at the consecrating or hallowing
of the said church (which they had prophaned) the ladie should fill all
the vessels with [1] water, and offer likewise to the altar an ornament
of ten pounds; and the lord hir husband a pix of siluer of fiue pounds. Which doone by waie of a satisfactorie expiation, it is likelie they
were absolued: but the lord Strange had first made the wife of the said
Petwarden slaine in the fraie, large amends: as Fabian saith, though in
what sort he maketh no mention.",1483-1600,46671
"5th. Up, and all the morning at the office, where we sat till noon, and
then I home to dinner, where Mary Batelier and her brother dined with us,
who grows troublesome in his talking so much of his going to Marseilles,
and what commissions he hath to execute as a factor, and a deal of do of
which I am weary. After dinner, with Sir W. Pen, my wife, and Mary
Batelier to the Duke of York's house, and there saw ""Heraclius,"" which is
a good play; but they did so spoil it with their laughing, and being all
of them out, and with the noise they made within the theatre, that I was
ashamed of it, and resolve not to come thither again a good while,
believing that this negligence, which I never observed before, proceeds
only from their want of company in the pit, that they have no care how
they act. My wife was ill, and so I was forced to go out of the house
with her to Lincoln's Inn walks, and there in a corner she did her
business, and was by and by well, and so into the house again, but sick of
their ill acting. So home and to the office, where busy late, then home
to supper and to bed.",1600-1700,4180

"When to him misfortune stray'd,
      No brothers gave relief;
   To assist the man each seem'd afraid,
      Or ease the brow of grief. A trifling pittance neighbours say,
      The elder B---r sent;
   Not half enough in life's decay,
      To pay his nurse and rent. From his misfortunes well its known,
      Their anger did increase;
   He wish'd his friend would make it known,
      He died with all at peace.",1700-1800,32276
"A common application of this principle
is seen in the choice of department heads,
foremen, and other bosses. Invariably these
win promotion by industry, skill, and efficiency
greater than that displayed by their fellows,
or by all-round mastery of their trades which
enable them to show their less efficient mates
how any and all operations should be conducted. This focusing of attention upon individuals
worthy of imitation has been carried much
farther by various companies. Through their
``house organs''--weekly or monthly papers
published primarily for circulation within the
organization--they make record of every
incident reflecting unusual skill, initiative, or
personal power in an individual member of
the organization. <p 36>

A big order closed, a difficult contract
secured, a complex or delicate operation performed
in less than the usual time, a new personal
record in production, the invention of
an unproved method or machine--whatever
the achievement, it is described and glorified,

CAPTAIN JOHN RACKHAM, AND HIS CREW


John Rackham was Quarter-Master to _Vane's_ Company, till _Vane_ was
turned out for not fighting the French Man-of-War, and _Rackham_ put
in Captain in his place, which happened about the 24th day of
_November_, 1718. His first cruise was among the _Caribbe_ Islands,
where he took and plundered several vessels. Afterwards, to the
windward of _Jamaica_, he fell in with a _Madeira_ Man, which he
detained till he had made his market out of her, and then restored her
to her Master, suffering _Hosea Tisdel_, a tavern-keeper at _Jamaica_,
whom he had taken among his Prizes, to go aboard her, she being bound
for that Island.",1700-1800,24439

not to be feared; but that they shall haue cause both to feare and loue

aprons of the same rounde about their middles; all els naked; of such as

hazle, & arrowes of reeds; flat edged truncheons also of wood about a
yard long, neither haue they any thing to defend themselues but targets
made of barcks; and some armours made of stickes wickered together with
thread. Their townes are but small, & neere the sea coast but few, some
cotaining but 10. or 12. houses: some 20. the greatest that we haue
seene haue bene but of 30. houses: if they be walled it is only done

"_Observations on the foregoing Account_. This Excellent Philosophical Account of Brewing _October_ Beer, has
hitherto remained in private Hands as a very great Secret, and was given
to a Friend of mine by the Author himself, to whom the World is much
obliged, altho' it comes by me; In justice therefore to this ingenious
Person, I would here mention his Name, had I leave for so doing; but at
present this Intimation must suffice. However, I shall here take notice,
that his Caution against using tailed or dusty Malt, which is too commonly
sold, is truly worthy of Observation; for these are so far from producing
more Ale or Beer, that they absorb and drink part of it up. In Grinding Malts he notifies well to prevent a foul Drink.",1700-1800,8900
"As she was doing so a boy in a ragged cap appeared
from somewhere, snatched an apple out of the basket and was about to
slip away when the old woman saw him and caught him by the sleeve. The
boy struggled to get away, but the old woman held him fast with both
hands. She had knocked off his cap and clutched him by the hair. The boy
screamed, the woman cursed.",1900-2000,51708
"SIR GAWAINE rode more than a pace, and Gaheris his brother that rode
with him instead of a squire to do him service. So as they rode they
saw two knights fight on horseback passing sore, so Sir Gawaine and his
brother rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought so. The one knight answered and said, We fight for a simple matter, for we
two be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman. Alas,
said Sir Gawaine, why do ye so?",1483-1600,1251
"The largest
vessel was the flagship of the Levant squadron, and was of 1,249 tons,
and carried 30 guns. The crew consisted of 80 sailors and 344 soldiers. The next largest was of 1,200 tons and carried 47 guns, but the greater
number of the vessels were much smaller. The popular belief as to their
incredible size and unwieldiness must therefore be dismissed as
baseless, for even the largest ships were far exceeded in size by some
of the carracks, or merchant vessels, of that day. On the average the
Spanish vessels mounted 22 guns apiece, and carried crews of 231 sailors
and soldiers.",1483-1600,33098

slander, how careful we should be to interpret fairly and favourably

representation of men's discourse, or their practice; suppressing 
some part of the truth in them, or concealing some circumstances 
about them which might serve to explain, to excuse, or to extenuate 
them. In such a manner easily, without uttering any logical 
untruth, one may yet grievously calumniate.",1700-1800,10274

"How long this
event had occurred before Nathaniel Woodes wrote his drama upon the
story, we have no means of knowing; but the object of the author
unquestionably was to forward and fix the Reformation, and we may
conclude, perhaps, that an incident of the kind would not be brought
upon the stage until some years after Elizabeth had been seated on the
throne, and until what was called ""the new faith"" was firmly settled in
the belief, and in the affections, of the great majority of the nation. We apprehend, therefore, that ""The Conflict of Conscience"" was not
written until about 1570. It is the introduction of this real person, under the covert name of
Philologus, that constitutes the chief distinction between the drama we
have reprinted and Moral-plays, which, though still sometimes exhibited,
were falling into desuetude. As most persons are aware, they consisted,
in their first and simplest form, entirely of allegorical or
representative characters, although, as audiences became accustomed to
such abstractions, attempts were from time to time made to give, even to
such imaginary impersonations, individual peculiarities and interests. Besides the hero of ""The Conflict of Conscience,"" his friends Eusebius
and Theologus may also have been intended for real personages; and
Gisbertus and Paphinitius were, possibly, the true names of the sons of
Francis Spiera.",1700-1800,9848

"The notion
generally received is, that the coral found in such quantities at the
bottom of the sea might communicate this colour to the water: an account
merely chimerical. Coral is not to be found in all parts of this gulf,
and red coral in very few. Nor does this water in fact differ from that
of other seas. The patriarch and I have frequently amused ourselves with
making observations, and could never discover any redness, but in the
shallows, where a kind of weed grew which they call gouesmon, which
redness disappeared as soon as we plucked up the plant.",1700-1800,1436
"of
leading the way to a knowledge of the laws of terrestrial magnetism! Such an unexpected extension of an apparently useless fact should
dispose us to entertain a kinder regard for the labours of one
another, and teach us to judge with diffidence of the abstract
results of science. A discovery which may appear incapable of
useful application to-day, may be our glory to-morrow,--it may even
change the face of empires, and wield the destiny of nations. The conic sections of Apollonius Pergaeus remained useless for two
thousand years: who could have supposed that, after the lapse of
twenty centuries, they would have formed the basis of astronomy?--a
science giving to navigation safety, guiding the pilot through
unknown seas, and tracing for him in the heavens an unerring path
to his native shores. Some apology may be necessary for this digression; but, I
confess, the subject has always appeared to me to be capable
of much interesting illustration, and I heartily concur in the
opinion expressed by the accomplished author of ""Lettres a
Sophie""--""_L'Histoire des grands effets par les petites causes

Sebastian, saying that they were his--five hundred pesos received from
a berth on ship, given him by his Lordship for Mexico, and which, with
his Lordship's permission, he sold when he remained; one hundred and
seventy pesos from a pay-warrant which his Lordship had ordered to be

"Secondly, such
a commonwealth must either be in peace, or war; if she be in peace,
the few are soonest effeminated and corrupted and so obnoxious also to
faction. If in war, succeeding ill, she is an easy prey; or succeeding
well, ruined by increase: a weight which her foundation is not able to
bear. For Lacedaemon, when she had made herself mistress upon the matter
of all Greece, through a slight accident, the rebellion of Thebes,
occasioned by the conspiracy of Pelopidas discovering this infirmity of
her nature, the rest of her conquered cities immediately fell off, and
in the turn as it were of a hand reduced her from the fullest tide to
the lowest ebb of her fortune. And Venice having possessed herself of a
great part of Italy by her purse, was no sooner in defence of it put to
the trial of arms than she lost all in one battle.",1600-1700,2801

"An examination of the amount of
alluvial matter deposited by rivers, of the progress of downs, and of
other changes on the surface of the earth, informs us clearly that the
present state of things did not commence at a very remote period. The history of nations confirms the testimony of the fossils and of the
rocks. The chronology of none of the nations of the West can be traced
unbroken farther back than 3,000 years. The Pentateuch, the most ancient
document the world possesses, and all subsequent writings allude to a
universal deluge, and the Pentateuch and Vedas and Chou-king date this
catastrophe as not more than 5,400 years before our time.",1900-2000,25509

exist. The most unbounded wealth is the neighbour of the most hideous
poverty; the most gorgeous pomp is placed in strong relief by the most
deplorable squalor; the most seducing luxury is only separated by a
narrow wall from the most appalling misery. The crumbs which fall from the tables of the rich would appear delicious
viands to starving millions; and yet those millions obtain them not! In that city there are in all districts five prominent buildings: the
church, in which the pious pray; the gin-palace, to which the wretched
poor resort to drown their sorrows; the pawnbroker's, where miserable
creatures pledge their raiment, and their children's raiment, even unto
the last rag, to obtain the means of purchasing food, and--alas!",1800-1900,47312

"When all our business was ended we departed, and took our way by the
Islands of Canaria, which are esteemed some 300 leagues from this part
of Spain; and falling purposely with Palma, with intention to have taken
our pleasure of that place, for the full digesting of many things into
order, and the better furnishing our store with such several good things
as it affordeth very abundantly, we were forced by the vile sea-gate,
which at that present fell out, and by the naughtiness of the
landing-place, being but one, and that under the favour of many
platforms well furnished with great ordnance, to depart with the receipt
of many of their cannon-shot, some into our ships and some besides,
some of them being in very deed full cannon high. But the only or chief
mischief was the dangerous sea-surge, which at shore all alongst plainly
threatened the overthrow of as many pinnaces and boats as for that time
should have attempted any landing at all. Now seeing the expectation of this attempt frustrated by the causes
aforesaid, we thought it meeter to fall with the Isle Ferro, to see if
we could find any better fortune; and coming to the island we landed a
thousand men in a valley under a high mountain, where we stayed some two
or three hours. In which time the inhabitants, accompanied with a young
fellow born in England, who dwelt there with them, came unto us, shewing
their state to be so poor that they were all ready to starve, which was
not untrue; and therefore without anything gotten, we were all commanded
presently to embark, so as that night we put off to sea south-south-east
along towards the coast of Barbary. Upon Saturday in the morning, being the 13th of November, we fell with
Cape Blank, which is a low land and shallow water, where we catched
store of fish; and doubling the cape, we put into the bay, where we
found certain French ships of war, whom we entertained with great
courtesy, and there left them.",1483-1600,3334

"But several circumstances
concurring to form the judgment we make on the magnitude of distant
objects, by means of which they appear far larger than others, whose
visible appearance hath an equal or even greater extension; it follows
that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which are
wont to attend the vision of distant objects, and so come to influence
the judgments made on their magnitude, they shall proportionably appear
less than otherwise they would. For any of those things that caused an
object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible extension
being either omitted or applied without the usual circumstances, the
judgment depends more entirely on the visible extension, and consequently
the object must be judged less. Thus in the present case the situation of
the thing seen being different from what it usually is in those objects
we have occasion to view, and whose magnitude we observe, it follows that
the very same object, being an hundred feet high, should seem less than
if it was an hundred feet off on (or nearly on) a level with the eye. What has been here set forth seems to me to have no small share in
contributing to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon, and
deserves not to be passed over in the explication of it. 74.",1700-1800,4722

were sent to the stake in the Middle Ages and that so many
inventors and innovators have died in despair even if they have
escaped martyrdom. It is in defence, too, of such beliefs that
the world has been so often the scene of the direst disorder, and
that so many millions of men have died on the battlefield, and
will yet die there. There are great difficulties in the way of establishing a general
belief, but when it is definitely implanted its power is for a

that came to execute the kings commandement (for the other rather
forsooke their prince and countrie, than they would consent to obeie

Hubert de Burgh did preserue him from that iniurie, not doubting
but rather to haue thanks than displeasure at the kings hands, for
deliuering him of such infamie as would haue redounded vnto his
highnesse, if the yoong gentleman had beene so cruellie dealt withall. For he considered, that king John had resolued vpon this point
onelie in his heat and furie (which moueth men to vndertake manie an
inconuenient enterprise, vnbeseeming the person of a common man, much
more reprochfull to a prince, all men in that mood being meere foolish

that Arthur also through sorrow and greefe was departed out of this

"LETTER the EIGHTH Miss LUTTERELL to Mrs MARLOWE Bristol April 4th

I feel myself greatly obliged to you my dear Emma for such a mark of
your affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you made
me of our Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great releif to
me to write to you and as long as my Health and Spirits will allow
me, you will find me a very constant correspondent; I will not say
an entertaining one, for you know my situation suffciently not to be
ignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and I know my own Heart too
well not to be sensible that it would be unnatural. You must not expect
news for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted, or in
whose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect scandal
for by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or
inventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy
effusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness
it once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness. The
Possibility of being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry
will be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I know refuse to read
what it will so much releive my Heart to write.",1700-1800,1212

"Mrs. Bargrave is the person to whom Mrs. Veal appeared after her
death; she is my intimate friend, and I can avouch for her reputation,
for these last fifteen or sixteen years, on my own knowledge; and I
can confirm the good character she had from her youth, to the time of
my acquaintance. Though, since this relation, she is calumniated by
some people, that are friends to the brother of this Mrs. Veal, who
appeared; who think the relation of this appearance to be a
reflection, and endeavour what they can to blast Mrs. Bargrave's
reputation, and to laugh the story out of countenance. But by the
circumstances thereof, and the cheerful disposition of Mrs. Bargrave,
notwithstanding the ill-usage of a very wicked husband, there is not
yet the least sign of dejection in her face; nor did I ever hear her
let fall a desponding or murmuring expression; nay, not when actually
under her husband's barbarity; which I have been witness to, and
several other persons of undoubted reputation. Now you must know, Mrs. Veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty
years of age, and for some years last past had been troubled with
fits; which were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her
discourse very abruptly to some impertinence.",1700-1800,36587

applications were in vain, I was set on shore under parole the fourth of
August, and the ship sailed with the other prisoners soon after. The cause of my detention, as I was afterwards told by Mr. Murray, was,
that Governor Hamilton, of Detroit, had wrote the General not to send
me round with the other prisoners; for if I got into the United States,
he knew I would come immediately upon him, and as I knew the country,
was well acquainted with the languages of the different Indians about
the lakes, and had great influence among them, should be the means of

When the Sick were attacked with a Shortness and Difficulty of
Breathing, which was not relieved by Evacuations, and the Use of
cooling Medicines, and Pectorals, and Blisters, nothing gave so much
Ease, or had such a good Effect, as a gentle Vomit; for it often
removed the immediate Oppression from the Breast, and helped to pump
up the Matter from the Lungs. In the advanced State of the Consumption, the Cough was always very
troublesome; and the Sick found no Relief but from Opiate Medicines,
which, in such Cases, cannot be expected to do more than give a little

generally mixed them with some _oxymel scilliticum_, or _tinctura

to go forthwith and assemble at his quarters, which was done. Thus all
the outposts were forgotten. At last the noise and bawling was so

            Have I not now a right to be proud? I’ve mastered the lordly forest-tree,
            I’m King of the woods, come see, come see. Night’s gems are beauteous, right rare are they,

"For example: in the exhortation to communicants, it was written in the
book of 1549, ‘He hath left _in_ these holy mysteries, as a pledge of His
love, and a continual remembrance of the same, _his own blessed body and
precious blood_ for us to feed upon spiritually to our endless comfort
and consolation.’  If the word ‘mysteries’ was understood of the
consecrated elements, this passage might have been understood as teaching
that the spiritual food was actually in the consecrated bread and wine. So in 1552, the passage was changed to the well-known words, ‘He hath
instituted and ordained holy mysteries as pledges of His love, and
continual remembrance of His death, to our great and endless comfort,’
and all possibility of misapprehension was removed. Again, in the prayer of consecration in 1549 we find the words, ‘Hear us,
O Merciful Father, we beseech thee; and with Thy Holy Spirit and Word
vouchsafe to bless and sanctify these Thy gifts and creatures of bread
and wine, that they may be unto us the body and blood of Thy most dearly
beloved Son Jesus Christ.’  These words might fairly be taken as praying
for a change in the elements, and therefore in the next version the
passage was completely changed, and the unmistakable language of our
present Prayer Book introduced in its stead: ‘Grant that we receiving
these Thy creatures of bread and wine, according to Thy Son our Saviour
Jesus Christ’s holy institution, in remembrance of His death and passion,
may be partakers of His most blessed body and blood.’

So in the prayer before consecration. In the first book the words were,
‘Grant us, therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of Thy dear Son
Jesus Christ, and to drink His blood _in these Holy Mysteries_.’  But
this was liable to the same danger as the passage in the exhortation
already referred to, and therefore the words, ‘In these holy mysteries,’
were struck out, and the prayer left as it now stands in our Prayer Book. And so once more, in the words of administration in the first book there
was only the first portion of the present sentences.",1800-1900,52440

"Their chief remedy was to commit themselves to God, and to
beseech him that he would direct them the way that they might save their

came peaceably, and told them, that two days' journey from thence, near
unto the Great River, were two towns, whereof the Christians had no
notice, and that the province was called _Minoya_, and was a fruitful
soil: that, whether at this present there was any maize or no, they knew
not, because they had war with them: but that they would be very glad
with the favor of the Christians to go and spoil them. The Governor sent
a captain thither with horsemen and footmen, and the Indians of _Nilco_
with him. He came to _Minoya_, and found two great towns seated in a
plain and open soil, half a league distant, one in sight of another, and
in them he took many Indians, and found great store of maize. Presently

the stalks. ""This is termed succouring or suckering the tobacco,"" and

"Whereas ’tis certain, that if the Mother’s Pains, _strongly bearing
down_, the Muscles of the Belly contracting and becoming sensibly
_hard_ to the _Touch_, don’t manifestly promote the Birth, it must
needs be owing to some Obstruction beyond the Midwife’s Skill;
who in this Circumstance is apt to complain, the Pains are not
sufficiently _strong_, ’till the poor Woman is ready to expire,
from the Loss of her Strength, by her long Suffering under them;
and told she must patiently wait God’s Time, who in Case he
miraculously interpos’d, wants not the Midwife’s Assistance: And
what still adds to this deplorable Calamity, ’tis likely she is
put upon exerting her utmost Strength, assisted by Cordials; when
_encouraging_ her _Labour_ and _provoking_ her _Pains_, ’till the
Obstructions in the Way of the _Birth_ are remov’d, contribute
still further to the Danger attending. I don’t deny but that in some Cases, a _tedious_ Labour may be
owing to a Defect of _sufficiently_ strong Pains; but as this
often proceeds from _Circumstances_ obstructing the _Birth_,
true Labour naturally takes Place, when they are remov’d; and, by
a right Management of the Hand, is more _effectually_ promoted,
without Cordials or _forcing_ Medicines, where the Pains are
deficient. Under this Sort of unnatural Birth, may very well be enumerated,
the _Face_ presenting _towards_ the Mother’s Belly, or the _Side_
of the Head coming _Foremost_, for its Passage must be extreamly
difficult in these Postures; as well as when the _Face_ comes

a bending attitude, with an expression of surprise, forms a curved outline
opposed to the arch of the ceiling, a figure greatly celebrated, no less on
account of the perspective than the design. It is truly surprising how a

the after adoption of their children’s example, had raised themselves to
a comparative appreciation of the privileges bestowed for the elevation
of humanity above the coarser instincts of its sub-alliance with the
lower orders of animality. The next train, in the knightly roachalvacade, embraced in the retinues
of its leaders the representative extremes of humanity in the British
Isles. They had bluff apetital features, with but a slight remnant
predisposition to the philosophical swinishness that enveloped with
fatty folds the direct descendants of their Saxo-German antecedents. In

house: wherefore the blanks in the side urns are by so many the
fewer. And so much for the lot, which is of the greater art but less
consequence, because it concerns proposition only: but all (except the
tribunes and the judges, which being but assistants have no suffrage)
are to ballot at the result, to which I now come. The four orders of electors having perfected their lists, the face of
the house is changed: for the urns are taken away, and every senator
and magistrate is seated in his proper place, saving the electors, who,
having given their suffrages already, may not stir out of their
chambers till the house have given theirs, and the rest of the ballot be
performed; which follows in this manner:

The four lists being presented by the secretaries of each council of
electors to the signory, are first read, according to their order, to
the house, with an audible voice; and then the competitors are put to
the ballot or suffrage of the whole Senate in this manner: A, A named
to be strategus in the first order, whereupon eight ballotins, or pages,
such as are expressed by the figures f, f, take eight of the boxes
represented, though rudely, by the figures g, g, and go four on the one
and four on the other side of the house, that is, one to every bench,
signifying ""A, A named to be the strategus in the first order.."" and
every magistrate or senator (beginning by the strategus and the orator

"The problem which the archduke had set himself to solve was not an easy
one. He was to reduce a town, which he could invest and had already
succeeded very thoroughly in investing on the land aide, but which was
open to the whole world by sea; while the besieged on their part could
not only rely upon their own Government and people, who were more at home
on the ocean than was any nation in the world, but upon their alliance
with England, a State hardly inferior in maritime resources to the
republic itself. On the western side, which was the weakest, his progress was from the
beginning the more encouraging, and his batteries were soon able to make
some impression upon the outer works, and even to do considerable damage
to the interior of the town. In the course of a few months he had fifty
siege-guns in position, and had constructed a practicable road all around
the place, connecting his own fortifications on the west and south with
those of Bucquoy on the east. Albert's leading thought however was to cut off the supplies.",1483-1600,4884

"MANA. The chief of any family who discovered and took possession of any
unoccupied land obtained what was called the _mana_ of the land. This
word _mana_, in its ordinary use, signifies power, but in its
application to land corresponds somewhat with the power of a Trustee. Thus _mana_ gave a power to appropriate the land among his own tribe
according to a well recognized rule which was considered _tika_ or
straight. Such appropriation, however, once made, remained in force, and
gave a good title to the children and descendants of the person to whom
it had been thus appropriated.",1800-1900,42218

rays, will enter and pass out of such a plate, if that plate be of
some certain thicknesses; but if it be of other thicknesses, it will
not break through it, but be reflected back: in which is seen, that

"There was plenty of time for this, as their sleeper being on the
third and last section of the circus train, they would not leave
for nearly two hours yet, at the earliest. The baths of the Circus Boys were more severe than pleasant, and
in taking them each one had to perform a service for the other. The bath consisted of the performer's standing still while his
companion emptied several buckets of cold water over him,
following it with a liberal smearing of soap and then some more
pailfuls of water. Once a week, over Sunday, the performers were allowed to sleep
at hotels, providing the circus did not have an all day run.",1900-2000,2476

"It rained almost without stopping. At times it poured, which really
does not happen often in much-abused London; but even heavy rain
is not so depressing in spring as it is in winter, and when the
Primadonna raised her eyes from her book and looked out of the big
window, she was not thinking of the dreariness outside but of what
she should wear in the evening. To tell the truth, she did not often
trouble herself much about that matter when she was not going to sing,
and all singers and actresses who habitually play 'costume parts' are
conscious of looking upon stage-dressing and ordinary dressing from
totally different points of view. By far the larger number of them
have their stage clothes made by a theatrical tailor, and only an
occasional eccentric celebrity goes to Worth or Doucet to be dressed
for a 'Juliet,' a 'Tosca,' or a 'Dona Sol.' Margaret looked at the rain and decided that Logotheti should not find
her in a tea-gown, not because it would look too intimate, but because
tea-gowns suggest weariness, the state of being misunderstood, and a
craving for sympathy.",1900-2000,10521
"The
derivation of the nervous system from the epiblast has since been made out
for a sufficient number of forms satisfactorily to establish the
generalization that it is all but universally derived from the epiblast. In any animal in which there is no distinct nervous system, it is obvious
that the general surface of the body must be sensitive to the action of its
surroundings, or to what are technically called stimuli. We know
experimentally that this is so in the case of the Protozoa, and of some
very simple Metazoa, such as the freshwater Polype or Hydra, where there is
no distinct nervous system.",1800-1900,41357
"The brutes, which
have only their bodies to conserve, are continually occupied in
seeking sources of nourishment; but men, of whom the chief part is
the mind, ought to make the search after wisdom their principal
care, for wisdom is the true nourishment of the mind; and I feel
assured, moreover, that there are very many who would not fail in
the search, if they would but hope for success in it, and knew the
degree of their capabilities for it. There is no mind, how ignoble
soever it be, which remains so firmly bound up in the objects of the
senses, as not sometime or other to turn itself away from them in
the aspiration after some higher good, although not knowing
frequently wherein that good consists. The greatest favourites of
fortune--those who have health, honours, and riches in abundance--
are not more exempt from aspirations of this nature than others;
nay, I am persuaded that these are the persons who sigh the most
deeply after another good greater and more perfect still than any
they already possess. But the supreme good, considered by natural
reason without the light of faith, is nothing more than the
knowledge of truth through its first causes, in other words, the
wisdom of which philosophy is the study. And, as all these
particulars are indisputably true, all that is required to gain
assent to their truth is that they be well stated.",1600-1700,4391

"An _English_ Colonel guarded a Pass towards the aforesaid little Town,
to which the Enemy bent their Course; and being in Distress, was
reliev'd by my Lord in Person, who ordred his Retreat to such an
Advantage, that he flank'd the Enemy with perpetual Fire; and this was
the first Cause that cool'd them in their Design of pushing our Army. At his return, the Prince receiv'd him with a great deal of
Satisfaction, and assured him that he would let the King know that he
saw into the Art of a General more in one Day, than others do in a
great many Years. At the end of this Campaign, my Lord _Marlborough_ was ordered, with
half of the Forces under his Command, to Embark for _Ireland_; where I
come to relate what he performed there: As soon as he arrived in the
Harbour of _Kingsale_, having Landed his Forces, without the least loss
of Time, Marched directly to the Fort or Citadel of that Place, which
is a strong Fortification, and at that time, well provided with a good
Garrison, and all things necessary for a strong Defence. My Lord did not stand to use Forms with them, which might look like a
Siege; but with a conquering Resolution, and perpetual Volleys, so
terrified them, that they soon Surrendred. And now at this Place it was where the Duke's Actions began to be
Envied, and evil Reports touching his good Name and Reputation were
industriously spread abroad; and I am apt to believe, such back Friends
as these will hardly leave him so long as he remains in the World.",1700-1800,37505

"In August their holes begin to be

then seen lying at the mouths of their holes.) Not many summers ago I endeavoured to transplant a colony to the
terrace in my garden, by boring deep holes in the sloping turf. The
new inhabitants stayed some time, and fed and sung; but wandered
away by degrees, and were heard at a farther distance every
morning; so that it appears that on this emergency they made use of
their wings in attempting to return to the spot from which they
were taken. One of these crickets, when confined in a paper cage and set in the
sun, and supplied with plants moistened with water, will feed and
thrive, and become so merry and loud as to be irksome in the same

"Roque passed his nights in some place or other apart from his
men, that they might not know where he was, for the many proclamations
the viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and
uneasiness, and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his
own men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth,
a weary miserable life! At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, and
secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six squires,
set out for Barcelona. They reached the strand on Saint John's Eve during
the night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to whom he
presented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until then given),
left them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.",1600-1700,5940
"Yet whole neighborhoods of settlers to this day have no other

antelope meat, hot biscuits, and coffee, we both return with pick and
shovel, and, carefully saving each weathered fragment, trace the remains
to where the rest of the bones lie _in situ_, as the scientists
say,—that is, in their original position in their rocky sepulcher. Then comes the work in the hot sun, whose rays are reflected with added
fervor from the glaring surface of the chalk. Every blow of the pick

Dietrich had already had the pleasure of welcoming Frau Schumann and
Joachim to Oldenburg during this his first season of activity there, and
had worked well to prepare the way for Brahms, so that the evening of
March 14, the date fixed for the composer's personal introduction to the
concert-going public, was awaited with keen interest. Arriving at
Dietrich's house a few days previously, Brahms found himself surrounded
by new friends, and had won the favour of the musical elite of the town
before his public appearance, by playing several of his works in private
circles. The members of the orchestra, who assembled _en masse_ on the

their love. For there is this difference between divine and human love,
that the latter supposes a previous acquaintance with its object,

one is not very difficult to be solved, though it is distinguished for

census in this country was not until more than a hundred years after Sir

it could be established, and what useful information it would give. There was a census taken at Rome 566 years before Christ. But the first
census in Great Britain was taken in 1801, under provision of an Act
passed on the last day of the year 1800, to secure a numbering of the
population every ten years. Ireland was not included in the return; the
first census in Ireland was not until the year 1813. Sir William Petty had to base his calculations partly upon the Bills of
Mortality, which had been imperfectly begun under Elizabeth, but fell
into disuse, and were revived, as a weekly record of the number of
deaths, beginning on the 29th of October, 1603; notices of diseases first

would proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more

"THAT the Truth therefore may at once be brought into an open Light, and
the Pestilence appear in its genuine Affections, I think it proper to
premise this one Thing, because the whole depends upon it, _viz._ That the
Pestilence is the most notorious of all popular Diseases, and depends upon
some Cause equally common, and in every respect adequate to its extensive
Effects; which being granted, it naturally follows, that all particular
Causes which may accidentally intervene, (the Recital of which would be
very tedious) are resolvable into this one. AND for what concerns that Pestilence now under Enquiry, this we have as
to its Origin, from the most irrefragable Authority, that it first came
into this Island by Contagion, and was imported to us from _Holland_, in
Packs of Merchandice; and if any one pleases to trace it further, he may
be satisfied by common Fame, it came thither from _Turkey_ in Bails of
Cotton or Silk, which is a strange Preserver of the pestilential Steams. For that Part of the World is seldom free from such Infections, altho' it
is sometimes more severe than others, according to the Disposition of
Seasons and Temperature of Air in those Regions: But if any would yet more
intimately be acquainted with its Origin, it concerns him to know all the
Changes the Air in these Climates is subject to, and its various
Properties of Dryness, Moisture, Heat, Cold, _&c._

BUT least I should be thought too prolix in the Enumeration of such
Circumstances, and incur the Suspicion of Atheism, (a Charge too just upon
the Faculty) by ascribing too much to second Causes, as the Schools please
to call them, it may be convenient for me to declare, that the [Greek: to
theion] of a Pestilence is as much a Part of my Faith, as any others; the
sacred Pages clearly and demonstratively prove, that the Almighty, by his
Authority, and at his Pleasure, may draw the Sword, bend the Bow, or shoot
the Arrows of Death; and a Retrospection into Times past, shews many
convincing Proofs of this terrible Truth; and in this Contagion before us,
the Footsteps of an over-ruling Power are very legible, especially so far
as concerns his divine Permission: But the great God's Purposes are
Secrets too awful for Mortals to pry into, although we know that he
punishes as a Parent, and chides for our Good, which makes it our Duty to
kiss the Rod, and submit. But enough of this, least I should be thought to
invade anothers Province; and it is sufficient to the Purpose of a
Physician, to assign natural and obvious Causes; and where such are
discoverable, it is unworthy of him and the divine Art he professes, as
well as an Affront to good Sense, to have Recourse to any other.",1700-1800,40106

"Now that there is a prohibition of Exportation
of our Fullers Earth, to Forreign parts, is well enough known to the
Officers of the Customehouse, but it is not looked after as it should
be, for either some of them are negligent, not regarding their duties,
and behaving themselves with that vigilance and circumspection, as
such places of Trust do necessarily call for at their hands; or else
they wink at such miscarriages, and suffer our Fullers Earth to be
carried away, as the like is commonly done concerning our Wooll. [Sidenote: _Wooll carryed to +France+, &c._]

And although most part of our Lawes are binding enough with severe
Penalties annexed to them, if they were but duly observed and well
put into Execution, yet not one of ten thousand doth know the Lawes
of Prohibition throughout the Kingdom, and how to put them into
Execution; and although many people do certainly know that Fullers
Earth is certainly carried out of the River of _Medway_, (alias
_Chatham_,) and our Wooll commonly shipped off from _Dover-Cliffs_ by
night, from _Rumney-Marsh_, the Isle of _Wight_, _Purbeck_, and about
_Waymouth_, and in several other parts of _England_; and too much from
_Southhamton_: under the pretence of an Allowance by the Law, for
the supply of Jarsey; Yet no body doth, or dareth to prosecute the
Offenders for the breach of our good and wholesome Laws, because the
very principles of Nature in every man, teach himself Preservation, and
he that minds but that, is afraid to meddle with these offenders who
are commonly Rich men, and strengthened both with Money and Friends in
the Counties where they dwell; so that every man that is willing to
preserve himself, his Estate and Family, is afraid of appearing against
these Transgressors in the behalf of the _King_, though it be never so
much conducible to the good and welfare of the whole Kingdom; for fear
they should be dealt withal as I have been. [Sidenote: _Tradesmen undone._]

And while I am speaking about the negligence and unfaithfulness of
the Officers of the Customs; give me leave in two or three words
for a Digression concerning the importation of Forrein prohibited
Commodities, to the utter ruine of many poor Tradesmen, with their
Families in this our Kingdom; as Ribbon Weavers, and Silk weavers, and
other such like Artificers in & about _London_, and several other parts
of the Kingdom, that they are so miserably Impoverished that they are
ready to perish, for want of necessary food, to keep life and soul
together; (as our English Proverb is) notwithstanding the great plenty
of all sorts of Provision in the Nation, (through the goodness and
bounty of God to us.) [Sidenote: _Smugglers prosecute honest men._]

[Sidenote: _That discover them._]

But all these errours, and miscarriages, might and may easily be
prevented, by the care and vigilancy of the Custome Officers,
especially in the out-Ports: But some Officers finding a perticular,
and present profit, by being invested with a Golden Livery, do rather
choose that, than to do their King and Countrey faithful service,
although it be also running the hazard of losing their present
Imployment, and future Preferment; for things of this Nature, are now
grown to that height of perfidiousness, and confidence, (I might say
Impudence) that two or three golden Decoys are sufficient to intrap
an inclining Surveyor, and if there should chance to be a discovery,
or a surprisal, there shall be all present help at hand, if need
require, for the carrying off the matter smoothly, and Witnesses in
any case shall not be wanting, to counterfeit Truth and Justice, when
it is directly contrary; by which malicious, and unnatural courses,
those that would be just and honest in their places and Offices,
are disheartned, through the leud and deceitful practices, of these
Catterpillars; who by such indirect Courses are disobedient to the
Lawes, and the Smugglers that imploy them, do multiply great troubles,
upon such as at any time discover these Offenders, yea and do violently
prosecute them at the Law, to make them Examples and terrors to others,
that so they might drive on their cheating trade without controul; and
yet such honest well-minded men do nothing but their duty, but for
that they have this _odium_ cast upon them, they are called Informing
Knaves, &c. notwithstanding the welfare of the whole Kingdome, doth in
a great measure depend upon the discovery of such abuses. [Sidenote: _Smugglers are befriended_]

How much necessary may it then be supposed that there should be very
good incouragement given to such honest publique spirited men, as
should diligently enquire after such sinister practices: and as it
was before touched, those Smuglers are not only well acquainted with
some Attorneys and Clerks, who will either use undue practices, or make
delaies; but they make good interest with the Under-Sheriffs, in the
Countyes where they drive their Trade; and then these Undersheriffs
also have strange tricks and delays in their returns, in which some of
them will take part with the Offenders, instead of executing the Law
against them, so that such Offenders are incouraged; and by this means
it is, that our Wooll and Fullers Earth, and other prohibited Goods,
are exported so frequently out of the Kingdom, and Forrein prohibited
Goods, and Merchandize imported; so that our Manufacture is in a great
measure gone to decay: other Countries are greatly enriched, who also
live at a lower rate, and work cheaper than our People in _England_,
whereby our Trade is much taken off in Forrein parts, and our poor live
idle, with the other inconveniences consequent thereto, as hath been
already spoken to.",1600-1700,47509

"Figure is a Cause _Secundum quid_ of not
sinking: but, now, if it be doubted, for what Cause a thin Plate of
Lead goes not to the bottom; it shall be answered, that that proceeds
from its Figure: a discourse which would be indecent in a Child, much
more in _Aristotle_; For where is the occasion of doubting? And who
sees not, that if _Aristotle_ had held, that Figure was in some sort a
Cause of Natation, he would without the least Hesitation have writ;
That Figure is in a certain sort the Cause of Natation, and therefore
the Plate of Lead in respect of its large and expatiated Figure swims;
but if we take the proposition of _Aristotle_ as I say, and as it is
written, and as indeed it is true, the ensuing words come in very
oppositely, as well in the introduction of swift and slow, as in the
question, which very pertinently offers it self, and would say thus
much. Figures are not the Cause of moving or not moving simply upwards or
downwards, but of moving more quickly or slowly: But if it be so, the
Cause is doubtfull, whence it proceeds, that a Plate of Lead or of
Iron broad and thin doth swim, &c. And the occasion of the doubt is
obvious, because it seems at the first glance, that the Figure is the
Cause of this Natation, since the same Lead, or a less quantity, but
in another Figure, goes to the bottom, and we have already affirmed,
that the Figure hath no share in this effect. Lastly, if the intent of _Aristotle_ in this place had been to say,
that Figures, although not absolutely, are at least in some measure
the Cause of moving or not moving: I would have it considered, that he
names no less the Motion upwards, than the other downwards: and
because in exemplifying it afterwards, he produceth no other
Experiments than of a Plate of Lead, and Board of Ebony, Matters that
of their own Nature go to the bottom, but by vertue (as our
Adversaries say) of their Figure, rest afloat; it is fit that they
should produce some other Experiment of those Matters, which by their
Nature swims, but retained by their Figure rest at the bottom. But
since this is impossible to be done, we conclude, that _Aristotle_ in
this place, hath not attributed any action to the Figure of simply
moving or not moving.",1600-1700,37729

Atabalipa to be weighed after he had taken it, which Lopez setteth down
in these words following:--""Hallaron cincuenta y dos mil marcos de buena
plata, y un millon y trecientos y veinte y seis mil y quinientos
pesos de oro."" Which is, ""They found 52,000 marks of good silver, and
1,326,500 pesos of gold."" Now, although these reports may seem strange,
yet if we consider the many millions which are daily brought out of
Peru into Spain, we may easily believe the same. For we find that by the
abundant treasure of that country the Spanish king vexes all the princes
of Europe, and is become, in a few years, from a poor king of Castile,
the greatest monarch of this part of the world, and likely every day to
increase if other princes forslow the good occasions offered, and suffer
him to add this empire to the rest, which by far exceedeth all the rest.",1483-1600,2272

settling the remainder of the money which was due Stanton for me, it
was agreed that I should live with Col. Smith. This was the third

"Meanwhile, the king, who had, for
months, been lying in the southern portion of the realm, in Essex,
Kent, or Sussex, awaiting, at the head of the best warriors of his
kingdom, the arrival of his most inveterate foeman--summoned by news
of this irruption, unexpected, yet, as it seemed most formidable, into
his northern provinces, lulled into temporary carelessness by the
long tarrying of his Norman enemy; and hoping, as it indeed seemed
probable, that the prevailing wind would not change so abruptly,
but that he might, by using some extraordinary diligence and speed,
attack and overpower the besieging force at York, and yet return to
Dover in time to oppose, with the united force of his whole nation,
the disembarkation of the duke--had left his post and travelled with
all speed toward York, leading the bravest and best-disciplined of
his army against the fierce Norwegians, while the shores of Sussex
remained comparatively naked and defenceless. A bloody and decisive
battle fought at the bridge of Staneford, over the river Derwent,
rewarded his activity and valor--a battle in which he displayed no
less his generalship and valor, than the kind generosity and mercy
of his nature. Riding, himself, in person, up to the hostile lines,
before the first encounter, sheathed in the complete armor of the
Norman chivalry--which, since his visit to the continent, he had
adopted--“Where,” he cried, in his loudest tones, “is Tosti, son of
Godwin?”

“Here stands he,” answered the rebel, from the centre of the Norwegian
phalanx, which, with lowered spears, awaited the attack. “Thy brother,” replied Harold, concealed by the frontlet of his barred
helmet from all recognition, “sends thee his greeting--offers thee
peace, and friendship, and all thine ancient honors.”

the producing limits of the territory greatly extended, until now the
annual crude oil production is upwards of 1,000,000 tons. The fields
of Persia are very prolific, and their control to-day is in the hands
of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., an influential concern largely
controlled by the British Government, by reason of the investment of
large sums of public moneys a few years ago. The development of the
Persian fields is more or less in its initial stages, and though huge
quantities of oil have already been produced therefrom, the limits of
the presumably oil-bearing areas have by no means been defined. In
order to facilitate the export of Persian oil, a pipe-line has been

has already been laid down under which large quantities of Persian
petroleum products will come upon the English markets.",1700-1800,52825

did govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first
whereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so
that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise in the
account of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my

circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do

offence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt
not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an
_innuendo_ (as I think you call it). But, pray how could that which I

a Loss for modern Examples; but antient Story abounds with them. Miss[50] _Phoebe_ and her Sister were both ravished, and both were
well pleased with the Men who ravished them. Though the Story of _Deidamia_ was formerly in all the _Trojan_

ambitious minister, who knew how to make the august name of sovereign

taken, was to remove this artful favourite from the post he held in the
palace, and they were well aware it would be no easy task to make him
resign the government of the kingdom. For this purpose, they secretly
tampered with one of his most intimate friends, whom they engaged to
represent to him, that don Pedro attributed the ill treatment he

soldiers any further into the land than to Carapana, which he called
the port of Guiana; but from thence by the help of Carapana he had trade
further into the country, and always appointed ten Spaniards to reside
in Carapana's town (the Spanish settlement of Santo Tome de la Guyana,
founded by Berrio in 1591 or 1592, but represented by Raleigh as an
Indian pueblo), by whose favour, and by being conducted by his people,
those ten searched the country thereabouts, as well for mines as for
other trades and commodities. They also have gotten a nephew of Morequito, whom they have christened
and named Don Juan, of whom they have great hope, endeavouring by all
means to establish him in the said province. Among many other trades,
those Spaniards used canoas to pass to the rivers of Barema, Pawroma,
and Dissequebe (Essequibo), which are on the south side of the mouth of
Orenoque, and there buy women and children from the cannibals, which are
of that barbarous nature, as they will for three or four hatchets
sell the sons and daughters of their own brethren and sisters, and for
somewhat more even their own daughters. Hereof the Spaniards make great
profit; for buying a maid of twelve or thirteen years for three or four
hatchets, they sell them again at Margarita in the West Indies for fifty
and an hundred pesos, which is so many crowns. The master of my ship, John Douglas, took one of the canoas which came
laden from thence with people to be sold, and the most of them escaped;
yet of those he brought, there was one as well favoured and as well
shaped as ever I saw any in England; and afterwards I saw many of them,

soul desire honors when these are due to their station or when there is

seek to be honored beyond their deserts (e.g., when an ignorant man

temporary elective offices, a rich man or athletic hero expects that he
will be revered above those who are eminent for virtue or learning), or

know that a man of an ill complexion, hauing some contagious disease,

company: but contrariwise, men of a good and healthie complexion,

it is by meanes of the spirits and vertues which proceede from them,

if the soule be corrupted with many grosse sins, beeing coupled with
a diseased body of an euill complexion: and in like case is it, if
there be a feruent appetite, and vehement desire to hurt and mischiefe. For then the nature of the complexion and soundnesse woorketh more
forcibly by the cogitations of the soule, and longing desires that
it hath. For which cause the Leper that earnestly wisheth, and with
exceeding carefulnesse intendeth to infect some body that standeth
before him, doth both more speedily and dangerously infect him, then
he could haue done if he had not before hand thought hereof, desired
and purposed in. For Nature (as _Auicen_ teacheth, in the foresayde

"These centinels had orders to call aloud
to each other, _all is well_, every five minutes throughout the night; by
which means, almost as soon as the last centinel had answered, it was
time for the first to begin again, and there was a perpetual round of,
_all is well_. This circumstance almost totally depriving the Admiral of
sleep, because the centinels were mostly close to him where he lay, made
him frequently say, ""_I did hope for leave to sleep, and apprehend I might
be sufficiently guarded and taken care of, without so frequent a
repetition of this noisy ceremony close to my ear_."" At length the lieutenants of the ship had orders to watch in the great
cabbin, relieving each other every four hours, as is customary at sea: so
that there was always one of them in the cabbin with him day and night,
who delivered up the charge of the Admiral's person to the next officer,
keeping a journal, in which was minuted down every person's name who came
to him, the time when he came, and the time of his going away; and the
order to the centinels for calling out every five minutes, was then
omitted. When captain _Montague_ waited upon him, to inform him that the warrant
from the Admiralty was come, for putting the sentence passed upon him in
execution, he received the news with the same cool composure, that he had
received the sentence; without discovering the smallest emotion,
depression of spirits, or alteration in his behaviour. The same gentleman waited upon him again, on the 27th of _February_, being

Admiral _Boscawen_'s name, acquainted him that a respite was arrived for

"I could not then avoid this reflection--that,
if the deaths of these people in a war undertaken absolutely for their
protection could give me such concern, what horror must I have felt if,
like princes greedy of dominion, I had sacrificed such numbers to my own
pride, vanity, and ridiculous lust of power. ""After having vented my sorrows for some time in this manner, I began
to consider by what means I might possibly endeavor to retrieve this
misfortune; when, reflecting on the great number of priests I had in
my army, and on the prodigious force of superstition, a thought luckily
suggested itself to me, to counterfeit that St. James had appeared to me
in a vision, and had promised me the victory. While I was ruminating on
this the bishop of Najara came opportunely to me. As I did not intend
to communicate the secret to him, I took another method, and, instead
of answering anything the bishop said to me, I pretended to talk to St.
James, as if he had been really present; till at length, after having
spoke those things which I thought sufficient, and thanked the saint
aloud for his promise of the victory, I turned about to the bishop, and,
embracing him with a pleased countenance, protested I did not know he
was present; and then, informing him of this supposed vision, I asked
him if he had not himself seen the saint? He answered me he had; and
afterwards proceeded to assure me that this appearance of St. James was
entirely owing to his prayers; for that he was his tutelar saint.",1700-1800,1147
"In his preface to one of his plays he
observes, that this Tragi-comedy is one preserved amongst two hundred
and twenty, ""in which I have had either an entire hand, or at least a
main finger."" Of this prodigious number, Winstanley, Langbaine, and
Jacob agree, that twenty-four only remain; the reason Heywood himself
gives is this; ""That many of them by shifting and change of companies
have been negligently lost; others of them are still retained in the
hands of some actors, who think it against their profit to have them
come in print, and a third, that it was never any great ambition in me
to be voluminously read."" These seem to be more plausible reasons than
Winstanley gives for their miscarriage; ""It is said that he not only
acted himself every day, but also wrote each day a sheet; and that he
might lose no time, many of his plays were composed in the tavern, on
the backside of tavern bills, which may be the occasion that so many
of them are lost.""",1700-1800,10598
"So, till by wrong or negligence effaced,
The living index which thy Maker traced
Repeats the line each starry Virtue draws
Through the wide circuit of creation's laws;
Still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray
Where the dark shadows of temptation stray,
But, once defaced, forgets the orbs of light,
And leaves thee wandering o'er the expanse of night. ""What is thy creed?"" a hundred lips inquire;
""Thou seekest God beneath what Christian spire?"" Nor ask they idly, for uncounted lies
Float upward on the smoke of sacrifice;

to close in on their rear. It was probably the main fighting division left

"Religions that arise in ages totally ignorant and barbarous,
consist mostly of traditional tales and fictions, which may be different
in every sect, without being contrary to each other; and even when they
are contrary, every one adheres to the tradition of his own sect,
without much reasoning or disputation. But as philosophy was widely
spread over the world at the time when Christianity arose, the teachers
of the new sect were obliged to form a system of speculative opinions,
to divide, with some accuracy, their articles of faith, and to explain,
comment, confute, and defend, with all the subtlety of argument and
science. Hence naturally arose keenness in dispute, when the Christian
religion came to be split into new divisions and heresies: and this
keenness assisted the priests in the policy of begetting a mutual hatred
and antipathy among their deluded followers.",1700-1800,36120

March-December 1893 in this study, working in the Andaman Islands,
the Mergui Islands in the Bay of Bengal, and the Malay Peninsula,

"The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with
surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to
follow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress suggested; and so,
finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a
sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock
that lay there; which they did, observing closely what the youth was
about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to
his body with a white cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of
brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera; and he had the gaiters
turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of
pure alabaster. As soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a
towel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised his
face, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a
beauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:

""As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being."" The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side to
side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of
the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a
peasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of
them had ever beheld, or even Cardenio's if they had not seen and known
Luscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda
could compare with this.",1600-1700,5912

gladly--I might so easily have prefigured one's delight in his absence;

of the degree in which his great imaging, his great reminding and
enhancing function is rooted in the European basis. I felt his
non-existence on the American positively produce a void which nothing
else, as a vivifying substitute, hurried forward to fill; this being
indeed the case with many of the other voids, the most aching, which
left the habituated eye to cast about as for something to nibble in a
state of dearth. We never know, I think, how much these wanting elements
have to suggest to the pampered mind till we feel it living in view of
the community from which they have been simplified away. On these
occasions they conspire with the effect of certain other, certain
similar expressions, examples of social life proceeding as by the
serene, the possibly too serene, process of mere ignorance, to bring to
a head for the fond observer the wonder of what is supposed to strike,
for the projection of a finished world, the note that they are not there
to strike. However, as I quite grant the hypothesis of an observer still
fond and yet remarking the lapse of the purple patch of militarism but
with a joy unclouded, I limit myself to the merely personal point that
the fancy of a particular brooding analyst _could_ so sharply suffer

scarcely noticed the difference. During his academic years he created a sensation by declining to join the
Hasty Pudding Club. This was looked upon as a piece of inordinate self-

"Breakfast was brought in at last--bread and beefsteak on tin plates, and black coffee in tin cups, and no grabbing allowed. And after several dreary hours of waiting, after this, we were all marched out into the dungeon and joined there by all manner of vagrants and vagabonds, of all shades and colours and nationalities, from the other cells and cages of the place; and pretty soon our whole menagerie was marched up-stairs and locked fast behind a high railing in a dirty room with a dirty audience in it. And this audience stared at us, and at a man seated on high behind what they call a pulpit in this country, and at some clerks and other officials seated below him--and waited. This was the police court.",1800-1900,3191
"One of the wise men had
foretold some days before that a herd of wild buffaloes, sent by their
god, Anadongu, would speedily appear, and rescue the tribe from the
horrors of impending starvation. The prediction was possibly based upon
some optical delusion, like that I have mentioned. Whatever its origin,
the accomplishment was hailed with ecstasy; and I myself, a poor, almost
dying creature, stained with blood, crushed and speechless, was regarded
as their deliverer and preserver."" ""How long did you remain amongst them?"" cried Miss Kennyfeck.",1900-2000,33468
"Then there is no other
relief than to flee to the mountains in order to live in passes and
caves, seeking their preservation, not so much for their self-love,
but because of that for others. There, through lack of food, too much
heat, continual rains, and many other discomforts, they are generally
so disfigured and so weak that rivaling Job, they only live because
of a skin loosely stretched over their bones. How many contract
incurable diseases there, who dragging along all their life with
them prove themselves to be stages of the greatest pity! How many by
trampling under foot evident dangers, in hastening to the consolation
of their sheep, to confess the sick, to aid the dying, either gave
themselves into the hands of the enemy to be the victims of their
cruelty, or offered themselves a willing sacrifice to the precipices
of the mountains and to the shipwrecks of the seas! How many, since
the world is unworthy of their noble and Christian intercourse, and,
it seems, tried to cast from itself, wander for months at a time,
naked, an hungered, persecuted, followed on all sides by the shadow
of death, without other consolation than that of God, in whose hands
they desire to finish their lives, delivering to Him their wearied
souls!",1600-1700,30397
"Such is the mixture of fact and fable which Herodotus learned from the
traders and travellers of Greece. We know nothing of these tribes but
the names. Their ancestors may have dwelt for thousands of years on the
Russian plains; their descendants may still make up part of the great
Russian people and retain some of their old-time habits and customs; but
of their doings history takes no account. The Scythians, who occupied the south of Russia, came into contact with
the Greek trading colonies north of the Black Sea, and gained from them
some little veneer of civilization. They aided the Greeks in their
commerce, took part in their caravans to the north and east, and spent
some portion of the profits of their peaceful labor in objects of art
made for them by Greek artists.",1900-2000,25625
"IF an electrical Cake is dipp'd in Water, it is thereby made a Conductor
of Electricity, the Water hanging about it transmitting the electrical
Effluvia in such a manner, that a Person standing thereon can by no
means be electrified enough to attract the leaf Gold at the smallest
Distance; though the Person standing upon the same Cake when dry,
attracted a Piece of fine Thread hanging at the Distance of two Feet
from his Finger. We must here observe that the Cake being of an unctuous
Substance, the Water will no where lie uniformly thereon, but adhere in
separate Moleculae; so that in this Instance the Electricity jumps from
one Particle of Water to another, till the Whole is dissipated. FROM the Appearance of the Threads amongst which I rub the Tube, I can
frequently judge, though the Spirit may be many Feet distant from them,
whether or no it will fire; because when the Persons standing upon the
Wax are made electrical enough to fire the Spirit, the Threads repel
each other at their lower Parts, where they are not confin'd, to a
considerable Distance, and this Distance is in Proportion as the Threads
are made electrical. IF two Persons stand upon electrical Cakes at about a Yard's Distance
from each other, one of which Persons, for the Sake of Distinction, we
will call A, the other B: If A when electrified touches B, A loses
almost all his Electricity at that Touch only, which is receiv'd by B
and stopp'd by the electrical Cake; if A is immediately electrified
again to the same Degree as before and touches B, the Snapping is less
upon the Touch; and this Snapping, upon electrifying A, grows less and
less, till B being impregnated with Electricity, though receiv'd at
Intervals, the Snapping will no longer be sensible.",1700-1800,46168

"Seeking not to
trade with oppressors, he refuses to gratify his palate with sugars
prepared by the slave labour: under inward pressure to visit the West
Indies, he has anxious scruples about taking passage on a ship owned by
the West India Company, but decides that he may do so if he pays a sum
sufficiently larger than that demanded to compensate the labour involved
on another basis than that of slavery. At last--and here the crisis of
his experience draws near--he feels himself inwardly bound to go to
England; and decides that it is his duty to travel in the steerage,
because forsooth the adornments of the cabin have cost vain and
degrading labour. The horrors of a steerage passage in those days are
well known to us from other sources; and among our visions of the
martyrs of Truth we may well preserve the picture of John Woolman, his
patient Quaker face upturned at midnight through the hatch, panting for
a breath of air.",1700-1800,37311

daughter to the foresaid Guie earle of Flanders, which marriage was
concluded by Henrie bishop of Lincolne, and the earle Warren, being
sent ouer as ambassadours by king Edward, vnto the said earle Guie for
the same purpose. In the yeare following, the said earle of Flanders,
togither with his wife, comming to visit the French king at Corbeill,
were arrested, and sent to Paris, there to remaine as prisoners,

"CLAIRVOYANCE IN TIME: THE PAST. Clairvoyance in time--that is to say, the power of reading the past
and the future--is, like all the other varieties, possessed by
different people in very varying degrees, ranging from the man who has
both faculties fully at his command, down to one who only occasionally
gets involuntary and very imperfect glimpses or reflections of these
scenes of other days. A person of the latter type might have, let us
say, a vision of some event in the past; but it would be liable to the
most serious distortion, and even if it happened to be fairly accurate
it would almost certainly be a mere isolated picture, and he would
probably be quite unable to relate it to what had occurred before or
after it, or to account for anything unusual which might appear in it. The trained man, on the other hand, could follow the drama connected
with his picture backwards or forwards to any extent that might seem
desirable, and trace out with equal ease the causes which had led up
to it or the results which it in turn would produce. We shall probably find it easier to grasp this somewhat difficult
section of our subject if we consider it in the subdivisions which
naturally suggest themselves, and deal first with the vision which
looks backwards into the past, leaving for later examination that
which pierces the veil of the future.",1900-2000,29399

following oath:--

ourselves and our children to our country’s cause!_”

This great public meeting included all the large political unions, and
its solemn enthusiasm was remarkable for the same fervor and zeal of
the old Puritan councils. Its solemn oath was taken while Parliament
was reassembling in its two Houses. On that afternoon the House of Lords
took up first the disfranchising of the boroughs, and a week of

dissociated himself from partisanship. Three treasures in particular
does this little temple hold: Giotto's ""Coronation of the Virgin""; the
della Robbia altar relief, and Mino da Fiesole's tabernacle. Giotto's

"I have now taught you to make two sorts of the Water of Paradise; and
know, my Child, that the first way is the best; though it be made with
some danger, longer time, and more charge; for the Vinegar is all good,
yet the red Oil is the best; its time is alike unto the end, and though
it be more tedious before you obtain the red Oil, yet it fixes it self
in a short time, if it come to the Matter or fix'd Stone, into a simple
Essence in greater redness; but when the _Mercury_ comes to the fix'd
stone, it holds on a long time in ascending and descending before it
die, and when it is quite dead, it makes the red fix'd Stone again into
a fixt colour, so covering the red stone with its coldness, that the red
stone becomes white again, then must you boil it again gently with a
small Fire, till it begin to be yellow, prosecuting the Fire from one
degree to another, as the Colour is higher and stronger, and that so
long till it attain to a perfect redness, which requires a long time
before it be done, which is not requisite in the red Oil; for the red
Oil dies or coagulates forthwith the stone, the one fixing it self with
the other into a simple Essence, in a short time. Therefore I tell
thee, my Child, that the time of the Oyl is alike long in the end,
though it appear to be of a shorter time with the _Mercury_, but it is
equally long at the end of the Work, therefore I tell you the Art of
both Works, that you may the better understand the Art to make the Oyl
from the innermost Nature of the Stone, which is found afterwards. The Oyl was unknown to the Ancients, for my Grandfather with his
Companions found it with great labour and length of time. So there are two ways to dissolve the Stone, and to poure upon it the

"A lady who has once ridden one of these three-pommeled saddles will
never care to use any other kind. It renders horseback riding almost
perfectly safe, for, if the rider has learned to use it properly, it
will be nearly impossible for a horse to throw her. It gives her a much
firmer seat even than that of a gentleman in his saddle, and at the same
time, if rightly used, does not interfere with that easy grace so
essential to good riding. In many of our large cities where this saddle
is employed twenty lady riders may now be seen in the park or on the
road where formerly there was one; and this is wholly due to the sense
of security it gives, especially to a timid rider, a feeling never
attainable in the two-pommeled saddle, where the seat is maintained
chiefly by the balance, or by using the reins as a means of support. By sitting erect, taking a firm hold upon the second pommel with the
right knee, and pressing the left knee up against the third pommel, a
perfectly secure seat is obtained, from which the rider cannot be
shaken, provided the saddle is well girthed and the horse does not fall,
while her hands are left free to manage the reins, a very important
point where the horse is spirited or restless.",1800-1900,40684

beauty of the sketch in many parts is extreme, and its character
distinctly that of Shakspeare, vigorous and even quaint, thoughtful and

"American society, taking for its point of departure labour, based
upon a condition of general ease on one side, and on a system of
common elementary education on the other, and moving forward with
the religious principle for its lode-star, seems destined to reach
a degree of prosperity, power, and happiness, much superior to what
we have attained with our semi-feudal organisation, and our fixed
antipathy against all moral rule and all authority. It presents,
doubtless, especially in the newer States, many imperfections, and it
will have to submit to various modifications; this is the lot of all
unfinished works, even when God himself is the maker. But a few errors
and follies are of little import in the eyes of those whose thoughts
are occupied with the great interests of the future rather than with
the paltry troubles of the present hour. Of little moment are the
disgust and disappointment that a European of delicate nerves may have
to encounter, if, for the purpose of killing time, he ventures upon
a western steamboat, or into a western tavern; so much the worse for
him, if he has fallen into a country where there is no place for an
idle tourist, seeking only for amusement! Let the foreigner smile at

"As to their
Religion, it was given them by a Law-giver, whose name was _Zertoost_,
whose birth was strange, and breeding and visions miraculous; the names
of his Father and Mother were _Espintaman_ and _Dodoo_, he was born in
_China_, and great fame going of him when young, the King of that
Country endeavoured his destruction, but could not bring it to pass, for
those who were sent to destroy him, had their sinews shrunk; he being
twelve or thirteen years of age, was taken with a great sickness, the
King hearing thereof, sent Physicians to destroy him; but _Zertoost_
sensible of their practise, refused their Physick, and fled with his
Father and Mother into _Persia_; in his way meeting with Rivers, he
congeal’d them them to ice, and so went over: he arrived at _Persia_ in
the time of the Raign of _Gustasph_; it was in that Country that at his
request to God, he being purified, was carried up into heaven, where he
heard the Almighty speaking, as in flames of fire, who revealed to him
the works of the Creation, and what was to come, and gave him Laws for
the better government and establishment of Religion: _Zertoost_ desired
to live alwayes, that he might instruct the world in Religion; but God
answered, _That if he should live never so long, yet_ Lucifer _would do
more harm then he should do good: but if he desired to live so long as
the world endured he might_. God also presented to _Zertoost_ the seven
ages or times of the _Persian_ Monarchy; the first was the Golden Age,
the days of _Guiomaras_, second, the Silver, the dayes of _Fraydhun_:
third, the Brazen, the dayes of _Kaykodoy_, the fourth, the Tin, the
dayes of _Lorasph_; fifth, Leaden, the dayes of _Bahaman_, sixth, the
Steel, the dayes of _Darab Segner;_ the seventh, the Iron Age, in the
Raign of _Yesdegerd_: He finding by this that the times would be worse
and worse, desired to live no longer than till he had discharged his
Message, and then that he might be translated to the same place of
glory; so he was reduced to his proper sense, and remained in heaven
many dayes; and then having received the Book of the Law, and the
heavenly fire, he was conveyed by an Angel to earth again. But the Angel
had no sooner left him, but _Lucifer_ met him; but notwithstanding his
perswasions, he went on in his designs of revealing the Law, which he
did first to his Father and Mother, and by their means it came to the
ears of _Gustasph_, then King of _Persia_, who sending for him, he told
the King every circumstance, so that the King began to incline to his
religion, often sending for and conversing with him. The Churchmen of
that time endeavoured to put infamy upon _Zertoost_, by perswading the
King that he was an Impostor and of unclean living, for that he had the
bones of humane bodies under his bed, the King hearing this sent to
search, and found it so to be, for these Church-men had caused them to
be conveyed thither; wherefore _Zertoost_, by order of the King, was put
in prison: but there happened an occasion, that he was not only soon
released, but also brought into the Kings favour; for the King having a
Horse, that he prized, that fell sick, and no person able to cure him,
_Zertoost_ undertook the cure, and performed it; and working some other
miracles, was now of good credit, and esteemed as a man come from God;
so that now his Book gained an esteem, and the King himself told him,
That _if he would grant him four demands_, _he would believe his_ _Law,
and be a Professor thereof_. The demands were these; First, _That he
might ascend to Heaven, and descend when he list_.",1600-1700,50949
"Thus, in the table of categories of the Practical
reason under the title of Modality, the Permitted, and forbidden (in a
practical objective point of view, possible and impossible) have
almost the same meaning in common language as the next category,
duty and contrary to duty. Here, however, the former means what
coincides with, or contradicts, a merely possible practical precept
(for example, the solution of all problems of geometry and mechanics);
the latter, what is similarly related to a law actually present in the
reason; and this distinction is not quite foreign even to common
language, although somewhat unusual. For example, it is forbidden to
an orator, as such, to forge new words or constructions; in a
certain degree this is permitted to a poet; in neither case is there
any question of duty. For if anyone chooses to forfeit his
reputation as an orator, no one can prevent him.",1700-1800,5683

claim to tribute in any form, he delivered his American captives, ten in
number, without any ransom; and stipulated, that hereafter no Americans
should be made slaves or forced to hard labor, and still further, that
""any Christians whatever, captives in Algiers,"" making their escape and
taking refuge on board an American ship of war, should be safe from all
requisition or reclamation.",1700-1800,35222

"Her hair was white with “the incomparable
whiteness of aged hair,” and there were the indelible marks of age on
the sweet, earnest face, but this dear old lady was “sunny.” She had had
her own full share of sorrows and worries, and she had taken them all
very much to heart--as people must whose hearts are big enough to
take things to at all--and as tender as hearts really ought to be. But
somehow or other, she had learned the {003}secret of not being overcome
by the worries and the sorrows, and so, sitting there knitting that
peerless June morning, she and the sunshine together seemed to glorify
everything about them. [Illustration: 0015]

regular form through the House of Burgesses; and a Congress of delegates
of nine or ten of the States had met at New York (October), and passed
resolutions, claiming for the provincial assemblies the exclusive right
of taxation. At home the merchants had begun to feel the effects of the

"The stock of Cadmus became the ruling family,
  and remained so for a long time: the history of his descendants,
  who were kings of Thebes, and comprised under their dominion the
  greatest part of Boeotia, constitutes a main branch of Grecian
  mythology: among them were Oedipus, Laius, Eteocles, and
  Polynices. After the capture of Thebes by the Epigoni, 1215, the
  Boeotians were expelled by Thracian hordes, and settled at Arne in
  Thessaly; at the time of the Dorian migration they returned to the
  land of their forefathers, and mingled with the Aeolians of those
  quarters. Not long after, upon the death of Xuthus, royalty was
  abolished, 1126. Boeotia was now divided into as many small states
  as it contained cities; of these, next to Thebes, the most eminent
  were the towns of Plataeae, Thespiae, Tanagra, and Chaeronea, each
  of which had its own separate district and peculiar form of
  government; but all those constitutions appear to have been
  commuted into oligarchies about the time of the Persian war. Such
  had been the case even with Thebes, although she had received as a
  legislator, Philolaus from Corinth; but the code given by this
  individual cannot have been attended with the desired effect, as
  the government was continually fluctuating between a licentious
  democracy and an overbearing oligarchy.",1800-1900,39747

"At other times I have seen the noblest instances of self-devotion; men
have saved the lives of their fellow-creatures at the peril of their
own, without a prospect of reward if successful, and with the certainty
that their families would be left destitute if they perished. From these considerations, I have been induced to wish, that the results
of the experience, talent, and genius of the most distinguished
commanders, and men of science, should be united in the formation of one
great Institution, which would in itself embrace every possible means
for the preservation of life from the hazards of shipwreck. Though many individuals have employed their time, their attention, and
often exposed their personal safety for this object, yet nearly the
whole of the most extensive and dangerous parts of our coasts are left
without any means having been adopted, any precautions taken, for
rendering assistance to vessels in distress; and, winter after winter,
we have the most afflicting details of the consequences attendant on
this lamentable apathy to human misery--an awful destruction of life, on
almost every shore which surrounds the British dominions: acts have even
sometimes been perpetrated at which humanity shudders, and which have
caused other nations to cast reproach and opprobrium on the British
name. But individual efforts, however meritorious in themselves, are unequal
to produce all the benefits contemplated, or to remedy all the evils,
attendant on one of the most tremendous of perils to which human nature
is exposed, and which is most likely to fall upon those who are in the
very prime of manhood, and in the discharge of the most active and
important duties of life. From the calamity of shipwreck no one can say
that he may at all times remain free; and whilst he is now providing
only for the safety of others, a day may come which will render the
cause his own.",1800-1900,27322

"Whereas
animals which have much red blood, and respire much, have the power of
keeping themselves in a temperature considerably higher than that of the
surrounding atmosphere, other animals, as _frogs_ and _serpents_, are
nearly of the same temperature with it; and those animals which have the
largest respiratory organs, as birds, are the warmest; also the degree
of heat is in some measure proportionable to the quantity of air that is
respired in a given time, as in violent exercise. It has been observed, that animals in a medium hotter than the blood
have a power of preserving themselves in the same temperature. In this
case the heat is probably carried off by perspiration, while the blood
ceases to receive, or give out, any heat; and Dr. Crawford finds, that
when an animal is placed in a warm medium the colour of the venous blood
approaches nearer to that of the arterial than when it is placed in a
colder medium; and also, that it phlogisticates the air less than in the
former case; so that in these circumstances respiration has not the same
effect that it has in a colder temperature, in giving the body an
additional quantity of heat; which is an excellent provision in nature,
as the heat is not wanted, but, on the contrary, would prove
inconvenient. LECTURE XXXII.",1700-1800,37682

carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water

the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid
from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his

pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the
noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the

same; almost always chearful, sometimes, with decency, facetious. This
gave rise to a rumour that he expected a pardon, or meditated an escape;
which was most industriously propagated, to lessen the merit of his
behaviour, by the same instruments that had been always made use of to
wrest every circumstance to his disadvantage, and asperse him. Some of
those _wretches_ were employed, during his trial, to send up to town, for

_sophistical_ comments, be brought to carry the appearance of _guilt_, in

infusions, that the handful of meal in the vessel should not spend,
nor the little oyl in the cruise fail the widow, during the time of
drought and dearth._

_O look on my soul, which as a widow, is now desolate and forsaken:
Let not those saving truths I have formerly learned now fail my
memory; nor the sweet effusions of thy Spirit, which I have sometime
felt, now be wanting to my heart in this famine of ordinary and
wholsom food for the refreshing of my soul._

_Which yet I had rather chuse then to feed from those hands who mingle
my bread with ashes, and my wine with gall, rather tormenting, then
teaching me; whose mouths are proner to bitter reproaches of me, then
to hearty prayers for me._

_Thou knowest, O Lord of truth, how oft they wrest thy holy Scriptures
to my destruction, (which are clear for their subjection, and my
preservation) O let it not be to their damnation._

_Thou knowest how some men (under colour of long prayers) have sought
to devour the houses of their Brethren, their King, and their God. O
let not those mens balms break my head, nor their Cordials oppress my
heart, I will evermore pray against their wickedness._

_From the poyson under their tongues, from the snares of their lips,
from the fire, and the swords of their words ever deliver me, O Lord,
and all those loyal and religious hearts, who desire and delight in
the prosperity of my soul, and who seek by their prayers to relieve
this sadness and solitude of thy servant, O my King and my God._

"There is no Truth in this. That he has contradicted what I have said
concerning him: Neither is there in this: On the contrary, he has
certified it all in a Letter to a noble Lord, a Letter which you Mr.
_Fielding_ know of; and that noble Personage also countenances, by his
Character of this Gentleman, all that his Conduct in the Matter had
before spoken in his Favour. It has been said that the Certificates and Affidavits in the Lord
Mayor's Hands, sent up from _Abbotsbury_, and attested by this
Gentleman, and by the Church-wardens and Overseers of the Parish are
forged.",1700-1800,51334
"FURTHER ANNALS OF THE SANCTUARY

All of this was fifteen years ago. Since then there have been some
interesting changes, but they are in the line of growth. Thirteen
Bears in view at one time was my highest record, and that after sundown;
but I am told that as many as twenty or twenty-five Bears are now to be
seen there at once in June and July, when the wildwood foods are scarce. Most of them are Blackbears, but there are always a few Grizzlies about.",1900-2000,27887
"The warning which this town received of our coming towards them from St.
Domingo, by the space of 20 days before our arrival here, was cause that
they had both fortified and every way prepared for their best defence. As also that they had carried and conveyed away all their treasure and
principal substance. The ransom of 110,000 ducats thus concluded on, as is aforesaid, the
same being written, and expressing for nothing more than the town of
Carthagena, upon the payment of the said ransom we left the said town
and drew some part of our soldiers into the priory or abbey, standing a
quarter of an English mile below the town upon the harbour water-side,
the same being walled with a wall of stone; which we told the Spaniards
was yet ours, and not redeemed by their composition. Whereupon they,
finding the defect of their contract, were contented to enter into
another ransom for all places, but specially for the said house, as also
the blockhouse or castle, which is upon the mouth of the inner harbour. And when we asked as much for the one as for the other, they yielded to
give a thousand crowns for the abbey, leaving us to take our pleasure
upon the blockhouse, which they said they were not able to ransom,
having stretched themselves to the uttermost of their powers; and
therefore the said blockhouse was by us undermined, and so with
gunpowder blown up in pieces.",1483-1600,3334
"we talked
about various things; the character of the people,--about her solitude,
etc., till she left the room to help about dinner, I suppose, for she
did not return for an age. The old dog had vanished; a fat curly-haired
dog honoured us with his company for some time, but finally manifested a
wish to get out, so we were left alone. At last she returned, followed
by the maid and dinner, which made us all more comfortable; and we had
some very pleasant conversation, in the midst of which time passed
quicker than we supposed, for at last W---- found that it was half-past
three, and we had fourteen or fifteen miles before us.",1800-1900,1700

"SECT. 1. If your principal boys ask too hard questions, make it a rule
never to tell them; it would be excusing them from a necessary part of
their duty. Tell them it is easy enough, and send them back; the more
pains they take to acquire their learning, the longer they will retain
it.",1700-1800,31155
"On her way downstairs to the dining-room, the girl met her master at
the foot of the stairs. He looked ""queer"" and very strange in the face,
but did not appear to be in pain, according to her statement. He
looked twice at her, yet did not speak, though it was his custom, but
passed on. Mr. Bravo was alone after the departure of his wife and Mrs. Cox, until
the time when he passed the housemaid at the foot of the stairs. He
entered his wife's dressing-room, and the maid Mrs. Bravo's bedroom.",1900-2000,43840
"Thou never was't my debtor. I'm thy slave;
     And in the pleasing chains would live for ever. To view that lovely form! those radiant eyes,
     And listen to the language of those lips! What sum can be a recompense for these
     O!",1700-1800,7840
"Every thing that they see or hear serves to fix impressions, call
forth emotions, and associate ideas, that give a sexual character
to the mind. False notions of beauty and delicacy stop the growth
of their limbs and produce a sickly soreness, rather than delicacy
of organs; and thus weakened by being employed in unfolding instead
of examining the first associations, forced on them by every
surrounding object, how can they attain the vigour necessary to
enable them to throw off their factitious character?--where find
strength to recur to reason and rise superior to a system of
oppression, that blasts the fair promises of spring? This cruel
association of ideas, which every thing conspires to twist into all
their habits of thinking, or, to speak with more precision, of
feeling, receives new force when they begin to act a little for
themselves; for they then perceive, that it is only through their
address to excite emotions in men, that pleasure and power are to
be obtained. Besides, all the books professedly written for their
instruction, which make the first impression on their minds, all
inculcate the same opinions. Educated in worse than Egyptian
bondage, it is unreasonable, as well as cruel, to upbraid them with
faults that can scarcely be avoided, unless a degree of native
vigour be supposed, that falls to the lot of very few amongst
mankind.",1700-1800,3420
"Insomuch as the whole
island, being some two or three miles about, is cast into grounds of
gardening and orchards. After six weeks' abode in this place, we put to sea the last of March;
where, after two or three days, a great Ship which we had taken at St.
Domingo, and thereupon was called The New Year's Gift, fell into a great
leak, being laden with ordnance, hides, and other spoils, and in the
night she lost the company of our fleet. Which being missed the next
morning by the General, he cast about with the whole fleet, fearing some
great mischance to be happened unto her, as in very deed it so fell out;
for her leak was so great that her men were all tired with pumping. But
at the last, having found her, and the bark Talbot in her company, which
stayed by great hap with her, they were ready to take their men out of
her for the saving of them.",1483-1600,3334
"First, put into the boxe
three loose counters, then put in the glued pile of counters with the
hole upper-most, then put into the hole a Die, and lastly three other
loose whole Counters, and cover it. Draw this boxe of Counters, and say,
Gentlemen, here is a boxe of Barbarie gold, it was left me as a Legacie
by a deceased friend, upon condition I should employ it well and
honestly. Now sirs it was my fortune as I was travelling, to be
benighted, and so forced to seeke for lodging, and as it happened, I
tooke into an house of entertainment, where calling for my Ostesse, I
drew my stocke, and said, what must I give you mine Ostesse for my meat,
drinke, and lodging this night?",1600-1700,34375
"But that which I admir’d most of all amongst them, was the Virginity of
their Language, not deflowerd by the Mixture of any other Dialect. The
Purity of the _Latin_ was debauch’d by the _Vandals_, and hunn’d into
Corruption by that barbarous People; but the Sincerity of the _British_
Tongue remains inviolable. ’Tis a Tongue (it seems) not made for every
Mouth, as appears by an _English_ Gentleman one Day in my Company, who
having got a _Welsh_ Polysyllable into his Throat, was almost choak’d
with Consonants, had I not, by clapping him on the Back, made him
disgorge a Guttural or two, and so sav’d him.",1700-1800,56276
"You're always seeing Indians again. Here it has been--one day and
you declared that they were gone; then the very next day you've seen
them again."" ""Well, they showed themselves to me; I didn't want them,"" said Griggs
dryly. ""They're an artful lot. Never been away at all, I believe.",1900-2000,25429
"To which the Barber pleaded, for excuse, that it was no
great matter, for he was to leave the shop in a weeks time, and to
remove to another, and therefore it would not annoy him much. This
action, and answer, fell out for our Gallant, as fit as pudding for a
Friers-mouth; and therefore he was resolved to prosecute his intended
project; and he did so tickle himself with laughing at the conceit he
intended, that the Barber could hardly shave him, without indangering
the cutting of his Throat or Chaps. But that was done in time, and our Gentleman was delivered from the
imprisonment of the Chair, when in the prosecution of his intended
Project, he asked _Cutbert_ whether he had any sorts of sweet powder? He
shewed him what he had below, and that not pleasing him, he went up
stairs to fetch more: no sooner did he mount up the stairs, but down
went our Gallants breeches, and there in the middle of the Shop, he laid
the biggest load he could exonerate himself of. He made all the haste he
could, and just as the Barber descended down stairs, up went his
Breeches.",1600-1700,52822

"In
the meantime they may be initiated into the practice by electing their
Municipal government, and after some experience they will be in train to
elect their State government. I think it would not only be good policy
but right to say, that the people shall have the right of electing their
Church Ministers, otherwise their Ministers will hold by authority from
the Pope. I do not make it a compulsive article, but to put it in their
power to use it when they please.",1700-1800,37702
"KING EDWARD. What drum is this that thunders forth this march,
To start the tender Cupid in my bosom? Poor shipskin, how it brawls with him that beateth it! Go, break the thundring parchment bottom out,
And I will teach it to conduct sweet lines
Unto the bosom of a heavenly Nymph;
For I will use it as my writing paper,
And so reduce him from a scolding drum
To be the herald and dear counsel bearer
Betwixt a goddess and a mighty king.",1483-1600,1770
"He was blackguarded and abused in every
possible way. He was accused of having shown incapacity while General and
of having embezzled public funds while President. He was nicknamed ""the
Step-Father of his country.""",1700-1800,11702
"[Sidenote: An agreement betweene the duke of Burgognie & the Dolphin.] [Sidenote: _Titus Liuius._]

[Sidenote: A conspiracie in Rone.] This agreement was made the sixt of Iulie in the yeare 1419. It was
ingrossed by notaries, signed with their hands, and sealed with their
great seales of armes: but as the sequele shewed, hart thought not
what toong spake, nor mind meant not that hand wrote.",1483-1600,46671
"I
was the Duke of Argyle's guest; and I had no reason to suppose that he
adopted the prejudices and resentments of the Duchess of Hamilton. I knew it was the rule of modern high life not to drink to any body;
but, that I might have the satisfaction for once to look the duchess
in the face, with a glass in my hand, I with a respectful air
addressed her, 'My Lady Duchess, I have the honour to drink your
grace's good health.' I repeated the words audibly, and with a steady
countenance. This was, perhaps, rather too much; but some allowance
must be made for human feelings.",1700-1800,6018
"An easie head may soon demonstrate, that the pre-mentioned Planters, by
Tolerating all Religions, had immazed themselves in the most intolerable
confusions and inextricable thraldomes the world ever heard of. I am
perswaded the Devill himselfe was never willing with their proceedings,
for feare it would breake his wind and wits to attend such a Province. I
speak it seriously according to my meaning. How all Religions should
enjoy their Liberty, Justice its due regularity, Civill cohabitation
morall honesty, in one and the same Jurisdiction, is beyond the Artique
of my comprehension.",1600-1700,34974
"The power of vengeance now implants it selfe,
   Upon the hauty mountains of my brest:
   Plaies with her goary coulours of revenge,
   Whom I respect as leaves of boasting greene,
   That change their coulour when the winter comes,
   When I shall vaunt as victor in revenge. Enter a Messenger. How now sirra, what newes?",1483-1600,1496
"I
therefore wound up my report with the statement that we were ready for
sea, and could sail at literally a moment's notice. ""So much the better,"" remarked the admiral, ""and, since there is nothing
to be gained by further delay, you had better make a start forthwith, so
that you may be able to work your way out through the channel and secure
an offing before nightfall. Now, have you formed any plans for the
conduct of this cruise?""",1900-2000,21064

"For at doomes day only, the soules shall returne to

wherefore they cannot so be séene, vnlesse they take some outward

"As for the so-called Progressive convention, it is sufficient to say
that there is no attempt to conceal the fact that it was financed and
controlled by three conspicuous representatives of the plutocracy which
largely owns and rules the land. Political parties are responsive to the interests of those who finance
them. This is the infallible test of their character and applied to the
Republican, Democratic and Progressive parties, these parties stand
forth as the several political expressions of the several divisions of
the capitalist class. The funds of all these parties are furnished by
the capitalist class for the reason, and only for the reason, that they
represent the interests of that class.",1900-2000,34012
"He had enemies among his
own subjects too, who would have been pleased to turn him off and have
his cousin Guy of Burgundy to govern them, because they thought he had
a better right to the dukedom of Normandy than William had. Perhaps this
was so, but the latter had too determined a will to yield, and he had
been a leader nearly all his life. When he was only five years old, he formed a battalion of boys of his
own age whom he drilled in military practice every day. It must have
been a pretty sight, and no doubt the little fellows fancied themselves
real warriors.",1800-1900,47121

"All these

do not believe. For what is impossible for you by all the works of the
law, which are many and yet useless, you shall fulfil in an easy and

been told, by very good Authority, that, in tempestuous Weather at Sea,
great Flakes of Fire are frequently seen passing not only in the Air,

the Vessel or Boat passing swiftly through it, I asked a Sailor, At what
Time that Appearance happened most frequently? He told me, It most
generally happen’d after tempestuous Weather; or, as his Term was, dirty
Weather at Sea. I think this will sufficiently shew the Existence of this Fire in the
Air; and, if any Regard be had to what I think its Power and Use is in
the World, that it will intrude itself and force its Way into any Thing
where less of it is, and so join itself to it by being in a greater

in calm upon the mountains, motionless, when the rage of the North
and of all the fiery winds is asleep.' As I finished these lines, I

to the Queen's enemies, and giving them aid, without the realm,"" which
was made a capital offence by the statute of Edward III. It appears that Gregg was a native of Montrose, in Scotland, and having
received such instruction as the grammar-schools of the place afforded,

completed his education at Aberdeen university, where he pursued these
studies which were calculated to fit him for the profession of the
church, for which he was intended. London, however, held forth so many
attractions to his youthful eye, that the wishes of his relatives were
soon overruled; and having visited that city, with good introductions,

thought as in every other development; the present suffers from the
past, and the future struggles hard in escaping from the
present.--MAX MUeLLER, _Science of Thought_, 617. Most of the great
positive evils of the world are in themselves removable, and will, if
human affairs continue to improve, be in the end reduced within narrow
limits. Poverty in any sense implying suffering may be completely
extinguished by the wisdom of society combined with the good sense and
providence of individuals.--All the grand sources, in short, of human
suffering are in a great degree, many of them almost entirely,

succeeded to the Throne.----


ELIZABETH

It was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad
Ministers---Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have
committed such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men
connived at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by
many people been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis
Walsingham, and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State
were deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh!",1700-1800,1212
"It relates not so much to the magnet
as to the Copernican theory of the universe, which doctrine Gilbert had
eagerly espoused, and which he was the first in England to proclaim. It is known from a letter to Barlow, printed in 1616, that he intended
to add to it certain chapters descriptive of some of his instruments,
but he had not completed these before his death. The first book treats
of historic accounts of the loadstone, of its origin and properties,
of iron ores in general, and of the fables and vain opinions which in
the handling of Paracelsus and of the schoolmen had grown up around the
magnet. The second book is on the magnetic motions, and primarily on
the attractions and repulsions between loadstones, between loadstone
and iron, and between magnetic needles. In this book occurs the notable
digression upon the subject of amber and the electric forces of amber
and of other substances which when rubbed show, as he discovered,
similar electrical powers.",1483-1600,45893

"""Yes, you can git there by Indian Ridge way, but it's more dangerous. You're likely to lose your way, for that's a trail that's seldom

(Macmillan), and of the first part of it, the _Critique of AEsthetic
Judgment_, by Meredith (Clarendon Press). This last book has
introductory essays and notes. The student beginning the study of Kant will find _Watson's Selections
from Kant_ (MacLehose & Sons) useful if he cannot read the _Critiques_

"At his Entrance into
_Muxadavad_, he found the City in the utmost Consternation. The Suba was
in Possession of his Palace, on the other Side of the River, with some
Troops about him, amongst whom he distributed several Lack of Rupees;
but the rest, as had been foreseen, dispersed. A few Hours after, in a
Fit of Despair, he withdrew, accompanied only by Five Persons, and took
with him a large Sum in Gold, and Jewels to an immense Value. Upon the
News of this, _Meer Jaffeir_ immediately passed the River, entered the
Palace, and assumed the Title of Suba, without any Opposition. At the
same time, he seized the Treasures of his Predecessor; and Things being
in this Situation, he dispatched Advice instantly to Colonel _Clive_.",1700-1800,52518
"The title helped, as Byron himself recognised with cheerful cynicism. Lords, of course, had tried their hands at poetry before, but never with
much success, whether they were good lords or wicked. Their compositions
had amounted to little more than ingenious exercises in rhyme. Either they
had failed to put their personalities into their poems or they had had no
personalities worth speaking of to put into them. One could say that, with
varying degrees of truth, of Rochester, Roscommon, Sheffield, and
Carlisle.",1700-1800,41701

It cannot but seem strange, that, after having so often declared the
Acid of Sea-salt to be incapable of dissolving Silver, we should
direct either Nitre or Sea-salt indifferently to be employed in
composing a cement, which is to produce an Acid capable of eating
out all the Silver mixed with Gold. It is easy to conceive how the
Nitrous Acid extricated from its basis by means of the Vitriolic Acid
may produce this effect: but if Sea-salt instead of Nitre be made an
ingredient in the cement, its Acid, though set at liberty in the same
manner by the Vitriolic Acid, must at first sight appear unable to
answer the end.",1700-1800,46998

"But one such sum now would put all upon their legs, and now the
King would have the Parliament give him money when they are in an ill
humour and will not be willing to give any, nor are very able, and besides
every body distrusts what they give the King will be lost; whereas six
months hence, when they see that the King can live without them, and is
become steady, and to manage what he has well, he doubts not but their
doubts would be removed, and would be much more free as well as more able
to give him money. He told me how some of his enemies at the Duke of
York's had got the Duke of York's commission for the Commissioners of his
estate changed, and he and Brouncker and Povy left out: that this they did
do to disgrace and impose upon him at this time; but that he, though he
values not the thing, did go and tell the Duke of York what he heard, and
that he did not think that he had given him any reason to do this, out of
his belief that he would not be as faithful and serviceable to him as the
best of those that have got him put out. Whereupon the Duke of York did
say that it arose only from his not knowing whether now he would have time
to regard his affairs; and that, if he should, he would put him into the
commission with his own hand, though the commission be passed. He
answered that he had been faithful to him, and done him good service
therein, so long as he could attend it; and if he had been able to have
attended it more, he would not have enriched himself with such and such
estates as my Lord Chancellor hath got, that did properly belong to his
Royal Highness, as being forfeited to the King, and so by the King's gift
given to the Duke of York.",1600-1700,4183

"The Indians
whose treatment of the females is mildest, and who pay most deference
to their opinions, are by no means the most distinguished for their
virtues; nor is this deference attended by any increase of attachment,
since they are equally willing with the most brutal husband, to
prostitute their wives to strangers. On the other hand, the tribes
among whom the women are very much debased, possess the loftiest sense
of honour, the greatest liberality, and all the good qualities of
which their situation demands the exercise. Where the women can aid
in procuring subsistence for the tribe, they are treated with more
equality, and their importance is proportioned to the share which they
take in that labour; while in countries where subsistence is chiefly
procured by the exertions of the men, the women are considered and
treated as burdens.",1600-1700,52442
"Here we remained until four in the afternoon, entered

palanquin there are eight bearers, four of whom are employed at a
time; one mussuaulchee, or torch-bearer, runs by the side, along with
one baugh-whaller, to carry boxes made of tin, and called patarahs. Each man carries two slung to a stick over his shoulder.",1800-1900,43586
"The author takes the book as a writing or a speech;
the owner interprets the book as being the mute instrument merely of
the delivering of the speech to him or to the public, that is, as a
copy. The author does not have ownership rights over the thing,
namely, the copy of the book (for the owner may burn that copy before
the author's face); instead, the author has an innate right, in the
author's own person, to wit, to hinder another from reading the copy
to the public without the author's consent, which consent can by no
means be presumed, because the author may have already given it
exclusively to another editor.] But while altering (abridging, augmenting or retouching) the book of
another, such as to re-work the book into what is substantially a new
book, such that it would be wrong to publish the new book in the name
of the author of the original book, the retouching of a book, in the
proper name of the publisher, is no counterfeit, and therefore is not
prohibited. For here, another author transacts, via his editor,
another business transaction that is different from the initial
business transaction transacted by the initial author, and
consequently does not intrude upon the initial author's initial
business transaction with the public; he represents not that author,
as speaking through him, but another.",1700-1800,46060
"i, p. 12), ""the lively emotions excited at a time
when multiplication and division, squaring and cubing, the rule of
three, the construction and equivalence of figures, with all their
manifold applications to industry, commerce, fine arts, and tactics,
were just as strange and wonderful as electrical phenomena are to us ...
and we shall cease to wonder that a mere form of thought, a lifeless
abstraction, should once have been regarded as the solution of every
problem; the cause of all existence; or that these speculations were
more than once revived in after ages."" Xenophanes of Colophon, one of the twelve Ionian cities of Asia Minor,
deserves, however, a passing reference. He, with Parmenides and Zeno,
are the chief representatives of the Eleatic school, so named from
the city in southwestern Italy where a Greek colony had settled. The
tendency of that school was toward metaphysical theories. He was the
first known observer to detect the value of fossils as evidences of the
action of water, but his chief claim to notice rests on the fact that,
passing beyond the purely physical speculations of the Ionian school, he
denied the idea of a primary substance, and theorized about the nature
and actions of superhuman beings.",1800-1900,39526

"Not the amount of heat but the manner in which this heat is made at
home is responsible for the difference we observe. Now, though the
total amount is the same in passing from the vernal to the autumnal
equinox as from the autumnal to the vernal, the time during which it is
received in either case varies from one hemisphere to the other. It is
summer in the former while it is winter in the latter and the
difference in the length of the two seasons due to the eccentricity of
the orbit makes a vast difference in the result. Winter affects the
maxima, summer the minima, attained. Of these opposite variations
presented to us by the two caps, the maxima, the one most difficult to
detect, is the easiest to explain, for the difference in the maxima
seems to be due to the surpassing length of the antarctic night.",1900-2000,47015
"The Emperor Napoleon went on to say that the supposed
    details of the scheme to overthrow the Government of England were of

    again taken up the idea of assassinating him, and was busily
    employed in making plans for effecting their purpose. He told me
    that Mazzini was very ill and he did not express any wish for his

Doctors would now gladly admit a form of prayer, if the people would

would be suspected of heretical pravity. The principle upon which extemporary prayer was originally introduced, is
no longer admitted. The Minister formerly, in the effusion of his
prayer, expected immediate, and perhaps perceptible inspiration, and
therefore thought it his duty not to think before what he should say.",1700-1800,2064

A LEGEND OF SERVICE

     It pleased the Lord of Angels (praise His name!) To hear, one day, report from those who came
     With pitying sorrow, or exultant joy,
     To tell of earthly tasks in His employ:
     For some were sorry when they saw how slow
     The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow;
     And some were glad because their eyes had seen,
     Along its banks, fresh flowers and living green. So, at a certain hour, before the throne
     The youngest angel, Asmiel, stood alone;
     Nor glad, nor sad, but full of earnest thought,
     And thus his tidings to the Master brought:
     ""Lord, in the city Lupon I have found
     ""Three servants of thy holy name, renowned
     ""Above their fellows. One is very wise,

"The evidence which we possess
on this very important subject consists of the words of Christ himself,
addressed to his Apostles respecting their mission, their own incidental
observations, and the facts which ecclesiastical history presents. From
all these sources of evidence we derive our belief that the office of
_witnessing_, which is absolutely untransferrable, was the peculiar
office of the twelve Apostles; that they were especially qualified by it
for the task of preaching and establishing the new Gospel, and that to
enable them to do so with sufficient effect, among the many and great
difficulties which the state of the world then presented, the miraculous
gifts of the Spirit were granted to them, with power to impart them to
whomsoever they would, and that this miraculous power was coexistent
with the apostolic age,--with what is variously called 'the age,' 'the
kingdom of God,' 'the kingdom of Christ,' 'the kingdom of heaven;' that
is, from the descent of the Holy Spirit to the abolition of Judaism on
the overthrow of Jerusalem. We find no evidence of miracles after that
time which is at all to be compared with that on which we rely
respecting the apostolic gifts; none which allows us to hesitate in our
opinion, that with the apostles expired the power of communicating
miraculous privileges; and that on them alone were such privileges
immediately conferred. These gifts of the Spirit served as a Divine
sanction to their testimony, and were therefore coexistent with that
testimony; and the same evidence which recorded their testimony after
their death, recorded the Divine sanction likewise; and upon this broad
and immutable foundation is built the Christian faith, against which,
according to the Saviour's promise, no opposition has prevailed or can
prevail. When some who could not deny the peculiarity of his mission,
but would not admit his pre-eminent claims, supposed him to be John the
Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or another of the prophets,

be 'the Christ, the Son of the living God.'",1800-1900,33672

especially, refused to obey Friedrich Wilhelm, on his accession; ""were
bound to obey the Kaiser in the first place."" He had to proceed softly
as well as swiftly; with the most delicate hand to get him of Spandau by
the collar, and put him under lock-and-key, him as a warning to others. For twenty years past, Brandenburg had been scoured by hostile armies,
which, especially the Kaiser's part of which, committed outrages new
in human history. In a year or two hence, Brandenburg became again the
theatre of business; Austrian Gallas advancing thither again (1644),
with intent ""to shut up Torstenson and his Swedes in Jutland,"" where
they had been chastising old Christian IV., now meddlesome again, for
the last time, and never a good neighbor to Sweden. Gallas could by
no means do what he intended: on the contrary, he had to run from
Torstenson, what feet could do; was hunted, he and his MERODE-BRUDER

a certain way. For a period of about two hundred years, from the time of
Gaspar da Salo to that of the Bergonzi, the varnish was common to every

are subject to the jurisdiction of _Mars_. If the Spirit of Iron be
truly known, it hath a secret affinity with the Spirit of _Venus_, so
that both may be conjoined in one, both becoming one only matter, of a
like operation, form, substance and being, healing and expelling the
self-same Diseases, as also to bring the particulars of the Metals into
a change with profit, praise, and excess. But properly _Mars_ must be
observed thus with its virtues, that in his Corporal form he only hath
an earthly Body, which may be used in many things, for to stanch Bloud,
externally in Wounds, to graduate _Luna_, internally to stop or bind the
Body, which yet is not good at all times, and may be used both
internally & externally in mans Body, as likewise in Metallick affairs;

"The History of it is
very well told by _Evagrius_[32], and yet more learnedly by
_Procopius_[33]: and they both observe, that the Distemper had its Birth
in _AEthiopia_ or _Egypt_. THIS is likewise agreeable to the modern Relations of Travellers and
Merchants from _Turkey_, who generally inform us, that the frequent
_Plagues_, which depopulate that Country, are brought thither from the
Coast of _Africa_: insomuch that at _Smyrna_, and other Ports of that
Coast, they often know the very Ship which brings it. And, in these
latter Ages, since our Trade with _Turkey_ has been pretty constant, the
_Plagues_ in these Parts of _Europe_ have evidently been brought from
thence.",1700-1800,32171

"Now that we are convinced
of the Innocence of the Persons who were condemned upon the Credit paid
to this Evidence, we must acknowledge, that human Wisdom could not,
at that Time, have discovered, nay scarce could have suspected it was
false; and that while unsuspected, it had been Injustice not to have
done exactly as was done upon the Trial. We are now reviewing that Account in a very different Light: we have
now been let into the Secret of its Origin; we have seen her since
voluntarily declare, that it was false and forg'd: not in part false,
but in the Whole, and that it was the Off-spring only of her Terrors:
and tho' actuated from the Influence of the same Apprehensions, she
confirmed it at the Trial, she now declares it, freely and voluntarily
declares it, to have been all a Perjury. She has confessed her Motive to the doing this, and that is it was
such an one, as might well have Effect upon an ignorant Creature:
This I shall consider at large when I come presently to treat of her
Informations. She has declared this to have been her only Motive;
and those who are most concerned, do acknowledge, that she was very
unwilling to give it; and was very difficultly brought to it. What
Reason could she have to contradict it?",1700-1800,51334
"Their countenances menaced a general uproar--but I proceeded. Your Lordship read to us, that she had an hope, a presumptuous one: nay,
a punishably-presumptuous one, she calls it; 'that she might be a mean,
in the hand of Providence, to reclaim me; and that this, she knew, if
effected, would give her a merit with you all.' But from what would she
reclaim me?--She had heard, you'll say, (but she had only heard, at the
time she entertained that hope,) that, to express myself in the women's
dialect, I was a very wicked fellow!--Well, and what then?--Why, truly,
the very moment she was convinced, by her own experience, that the charge
against me was more than hearsay; and that, of consequence, I was a fit
subject for her generous endeavours to work upon; she would needs give me
up. Accordingly, she flies out, and declares, that the ceremony which
would repair all shall never take place!--Can this be from any other
motive than female resentment?",1700-1800,11889
"Anyone who
has taken the trouble to observe the nervous and physical condition of
men and women in the average, during even so short a period as the last
quarter of a century, must have been impressed by the marked increase
of neurotic states, not merely in exceptional individuals, but in all
the people. The neurotic temperament is much more adversely affected
by alcohol than any other; and we are all growing more neurotic. All
the conditions of modern life tend that way: and it is not alcohol
alone that will have to go, but all sorts of habit-inducing drugs,
such as morphine, cocaine, and the rest, all of which, like alcohol
itself, will soon be so restricted in regard to their sale that
their abuse will be rendered practically impossible, and their use
restricted to a purely medical employment. It is even quite possible,
and I have already ventured to predict, [30] that when the progress of
neurotism has worked itself out, even such mild exhilarants as tea and
coffee will have to be made the subjects of legal restriction. There
exist many individuals at the present moment upon whom coffee acts
as a stimulant nearly as powerful as alcohol, moderately employed,
upon the rest of us--that is to say, they experience the same mild
exhilaration after a cup of strong coffee as a moderate man does
after a glass of burgundy or a whisky-and-soda.",1900-2000,48674

"Her father was in the battle of Crécy, but returned in safety, and not
long afterwards her little sister Bonne was married to the younger
son of the Duc de Brabant. The Princess Joan, eldest daughter of the
Duc de Normandie, was married on the same day to the elder son of the
Duc de Brabant, by the desire of the King, who wrote orders that his
granddaughter and niece should be ready on a certain day to meet the
two boys who were to be their husbands. The ceremony took place, but
both the boys died a little later of the plague.",1600-1700,50052

further would be my fate, when I was happy to find I fell unhurt upon

  Night is the city's disease. The streets and the people one sees
    Glow with a light that is strangely inhuman;
      A fever that never grows cold. Heaven completes the disgrace;
  For now, with her star-pitted face,
    Night has the leer of a dissolute woman,
      Cynical, moon-scarred and old. And I think of the country roads;
  Of the quiet, sleeping abodes,

"Fit and proper they certainly are, as
the universal consent of all ages and nations shews; and
besides, that fitness and propriety is founded on the nature
of things, but natural and inherent they are not, as is
equally manifest from experience. In ancient Greece, where
the women were remarkable both for continence before
marriage, and fidelity after it, customs prevailed
diametrically opposite to all our most established notions
of modesty and delicacy. It was customary among them, for
the women to perform the offices of rubbers, sweaters, and
cuppers to the men, when bathing; nor was this the
employment of the servants, or female slaves, but of young
ladies of the highest rank and quality. Thus, in the third
Odyssey, when Telemachus is entertained at Nestor's palace,
his youngest daughter,

  _Sweet Polycaste, takes the pleasing toil,_
  _To bathe the prince, and pour the fragrant oil._

How would Clarissa's delicacy have been shock'd and
disgusted, had brother James laid his commands upon her to
rub down Mr. Solmes!",1700-1800,31242
"The greatest
evil is, when the whole literary world has thus also further cause
to complain of their misdeeds, as affecting those who were endowed
with talents of a higher order, such as to make all men interested
in their well-being. It is to be hoped that we are now, under the
benignant reign of Isabel the Second, entitled to expect a more liberal
government, and the advent of a still brighter æra for the literature
of Spain. Taking the space of eighty years, as comprehending the period during
which modern Spanish poetry has been peculiarly distinguished for
superior excellence, we may now make a further division of this period,
into the former and latter parts of it. All the poets, whose lives we
have hitherto traced, wrote their principal works previously to the
year 1810; after which time we have a succession of writers, whose
genius may perhaps be found to take a yet wider range of thought and
feeling, consequent on the extended field of knowledge, which later
events presented to their observation.",1800-1900,53671
"Then
came one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me, and
another gave me half a pint of peas; which was more worth than many
bushels at another time. Then I went to see King Philip. He bade me
come in and sit down, and asked me whether I would smoke it (a usual
compliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners) but this no way suited
me. For though I had formerly used tobacco, yet I had left it ever since
I was first taken. It seems to be a bait the devil lays to make men
lose their precious time.",1600-1700,851

"There were people of education in
the cities and on some of the plantations, but there was no great
educated class from which a literature could proceed. And the culture
of the South, such as it was, was becoming old-fashioned and local, as
the section was isolated more and more from the rest of the Union and
from the enlightened public opinion of Europe by its reactionary
prejudices and its sensitiveness on the subject of slavery. Nothing
can be imagined more ridiculously provincial than the sophomorical
editorials in the Southern press just before the outbreak of the war,

in the poorly supported periodicals of the South.",1600-1700,15854

"Impressive truth, in splendid fiction drest,[55]
  Checks the vain wish, and calms the troubled breast;
  O'er the dark mind a light celestial throws,
  And sooths the angry passions to repose;
  As oil effus'd illumes and smooths the deep,[56]
  When round the bark the foaming surges sweep.--
    But hark, he sings! the strain ev'n Pope admires;
  Indignant Virtue her own bard inspires;
  Sublime as Juvenal, he pours his lays,[57]
  And with the Roman shares congenial praise:--
  In glowing numbers now he fires the age,
  And Shakspeare's sun relumes the clouded stage. [58]
    So full his mind with images was fraught,
  The rapid strains scarce claim'd a second thought;
  And with like ease his vivid lines assume
  The garb and dignity of ancient Rome.--
  Let college _versemen_ trite conceits express,
  Trick'd out in splendid shreds of Virgil's dress;
  From playful Ovid cull the tinsel phrase,
  And vapid notions hitch in pilfer'd lays;
  Then with mosaick art the piece combine,
  And boast the glitter of each dulcet line:
  Johnson adventur'd boldly to transfuse
  His vigorous sense into the Latian muse;
  Aspir'd to shine by unreflected light,
  And with a Roman's ardour _think_ and write. He felt the tuneful Nine his breast inspire,
  And, like a master, wak'd the[59] soothing lyre:
  Horatian strains a grateful heart proclaim,
  While Sky's wild rocks resound his Thralia's name.--
  Hesperia's plant, in some less skillful hands,
  To bloom a while, factitious heat demands;
  Though glowing Maro a faint warmth supplies,
  The sickly blossom in the hot-house dies:
  By Johnson's genial culture, art, and toil,
  Its root strikes deep, and owns the fost'ring soil;
  Imbibes our sun through all its swelling veins,
  And grows a native of Britannia's plains. Soft-ey'd compassion, with a look benign
  His fervent vows he offer'd at thy shrine;
  To guilt, to woe, the sacred debt was paid,[60]
  And helpless females bless'd his pious aid:
  Snatch'd from disease, and want's abandon'd crew,
  Despair and anguish from their victims flew;
  Hope's soothing balm into their bosoms stole,
  And tears of penitence restor'd the soul.",1700-1800,29324

Cook did not continue long, before he quitted it in disgust, and, as

he entered on board the ""Eagle,"" of fifty-four guns, and in a short time
after, Sir Hugh Palliser was appointed to the command of that ship, a
circumstance that must not be passed unnoticed, as it proved the

forward, hat in hand, wished them happiness and went his ways; Ferrati
and Virginia took their places facing the pair, as Egidio still refused
to relinquish his post by Ragna's side--a malicious desire to annoy
Virginia had something to do with this, perhaps--and they drove to
Ferrati's house where luncheon was spread. In spite of all efforts on
the part of Ferrati it was but a half-earted affair, and all felt
relieved when at the close Virginia carried Ragna off to her room to

Jesuit procedure. It is incredible that the Roman authorities should
enjoin the fathers always to settle in wealthy towns, ""because the aim
of our Society is to imitate Christ, our Saviour, who dwelt mainly at

Deccan, but, on the contrary, will render them every assistance in
their power for carrying such intention into execution. Article 2.--The British Government hereby agrees, that in case a
pacification should not be effected between that Government and
Jeswunt Rao Holcar, the British army shall move from its present
encampment, on the banks of the river Beeah, as soon as Jeswunt Rao
Holcar aforesaid shall have marched his army to the distance of thirty

concluded between the British Government and Jeswunt Rao Holcar, it
shall be stipulated that, immediately after the conclusion of the said
treaty, Holcar shall evacuate the territories of the Sikhs, and march

"The present lieutenant governor indeed has other
appointments, but the people are quarrelling with him for it, and will
not suffer him to be easy unless he will retire also. The secretary may have something more than £.200 a year sterling, but
has for the two last years been allowed £.60 lawful money a year less
than had been usual for divers years preceding, tho’ he had convinced
the house by their committee that without this deduction he would have
had no more than £.250 sterling per annum in fees, perquisites and
salary altogether, which is not the one half of his annual expence. The crown did by charter reserve to itself the appointment of a
governor, lieutenant governor and secretary: the design of this was
without doubt to maintain some kind of balance between the powers of
the crown and of the people; but if officers are not in some measure
independent of the people (for it is difficult to serve two masters)
they will sometimes have a hard struggle between duty to the crown and
a regard to self, which must be a very disagreeable situation to them,

"The Effect of the Hand is to confine and raise the fore Parts of the
Horse; the Effect of the Legs is to push and drive forward the hinder
Parts: Now if the fore Parts are kept back or confin'd, and the hinder
Parts are driven forward, the Horse in a quick Motion, such as the
Trot, must of necessity sit down upon his Haunches, and unite and put
himself together. FOR the same Reason making your Horse launch out vigorously in his
Trot, and quickening his Cadence from time to time, putting him to make
Pesades, stopping him and making him go backward, will all contribute
towards his acquiring the Union.--I would define his going off readily,
or all at once, not to be a violent and precipitate Manner of Running,
but only to consist in the Horse's being a little animated, and going
somewhat faster than the ordinary Time of his Pace.--Your Horse trots,
press him a little; in the Instant that he redoubles and quickens his
Action, moderate and shorten, if I may so say, the Hurry of his Pace;
the more then that he presses to go forward, the more will his being
check'd and confin'd tend to unite his Limbs, and the _Union_ will
owe its Birth to opposite Causes; that is to say, on one hand to the
Ardour of the Horse who presses to go forward, and to the Diligence
and Attention of the Horseman on the other, who, by holding him in,
slackens the Pace, and raises the Fore-parts of the Creature, and at
the same time distributes his Strength equally to all his Limbs. The
Action of a Horse, when going backward, is directly opposite to his
abandoning himself upon his Shoulders; by this you compel him to put
himself upon his Haunches: this Lesson is by so much therefore the more
effectual, as that the Cause of a Horse's being dis-united, is often
owing to the Pain he feels in bending his Haunches. THE Pesades have no less Effect, especially upon Horses that are clumsy
and heavy shoulder'd; because they teach them to use them, and to raise
them; and when they raise them up, it follows of necessity that all
their Weight must be thrown upon their Haunches.",1700-1800,46696
"In his stories his
imagination worked on the old lines, but it became conscious of its
working. And the highest note of these stories is not drama, nor
character, but romance. In one of his essays he defines the highest
achievement of romance to be the embodiment of 'character, thought, or
emotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking to the
mind's eye.' His essay on Victor Hugo shows how keenly conscious he was
that narrative romance can catch and embody emotions and effects that are
for ever out of the reach of the drama proper, and of the essay or
homily, just as they are out of the reach of sculpture and painting. Now,
it is precisely in these effects that the chief excellence of romance
resides; it was the discovery of a world of these effects, insusceptible
of treatment by the drama, neglected entirely by the character-novel,
which constituted the Romantic revival of the end of last century.",1900-2000,333

descent of showers, in which a smile and a blessing seemed to have
been steeped. The snow has vanished as if by magic; whatever heaps
may be hidden in the woods and deep gorges of the hills, only two
solitary specks remain in the landscape; and those I shall almost
regret to miss when to-morrow I look for them in vain.",1800-1900,9224
"On the
Western side of this Mountain is a tremendous precipice, over-hanging the
sea, and these rocks are frequented in the summer season by great numbers
of birds of passage; the Gulls occupy the lowest range, above them are
the Razor-bills and Guillemots, over these croak the Corvorants, and the
Herons possess the uppermost projections and ledges of this stupendous
rock; the Peregrine Falcon also builds his nest in these impending crags. In the days of Falconry these birds were considered so excellent, that
the great minister BURLEIGH, sent a letter of thanks to an ancestor of
Sir Thomas MOSTYN’S, for a present of a cast of Hawks from this place. The British name of this hill, _Gogarth_, seems to be derived from ogo,
or gogo, a Cave, and Garth, a Promontory, for there are several caves
under this rock, and particularly one very large, inaccessible except by
water; not far from it are the ruins of an old Palace, belonging to the
Bishops of Bangor; there is also a farm house near the spot, known by the
above name, Gogarth.",1800-1900,45865

"In order to observe the direction of this star at its
lowest point, the builders excavated in the solid rock a tunnel about
4 feet in diameter, so as to keep this star visible each day at the
lowest point of its circuit. This tunnel extended 350 feet through the
rock to a point nearly under the centre of the pyramid, where, by a
small vertical boring, a plumb-line could have been dropped so as to
obtain the exact line of the meridian on the surface, and afterwards
on each successive step of the pyramid as it was built up. While the
building went on the sloping tunnel was continued backwards to its
northern face; and a tunnel ascending to the south was formed of the
same size and making the same angle with the horizon. This had puzzled
all previous explorers of the pyramid till Mr. Proctor showed that, by
stopping up the downward passage at the angle and filling the hollow
with water the pole star could be observed by reflexion and thus give
the exact direction of the meridian on the upper surface of the pyramid
with extreme accuracy, as it was built up slowly year by year. But at a distance of 127 feet a new feature appears.",1900-2000,50289

mystic worship of foreign deities the satisfaction of their religious
yearnings which the Roman state religion did not give. He seems to have
been opposed to Christianity, though he nowhere mentions it directly. His great reputation and the number of works ascribed to him would seem

waltz, tripping the light fantastic toe or stubbing it, as the case may
be. But that was in the days of the old-fashioned square dance, which
was the fat man's friend among dances, and also of the old-fashioned
two-step, and not in these times when dancing is a cross between a
wrestling match, a contortion act and a trip on a roller-coaster, and is

prowling about the streets for some promising individual whom he might
seduce into the house, and for some days he followed this occupation, but
his efforts failed, and the report at night only again inflamed the desire
of the morning. One afternoon, it was in December 1827, he again betook
himself to the street, and for hours dodged about searching among the poor

facilities to a beginner which were afterwards held of small account when
practice gave proficiency and success confidence. At last he observed in

The tolerably long drawn-out concluding rondo is lively and brilliant,
and far from insignificant, though not equal to the first movement in
force and fire. A second symphony was written by Mozart in great haste on his journey
through Linz in November, 1783; it was apparently that in C major (part
6, 425 K.), which with another short symphony in G major (part 6, 444
K.), bears clear traces of Haydn's influence, direct and indirect. (Note: By M. Haydn--the Introduction only by Mozart. DW)

Several years lie between these symphonies and the next in D major (part
1, 504 K.). This was written for the winter concerts on December 6,
1786, and met with extraordinary approbation, especially in Prague,
where Mozart performed it in January, 1787[44]The first glance at the
symphony shows an altered treatment of the orchestra; it is now
fully organised, and both in combination and detail shows individual
independence.",1700-1800,43413
"It is as if
the soul, fully aroused, became aware by its own light of the oppression
and injustice abroad upon the earth. But there is a more vague and general disaffection to the world than is
the outcome of any particular experience. It may be called a spiritual
discontent which few have felt as a passion, but many have known as a
mood: when that average goodness of human nature which we have found so
companionable, and to which we have so pleasantly adapted ourselves,
becomes ""very tolerable and not to be endured;"" when the world seems to
be made of our vices, and our virtues seem to be looking on, or if they
enter into the fray are too tame and conventional for the selfish fire
and unscrupulous industry of their rivals; and when to our excited
sensibility there is a taint in the moral atmosphere, and we long to
escape if only to breathe more freely. This is more than a mood with
Shakespeare, and is present in those slight but distinctive touches that
mark the unconscious intrusion of character in an artist's work; and is
frankly confessed in one of his Sonnets:---

   ""Tired with all these; for restful death I cry;
   As to behold desert a beggar born,

a turn in the road. He easily selected the planter's residence in
a large square building with two wings, with numerous good-sized,
well-lighted windows, and broad verandas running around its full

far-reaching rays of the lamps within. A noble grove surrounded it,

says how Mrs. Griffin, our housekeeper's wife, hath it from his maid, that

infinite charge since his coming thither in alterations, and particularly
that Mr. Harper at Deptford did himself tell her that my Lord hath had of
Foly, the ironmonger, L50 worth in locks and keys for his house, and that
it is from the fineness of them, having some of L4 and L5 a lock, such as
is in the Duke's closet; that he hath several of these; that he do keep
many of her things from her of her own goods, and would have her bring a
bill into the office for them; that Mrs. Griffin do say that he do not
keep Mrs. Williams now for love, but need, he having another whore that he
keeps in Covent Garden; that they do owe money everywhere almost for every
thing, even Mrs. Shipman for her butter and cheese about L3, and after
many demands cannot get it. Mrs. Turner says she do believe their coming

as privateers, no purchase, no pay.",1600-1700,4176

books in England during the sixteenth century, the start given to the
Continental presses was too great, and before our printers had fully
caught up their competitors, they too were seized with the carelessness
and almost incredible bad taste which marks the books of the first half
of the seventeenth century in every country of Europe. Towards the close of the eighteenth century, as is well known, the
French thought sufficiently well of Baskerville's types to purchase a
fount after his death for the printing of an important edition of the
works of Voltaire. But the merits of Baskerville as a printer, never

LUCIUS APULEIUS African, an excellent follower of Plato his sect, born
in Madaura, a Countrey sometime inhabited by the Romans, and under the
jurisdiction of Syphax, scituate and lying on the borders of Numidia and
Getulia, whereby he calleth himself half a Numidian and half a Getulian:
and Sidonius named him the Platonian Madaurence: his father called
Theseus had passed all offices of dignity in his countrey with much
honour.",1600-1700,1666
"The children walked onward, beguiling the way with merry talk; they had
soon passed the familiar scenes which lay between them and the next
village, and thenceforth it was wholly a land of new discovery. ""But,
look, that little brook runs along a good deal merrier than our slow
Steinbach at home!"" ""Just look there, on the hillside lies a churchyard, with nothing but
white crosses!""",1700-1800,43245
"There were questions
enough however within the limits of safe discussion, to set agoing
those unending controversies which distinguished Protestantism to this
day. The newly acquired privilege of discussing sacred affairs among
laymen as well as others, were indulged in to such an extent that
debate between the sects, in defense of their several interpretations
of scriptural texts, monopolized in society its hours of intercourse
and conversation. When their leaders were indulging in such discussion
as the dialogue between Eve and the Serpent; whether the Serpent stood
erect on his tail, or in its natural coil when it was addressing Eve;
fixing the hour of this remarkable event; accounting for the manner
in which Noah fed the animals in the ark; how fishes appeared before
Adam to be named by him, and such troublesome problems, laymen were
mostly engaged in the examination of those doctrinal points which were
dividing the movement into sects. Questions that had been settled
centuries before by authority in the old church were dragged forth
to renewed discussion.",1800-1900,56979
"Whereas We (by the advice of Our Commissioners for Our Revenue) have
resolved to import a quantity of Spanish Tobacco (not exceeding
fifty thousand weight in any one yeere) and utterly to prohibite the
importation of any other forreine Tobacco, which is not of the growth
of Our owne Plantations, and to prohibite also the planting of all
Tobacco within these Our Realmes of England and Ireland, and Islands
thereto belonging or adjacent, As by Our Proclamation, dated the
seventeenth day of February last (for the reasons therein expressed)
it doth at large appeare: Now, because Wee are informed, that it will
much conduce to Our Service, and the setling of that businesse, for the
preventing of the stealing in of all forreine Tobacco, and discovery
of the offendours, and for the clearing of all others, who are not
offendors, from future trouble, that all the Tobacco of the growth of
Our plantations already imported, shal be sealed by Our Commissioners
to that purpose appointed, aswell as that which shal be hereafter
imported, in such sort as by our sayd Proclamation is already directed,
That so the Tobacco of Our Plantations may bee distinguished from the
forreine Tobacco, and the Tobacco planted within these Our Realmes,
which are prohibited: Our will and command therfore is, and We doe
hereby declare et publish Our Royall pleasure to be, That Our said
Commissioners appointed by Us for this Service, shal with al covenient
speed, Seale all the Tobacco of the growth of Our said Plantations
already imported in such sort, as they are directed to Seale that which
shall be hereafter imported. And if any person whatsoever, having any such Tobacco, of the growth
of Our said Plantations, or any of them, which shall refuse to have
the same Sealed, or which shall not offer the same to be Sealed, as
aforesayd, and the same shall hereafter, at any time after one moneth,
from the date hereof, be discovered, that the same shall bee taken and
reputed for forreine Tobacco, or for Tobacco of the growth of these Our
Realmes, which hath been prohibited, and which they durst not avow the
keeping of, and as such Prohibited Tobacco shal be taken, and seized as
other prohibited Tobacco, according to the Tenor and true meaning of
Our said former Proclamation, whereof Wee will, that every person, whom
it may concerne, do take notice at their perill. Given at Our Court at White-Hall, the thirtieth day of March, in the

"At noon home to dinner, and so to the
office again all the afternoon, and did a great deal of business, and so
home to supper and to bed, with my mind at pretty good ease, having this
day presented to the Board the Duke of York's letter, which, I perceive,
troubled Sir W. Pen, he declaring himself meant in that part, that
concerned excuse by sickness; but I do not care, but am mightily glad that
it is done, and now I shall begin to be at pretty good ease in the Office. This morning, to my great content, W. Hewer tells me that a porter is
come, who found my tally in Holborne, and brings it him, for which he
gives him 20s. 29th (Lord's day). Lay long in bed with pleasure with my wife, with whom
I have now a great deal of content, and my mind is in other things also
mightily more at ease, and I do mind my business better than ever and am
more at peace, and trust in God I shall ever be so, though I cannot yet
get my mind off from thinking now and then of Deb., but I do ever since my
promise a while since to my wife pray to God by myself in my chamber every
night, and will endeavour to get my wife to do the like with me ere long,
but am in much fear of what she lately frighted me with about her being a
Catholique; and I dare not, therefore, move her to go to church, for fear
she should deny me; but this morning, of her own accord, she spoke of
going to church the next Sunday, which pleases me mightily.",1600-1700,4193
"It is not easy at this remote period to appreciate the difficulties of
the position in which Hull eventually found himself. At first he
refused to take command of the expedition, but being urged by the
government, accepted, though with the express understanding that in
case of hostilities, he was to be sustained both by a fleet on Lake
Erie, and an army operating on the northern and western frontier of
New York. He knew that the conquest of Canadian territory would be of
slight importance, if the lake and river communication was controlled
by the enemy, for they could pass their troops from one point to
another with great rapidity, cut off his supplies and reinforcements,
and hem him in till a force sufficient to overwhelm him was
concentrated. On arriving near Malden, he was astounded to hear that the enemy had
received notice of the war before him, and hence had time to make more
or less preparations.",1800-1900,39368

"As soon as the preacher distinguished Mr. Bloundel, he addressed his
discourse to him; and, alluding to his religious habits and general
excellence of character, held him up as an example to others. The grocer
would fain have retreated; but the preacher besought him to stay, and
was proceeding in the same strain, when a sudden interruption took
place. A slight disturbance occurring amid the crowd, the attendant
attempted to check it, and in doing so received a sound buffet on the
ears. In endeavouring to return the blow, he struck another party, who
instantly retaliated, and a general affray commenced--some taking one
side, some the other.",1600-1700,11082
"It ""covereth"" all things, studiously 
conniving at real defects, and concealing assured miscarriages:  how 
much more not divulging imaginary or false scandals! It disposeth 
to seek and further any the least good concerning him:  how much 
more will it hinder committing grievous outrage upon his dearest 
good name! Again, all injustice is abominable; to do any sort of wrong is a 
heinous crime; that crime which of all most immediately tendeth to 
the dissolution of society, and disturbance of human life; which God 
therefore doth most loathe, and men have reason especially to 
detest.",1700-1800,10274

beside it. But you shall not die, even if you are ill now.' He immediately summoned all the best doctors in the country, and they
came with all their prescriptions and their medicine bottles, but next

"Sixthly, It is now the general custom to send every sick person on
shore to an hospital, where there is frequently worse air and worse
accommodation than on board, from overcrowding the apartments. Contagious diseases, though not so common as in Europe, are here
often mixed with those that are not so, whereby numbers are infected
and carried off; and, besides this, the land air is infinitely more
unwholesome in the West Indies than the air at sea or in a road. The
scurvy is perhaps not at all contagious, nor is it very difficult of
cure; but a number of cases of it terminate fatally from the flux
or fever, caught either by contagion in hospitals, by the noxious
influence of land vapours, or by intemperance. I beg leave, therefore,
humbly to suggest, that as few sick as possible of any disease, but
what is contagious, be sent to hospitals, and that some method be
established for the supply of vegetables and other refreshments to the
sick on board of their ships. Seventhly, Crowding, filth, and the mixture of diseases, are the great
causes of mortality in hospitals.",1700-1800,53007
"The reflection that the Duke of Newcastle’s careful work came somewhat

they emitted any light from the stateroom; but none was visible. I then
forced the penblade of my knife through them, until I met with some
hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to be a solid mass
of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed the blade along
it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The only course now left me was to
retrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or
try so to tranquillize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of
escape.",1800-1900,51060
"He ordered me to be gone,

about one thousand ducados), he would kill me. I left his presence,
with the bad treatment that I have described, and went to my lodgings
as best as I could, where I found an order from the inspector not to
receive me. I knew not where to go, for all fled from me, being fearful
lest some blow should come upon them by reason of me.",1600-1700,42399

"For this
purpose new light must be thrown on the Order. Now, there was probably
no one better qualified than Voltaire, with his knowledge of the ancient
and medieval world and hatred of the Catholic Church, to undertake the
construction of a historical romance subversive of the Catholic
faith--hence the urgent summons to the philosopher to visit Frederick. We can imagine Voltaire delving amongst the records of the past in order
to reconstruct the Templar heresy. This was clearly Gnostic, and the
Mandaeans or Christians of St. John may well have appeared to present the
required characteristics. If it could be shown that here in Johannism
true ""primitive Christianity"" was to be found, what a blow for the

sunk, on the first entrance of the French, a very considerable sum in
assignats; they made large contributions in specifics, and they pay,
feed, and clothe an army estimated, as I am informed, at near three
times its real number. It is supposed that France has by various means
drawn from Holland about 60,000,000 of dollars. This has been paid, in
addition to the natural expenditures, by a population of less than

make the whole matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who
had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded
him, urging him to return and console his father at once and without a
moment's delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until
he had concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were
at stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would
not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he

reproach; they are seated on high, that we may only look up to them 
with respect; their defects are not to be seen, or not to be touched 
by malicious or wanton wits, by spiteful or scornful tongues:  the 
diminution of their credit is a public mischief, and the State 
itself doth suffer in their becoming objects of scorn; not only 
themselves are vilified and degraded, but the great affairs they 
manage are obstructed, the justice they administer is disparaged 
thereby. In fine, no jesting is allowable which is not thoroughly innocent:  
it is an unworthy perverting of wit to employ it in biting and 
scratching; in working prejudice to any man's reputation or 
interest; in needlessly incensing any man's anger or sorrow; in 
raising animosities, dissensions, and feuds among any. Whence it is somewhat strange that any men from so mean and silly a 
practice should expect commendation, or that any should afford 
regard thereto; the which it is so far from meriting, that indeed 
contempt and abhorrence are due to it. Men do truly more render 
themselves despicable than others when, without just ground, or 
reasonable occasion, they do attack others in this way.",1700-1800,10274

philosophic justification for any such idea, is a matter on which I
will not now express an opinion; but, at any rate, as it stands, it is
not science, and its formulation gives no sort of conception of what
life and will and consciousness really are. Even if it were true, it contains nothing whatever in the nature of
explanation: it recognises the inexplicable, and relegates it to the
atoms, where it seems to hope that further quest may cease. Instead of
tackling the difficulty where it actually occurs; instead of
associating life, will, and consciousness with the organisms in which
they are actually in experience found, these ideas are foisted into the
atoms of matter; and then the properties which have been conferred on
the atoms are denied in all essential reality to the fully developed
organisms which those atoms help to compose!",1900-2000,26321

that it would cause less damage if it remained in the Indias (and
even some extend this idea to its being lost in the sea); because,
under the pretext of its coming concealed, it either does not come
into Sevilla, or, if it does come in, soon goes out again. In both
these cases, it remains in the hands of the French, English, Flemish,

tremendous moment is alone—however vast the crowd—alone against the
universe, and this universe has turned into a darkness that can be felt;
felt as a torment of body as well as a shattering of the spirit. When I looked upon the myth of Psyche in the Villa Farnesina at Rome as
designed by Raphael, it was borne in on me how the primitive Greek,

"On the fifth day after
my arrival in Somerset East a detachment consisting of two companies of
infantry, accompanied by baggage and ammunition wagons, under the
command of a Captain Fletcher, arrived from Port Elizabeth, and encamped
within half a mile of the town in an excellent strategic position, which
they at once proceeded to entrench strongly; and there they remained
nearly a week, awaiting instructions from their general, who was
preparing a plan of campaign while moving toward the centre of
disturbance the few troops at his disposal, and collecting information. During the week that followed the arrival of the troops we received
intelligence of several attacks upon isolated farms, and even small
villages, in the outlying and more sparsely populated districts; from
which it speedily became apparent that the regular troops, consisting,
as they did, entirely of infantry, and hampered, as they were, by their
baggage wagons, were altogether too slow-moving to be effective in
overtaking and bringing to action the nimble bodies of savages, who were
encumbered with no impedimenta of any description whatsoever excepting
their weapons--a shield, knobkerrie, and sheaf of assagais; who slept
under the stars, quenched their thirst at every stream or runlet that
crossed their path, and eat whatever came to hand, whether it chanced to
be buck, bullock, or green mealies. Therefore it seemed, upon careful consideration of the situation, that
if the ravages of the blacks were to be stopped there was only one
course to be pursued, and that was to dispatch against them a force of
irregular cavalry composed of farmers, hunters, transport riders, and
others, men who had lived long enough in the country to become inured to
the climate and accustomed to the methods of travel in it, who could
move as independently of impedimenta as the savages themselves, and,
being mounted, as swiftly, and who, being provided with firearms, might
hope to cope successfully with a foe considerably stronger in point of
numbers than themselves. And there were plenty of such men to be had--
farmers who had fled from their farms to the towns and villages upon the
first news of the outbreak, transport riders whose occupation had ceased
upon the outbreak of hostilities, hunters who were in like case with the
transport riders, and a few who, like myself, had lost everything but
life itself at the hands of the savages; and we speedily banded
ourselves into troops, in some cases numbering not more than twenty or
thirty, in others amounting to a hundred or more, each band under its
own elected leader and subordinate officers. The corps to which I
attached myself--and which dubbed itself the Somerset East Mounted
Rifles--consisted of one hundred and seven men under the command of
Major Henderson, divided into two troops of fifty men each--the right
troop under the command of ""Captain"" Henry Jackson, and the left troop

gratified. And if this Expedition of _de Fonte_ was remembered, and the
Papers relating thereto could be brought to light, it might immediately
encourage us to proceed on making a further Attempt for the Discovery
of a North-west Passage, therefore we can have no Reason to expect the
Court of _Spain_ would assist us with what might determine us to a
Proceeding at which they must take Umbrage, as we are now become the

"However, he
was prevailed upon to abstain from such immediate vengeance, as a step
unworthy of his character; and the affair was brought to this issue,
that his lordship should either part with me or Mr. H--; for I was fully
determined against living under the same roof with such an incendiary. ""This alternative being proposed, my lord dismissed his steward, and we
returned to town with the doctor and Mrs. S--; for I had imbibed such
horror and aversion for this country seat, though one of the pleasantest
in England, that I could not bear to live in it. We therefore removed to
a house in Bond-street, where, according to the advice of my friends, I
exerted my whole power and complaisance in endeavours to keep my husband
in good-humour, but was so unsuccessful in my attempts, that, if ever he
was worse tempered, more capricious, or intolerable, at one time than at
another, this was the season in which his ill-humour predominated in the
most rancorous degree. I was scarce ever permitted to stir abroad, saw
nobody at home, but my old male friend, whom I have mentioned above; and
the doctor, with his lady, from whose conversation, also, I was at last
excluded. ""Nevertheless, I contrived to steal a meeting now and then with my late

their writer."" Very slowly, with a feeling of genuine grief and shame for the man who
seemed incapable of either sorrow or shame, Major Lane held out the
folded paper; and then in very pity he looked away as his old friend's
son eagerly unrolled the piece of foolscap, placing it close under the
lamp-shade in order that he might thoroughly master its contents. As Theodore Carden completed the trifling action, that of unrolling the
piece of paper which was to solve the mystery, he noted, with a curious
feeling of relief, that the documents (or were they letters?) regarded
by the Head Constable as so damnatory, were but two, the first of some

"Pepys was Clerk of the Acts from 1660 to 1672, that is, during the
whole period of the “Diary,” and three years afterwards. He was
succeeded by his clerk, Thomas Hayter, and his brother John Pepys, who
held the office jointly. As already stated, Pepys was promoted to be
Secretary of the Admiralty in 1672, and continued in office until 1679,
when he was again succeeded for a time by Hayter. We know comparatively
little of him in the higher office, and it is as Clerk of the Acts that
he is familiar to us. With regard to this position it is necessary to
bear in mind that the “so-called” clerk, as well as being secretary,
was also a member of the Board, and one of the “principal officers.”
On one occasion Pepys met Sir G. Carteret, Sir J. Minnes, and Sir W.
Batten at Whitehall, and when the King spied them out, he cried, “Here
is the Navy Office!”[211]

"If the Hostess, or her Daughters
company were desired, he would be the forwardest to call them, and only
treat and converse with them as of some small acquaintance; after
supper, he would endeavour to draw on the Company to drink high, and use
all possible means to enflame the reckoning; and when he saw they were
well heated with wine, and the fury of their expences was over, he would
pretend, out of good Husbandry, to call for a Reckoning before they went
to bed, that they might not be mis-reckoned, or staid from the pursuit
of their Journey in the Morning; to this they would commonly agree, and
the Sum total of the reckoning being cast up, he would be the first man
that would, without scruple, or inquiry into the particulars, lay down
his share, and by his examples, the rest would follow; if any did
question the dearness of the Victuals, or the quantity of the drink, he
would by one means or other take them off, protesting that the Hostess
was too honest to mis-reckon them, and that he had kept a just account
himself, and was well satisfied; or else he should be as cautious from
parting from his money as any of them; and then they, not distrusting
him further, would by his example pay the shot. Thus would he many
times, by his Crown or six shillings share, mis-reckon on them sixteen
or twenty shillings; especially if they came to high drinking: and then
the reckoning being paid, they went to bed, he retiring with his wife,
and he would lye abed in the morning, and let them march off alone; but
if they, in the Morning, did fall to drinking again, taking a hair of
the Old Dog, then would he up, and at them again, make one at that
sport, and many times put them out of capacity to Travel that day, and
so keep them there to his profit, and their expences; he shifting his
Liquor, and in the end, shifting himself out of their Companies, when he
has seen his Conveniency, leaveing them to pay roundly for their folly. If they enquired after him, my Hostess would pretend he was a Chance
Guest, as they were, only, she had seen him the last year, or such like;
and thus he would force a Trade, and enjoy his pleasure and profit, by
joyning them together; and this course did he frequently use when Guests
came not in of their own accord; so that our house was seldome empty. As mine Host, who was the Head and Chief of the House, had his tricks,
so had the rest of the Family theirs, even the least in the House; for
there was an unhappy boy, who was sometimes with the maid in the
Kitchin, sometimes with the Tapster, attending Guests in their lodgings,
and other times, with the Hostler and Horses in the Stable; this boy,
though he was little was witty; and seeing that every one had their
tricks, he cast about how he might have his, and have some profit in the
Adventure; so that one day, mine Host being abroad, and the Tapster out
of the way, he drew the drink; and not only the Beer, but carried
bottles of wine to the Guests, & seeing them in a merry vain, he thought
to try his skill at mis-reckoning them; and for six bottles which he
carried into them when they came to pay, he reckoned them eight; and
though there was some questioning of the truth, yet he justified it, and
stood to it, that he had the reckoning he demanded.",1600-1700,52494

"Late copies of Telegraph and Telephone Age, brought to the planet Mars

felicitous telegrams at the Cleveland meeting from terrestrial friends,
I hope it will not be amiss for us to extend our congratulations to
that honorable body and I suggest that a committee of the Cleveland Old
Timers now here assembled be appointed to draft a suitable and loving
message for our friends to be read on the occasion of the 1917 reunion.”

Thus spoke E. P. Wright, and cheer after cheer greeted his suggestion
and Gen. Anson Stager, Jeptha H. Wade, Frank G. Beach and Thomas
Callahan were appointed such committee, which showed the democratic
spirit of the assemblage. “I believe that I will send a private wireless message to my old
friend, Allen A. Briggs, and tell him what a nice place it is up here,”
said Hank Stager, and many others fell into line to do the same stunt. Presidents Garfield and McKinley, both members of the Ohio Society,
stopped to read the bulletins and to shake hands with Nelson Buell,
whom the late presidents remembered particularly well for his
ever-gentle courtesy when they met in the telegraph office. “We will watch with keen interest the occurrences at the next Old

our hearty congratulations to our worthy brothers in session.” This
seemed to be the consensus of opinion, heartily expressed, which was
handed to Mr. Moxon, with the remark, “More to come.”

intelligible in history; so that when He comes he will find his servants
watching; looking up and lifting up their heads; waiting patiently, yet
longing ardently; and ready to welcome their reigning King with the words

"But the war now raged in Europe and the East Indies, and
engaged the attention of both nations in those quarters. It was not until the campaign in 1758, that affairs assumed a more
favorable aspect in America. But upon a change of administration, Mr.
Pitt was appointed Prime Minister, and the operations of war became more
vigorous and successful. General Amherst was sent to take possession of
Cape Breton; and after a warm siege, the garrison of Louisburgh
surrendered by capitulation. General Forbes was successful in taking
possession of fort Du Quesne, which the French thought fit to abandon.",1700-1800,44416

"It must be recognised as an
indispensable element of culture, and it must be shown, which is
unfortunately more difficult, that it is actually subserving this end,
not only for a few persons here and there, but for a considerable
proportion of the population. I am not opposing the admission of fiction
into public libraries, but it is evident that if fiction constitutes the
larger portion of the literature in request, the average ratepayer will
not think, nor ought he to think, that any case has been made out for
his inserting his hands more deeply into his pockets. I am quite aware,
of course, that librarians individually can do but little in this
direction. Whatever can be done should be done, for the entire case of
the librarian in claiming respect from the community and the material
advantages concatenated therewith is that he is, in however humble a
measure, a priest of literature and science; as truly, though not as
ostensibly, a public instructor as if he occupied the chair of a
professor. Let him endeavour to live up to this character, and in
proportion as the community itself becomes conscious of its shortcomings
and its needs, the librarian's estimation will rise and his position
improve.",1800-1900,53163

The great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed. For her, Toboso's queen, from side to side

On Rocinante oft a weary ride. Malignant planets, cruel destiny,

Of death; he paid love's bitter penalty,

"Why is Peireskius, or any man else, to be
abused for an appetite for that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge:
For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question, continued
he, the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head; and tho'
I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchieved
it;--yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones,
be they what they will, or it could not have answered at the rate my
brother mentions. It answered, replied my uncle Toby, as well, if not better; for, as
Peireskius elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its
motion, Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus; which, unless I have forgot my
Latin, is, that it was as swift as the wind itself. But pray, Dr. Slop, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not
without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what principles was
this self-same chariot set a-going?--Upon very pretty principles to
be sure, replied Dr. Slop:--And I have often wondered, continued he,
evading the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large
plains like this of ours,--(especially they whose wives are not past
child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only
be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is
subject,--if the wind only served,--but would be excellent good
husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost nothing, and which eat
nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take 'em) both cost and
eat a great deal. For that very reason, replied my father, 'Because they cost nothing, and
because they eat nothing,'--the scheme is bad;--it is the consumption of
our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to
the hungry, circulates trade,--brings in money, and supports the value
of our lands;--and tho', I own, if I was a Prince, I would
generously recompense the scientifick head which brought forth such
contrivances;--yet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them.",1700-1800,1079

Parliament, when highway robbers cloaked their villainies with Royalist
partisanship, to the less romantic eighteenth century, and finally
ended, early in the nineteenth century, with all the glamour and
tinselled things of the past, in squalid, commonplace circumstances. The highwaymen begin in the dimness of antiquity, continue very largely
as heroic myths throughout the middle ages, become philanthropic and
