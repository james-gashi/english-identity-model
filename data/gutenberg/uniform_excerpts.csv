the other three, the effect was most striking.' It was drawn towards
the axis when the magnet was excited, the tube containing the rarer gas
being apparently driven away, and the greater the difference between the
densities of the two gases, the greater was the energy of this action. And now observe his mode of reaching a material magnetic zero. When

"_Of the sixth Ward, and the remaining ancient Buildings of the second
  Hill._


It had been very difficult to have discover’d, either from the
Situation of the _Forum_ of _Constantine_, or the Pillar of
_Constantine_ still standing at _Constantinople_, or the _Description
of the Wards_ (although it takes Notice of the Pillar of _Constantine_,
and tells us, that the sixth Ward enters upon a short Plain, and
that ’tis afterwards lengthen’d by a long Descent) whether the sixth
_Ward_ had been on the North or the South Side of the City, unless the
Author had added, that it reach’d from the _Forum_ of _Constantine_
down to Stairs from whence you sail over the _Sycæne_ Ferry. It was
originally call’d the _Sycæne_ Ferry from _Syca_, but is now call’d
_Galata_, or _Pera_, as will appear more fully, when I come to speak
of it in the thirteenth _Ward_. That the fifth and sixth _Wards_
join’d together, I observ’d before from the Vicinity of the Dock, the
Stairs of _Chalcedon_, the _Sycæne_ Stairs, and the _Bosphorian_ Port
to each other. Having therefore discover’d the Situation of _Syca_,
I take it for granted, that the Dock stood near a Plain on the Sea
Shore, which was below the Foot of the second Hill, and that the Ferry
Place from whence you passed over to _Syca_, is the same with that
from whence you sail at present to _Galata_, and that the _Porphyry_
Pillar now standing, is the same with that mention’d by the Author of
the _Description_, &c. and placed by him in the sixth _Ward_; though
he takes no Notice in his Description of the sixth _Ward_, where he
places the Senate-House, how near it stood to the _Forum_ or Pillar
of _Constantine_. But I shall make it plain to the Reader from other
Historians, in what follows, that the Senate-House stood on the North
Side of the _Forum_ of _Constantine_, and that this _Ward_ stood
partly on the Ridge of the second Hill, where the _Porphyry_ Pillar
is now standing, as is also the Poultry Market, which the _Turks_
call _Taubasor_, or _Taouck Baser_, the Dyers Shops, the House of
_Ænobarbus_, a _Turkish_ Admiral, and the Mosque of _Hali-Bassa_.",53083,1400s

why you should not attend to it; on the contrary, it will distinguish you

in that very article, in which men excel brutes; SPEECH. Constant experience has shown me, that great purity and elegance of
style, with a graceful elocution, cover a multitude of faults, in either
a speaker or a writer. For my own part, I confess (and I believe most
people are of my mind) that if a speaker should ungracefully mutter or
stammer out to me the sense of an angel, deformed by barbarism and
solecisms, or larded with vulgarisms, he should never speak to me a
second time, if I could help it. Gain the heart, or you gain nothing; the

the fate which awaits him. Fausta surrenders herself to her grief--loss of

"What I mean by gaining of Ground, is the increasing of the Earth’s
Surface: For if a flat Piece be plow’d up into Ridges, and if in each
Sixteen Feet Breadth there be an empty Furrow of Two Feet; and yet,
by the Height and Roundness of the Ridges, they have Eighteen Feet of
Surface capable of producing Corn, equally to Eighteen Feet whilst the
Piece was flat; there will be one Eighth Part of profitable Ground or
Surface gain’d, more than it had when level; and this, I believe,
Experience will prove, if the thing were well examined into. But against this Increase of profitable Ground, there is an Objection,
which I must not call a frivolous one, in respect to the Authors who
bring it; yet, I hope, the Desire of finding the Truth will justify me
to examine it; and the Arguments brought to sustain it. This Opinion of theirs is founded upon their Notion (which I think very
erroneous) of the perpendicular Growth of Vegetables; and is, by Mr.
_Bradley_, set in its best Light, in his _Vol._ I. _Pag._ 8. _usque ad

such an effect upon me, that, from being chearful and brisk, I
began to be peevish and melancholy, so that nothing could please
me; and was constantly so strangely disposed, that I neither knew
what to say to others, nor what to do with myself. On the twelfth

me twenty-two hours, and was succeeded by a terrible fever, which
continued thirty-five days and as many nights, without giving me

I could not, during the whole time, sleep half a quarter of an

"[Sidenote: _The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy first formed._]

It was in the Pontificate of _Sylvester_, and under the benign Auspices
of _Constantine_, that the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy was first formed and
settled in the Manner it continues to this Day; the new Form of
Government, introduced by that Prince into the State, serving as a Model
for the Government of the Church. In the Three first Centuries no other
Hierarchy was known, no other Degrees thought of, but those of Bishops,
Presbyters, and Deacons. Of these alone was composed the whole Body of
the Clergy; but with this Difference, that the Bishop or Supervisor was
the general Disposer and Manager of all Things within the Bounds of his
Jurisdiction, nothing being done there without his Consent and
Approbation, and the Presbyters and Deacons his Assistants, or his
Counsellors and Senate, as St. _Jerom_[588], and before him St.
_Ignatius_[589], styled them. This Order was probably introduced,
according to _Grotius_[590], in Imitation of the _Jewish_ Synagogues;
for each Synagogue had its Ruler, who presided over the rest, its
Pastors, and its Eleemosynaries; to the Ruler succeeded the Bishop, to
the Pastors the Presbyters, and to the Eleemosynaries the Deacons. [Sidenote: _The Office and Duty of Bishops._] It was the Bishop’s Office
and Duty to preach the Word[591], to pray with his People[592] to
administer the Sacraments[593], to ordain Ministers[594], to
excommunicate Offenders[595], to absolve Penitents[596], and to regulate
and settle every thing relating to his particular Church[597], with the
Consent and Concurrence of the Presbytery; for the Presbyters were his
Counsellors or Senate, and, together with him, presided in the
Consistories of those Times, as we learn from _Tertullian_ telling us,

      capital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greatest support
      to domestic industry, and to give revenue and employment to the greatest
      number of people of his own country. Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of
      domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that
      its produce may be of the greatest possible value. The produce of industry is what it adds to the subject or materials upon
      which it is employed. In proportion as the value of this produce is great
      or small, so will likewise be the profits of the employer. But it is only
      for the sake of profit that any man employs a capital in the support of
      industry; and he will always, therefore, endeavour to employ it in the
      support of that industry of which the produce is likely to be of the
      greatest value, or to exchange for the greatest quantity either of money

that makes it _infectious_; and then, by what Means it communicates its
noxious Quality to other Bodies. The ancientest and best Authors of Physick, who lived in a Country more
exposed to these Calamities than ours, observed the Constitution of the
_Air_, which preceded _Pestilential Fevers_, to be great _Heats_
attended with much _Rain_ and _Southerly Winds_[1]: And one of Them
takes particular Notice, that no other than a _moist_ and _hot_
Temperament of the _Air_ brings the _Plague_; and that the Duration of
this Constitution is the Measure of the Violence of the Distemper[2]. The Natural History of several Countries confirms this Observation; in
_Africa_ particularly, if Showers fall during the sultry Heats of _July_
and _August_, the _Plague_ ensues thereupon, with which whosoever is
infected hardly escapes[3]. It has besides been remarked in all Times, that the Stinks of
_stagnating Waters_ in hot Weather, _putrid Exhalations_ from the Earth;
and above all, the Corruption of dead _Carcasses_ lying unburied, have
occasioned _infectious Diseases_.",54843,1600s

endeavour to find out the _Noblesse_ in their retreats. In the morning, however, before we could leave the ship, several canoes
came about us, most of them from the westward, and two of them were
filled with people, who by their dress and deportment appeared to be of
a superior rank: two of these came on board, and each singled out his
friend; one of them, whose name we found to be _Matahah_, fixed upon Mr
Banks, and the other upon me: this ceremony consisted in taking off

reluctance to change her maiden state, and lose her maiden freedom,
which had in his eyes all the attractions of youthful shamefaced-ness. That she would eventually be his own dear wife, James entertained
no manner of doubt; and, pleased with all that pleased her, was not
unwilling to prolong the happy days of courtship. In this humour Lucy had left him, when, towards the end of May, she
had gone for the first time to spend a few weeks with some relations in
London. Her cousins were kind and wealthy; and, much pleased with the
modest intelligence of their young kinswoman, they exerted themselves
to render their house agreeable to her, and to show her the innumerable
sights of the Queen of Cities. So that her stay, being urged by James,

manifestly neglected, or opposed, the trust must necessarily be
forfeited, and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it,
who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and
security. And thus the community perpetually retains a supreme power of
saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any body, even of
their legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as
to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the
subject: for no man or society of men, having a power to deliver up
their preservation, or consequently the means of it, to the absolute
will and arbitrary dominion of another; when ever any one shall go about
to bring them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a
right to preserve, what they have not a power to part with; and to rid
themselves of those, who invade this fundamental, sacred, and
unalterable law of self-preservation, for which they entered into
society. And thus the community may be said in this respect to be always
the supreme power, but not as considered under any form of government,
because this power of the people can never take place till the
government be dissolved. Sect.",7370,1600s
"It must be quite finished before Herr Nirlanger should arrive. Frau
Nirlanger had purchased three tickets for the German theater, also as a
surprise, and I was to accompany the happily surprised husband and the
proud little wife of the new Amerikanische clothes. I coaxed her to let me do things to her hair. Usually she wore a stiff
and ugly coiffure that could only be described as a chignon. I do not
recollect ever having seen a chignon, but I know that it must look like
that.",1602,1800s
"Their Lodging or Bed is the Earth confined to a pair
of Stocks, for fear that they should run away: And it frequently
happens that they are drown'd with the toil of this kind of Fishing and
never more seen, for the _Tuberoms_ and _Maroxi_ (certain Marine
Monsters that devour a complete proportioned Man wholly at once) prey
upon them under Water. You must consider withall, that it is
impossible for the strongest constitution to continue long under Water
without breathing, and they ordinarily dye through the extream rigor of
the Cold, spitting Blood which is occasioned by the too great
compression of the Breast, procreated by a continued holding breath
under Water, for by too much cold a profluvium of blood follows. Their
hair naturally black is changed into a combust, burnt or Sun-colour
like that of the Sea Wolves, their shoulders and backs covered, or
overspread with a saltish humor that they appear rather like Monsters
in humane shape then Men. They have destroy'd all the _Lucayans_ by this intolerable or rather
Diabolical exercise, for the accustomary emolument or gain of lucre,
and by this means gain'd the value of fifty, sometime one hundred
Crowns of every individual _Indian_. They sell them (though it is
prohibited) publickly; for the _Lucayans_ were excellent Swimmers, and
several perished in this Isle that came from other Provinces.",20321,1400s

"Confined in the
pillory, she was obliged, without hope of revenge, to endure the insults
of those at whom she had imprudently scoffed when intoxicated with
power. And they were so much the more to be feared since they were
enticed by the certainty of impunity. Men, like animals, soon become
vicious when they know they are the stronger. She fled from London, and
her little cottage at Builth, in Wales, was invaded in its turn by all
that clique of people who make it their business to gloat over the
misfortunes of others. Charles, her favourite brother, and General Sir John Moore, the only
man, except Camelford, who had ever touched her heart, were both dead.",69806,1900s
"He could _touch_ them! Michael Thorenson, Mara Rosara,

"In the Collection of Voyages and Travels by Harris, this voyage is made
two separate articles, as if two distinct voyages, one under the name of
Captain Cowley, and the other under that of Dampier; though both are
avowedly only separate relations of the same voyage, which was commanded
by Captain Cooke, and ought to have gone under his name. On the present
occasion both relations are retained, for reasons which will appear
sufficiently obvious in the sequel; but we have placed both in one
chapter, because only a single circumnavigation, though somewhat
branched out by the separation of the original adventures. This chapter
is divided into three sections: the _first_ of which contains the
narrative of the principal voyage, so far as related by Captain Cowley;
along with which the observations of Dampier upon many of the places,
visited during the voyage, are introduced. The _second_ continues the
adventures of Cowley on his return from India to Europe, after
separating from his first companions. The _third_ resumes the relation
of the voyage, as written by Dampier, and gives a continuation of the
enterprise, after the separation of Cowley.",13130,1700s
"Ha? Little honor, to be much beleeu'd,

"Driven by what allurement, should I know? What morn forgotten by the prophets pours
    O’er dying distances, these dismal feasts? And you have seen me enter, nurse of winter,
    The heavy prison built of stone and iron

    And fatal, I advanced, with shielded hands,
    Through desert-perfume of these ancient kings:
    But have you still beheld my very dread? I stop to dream of exiles, and I strip,
    As near a pond whose gush of water welcomes,
    The pallid lilies in me, smitten, charmed
    My eyes pursue the languor of the wreck
    Descend, in silence, through my reverie,
    The lions part my indolence of robe
    And gaze on feet whose curves would calm the sea. Quiet the shudder of your crumbling flesh,

"The league
which the cities of Lombardy had formed against Frederick Barbarossa
still continued, and comprehended Milan, Brescia, Mantua, and the
greater number of the cities of Romagna, together with Verona, Vicenza,
Padua, and Trevisa. Those which took part with the emperor, were
Cremona, Bergamo, Parma, Reggio, and Trento. The other cities and
fortresses of Lombardy, Romagna, and the march of Trevisa, favored,
according to their necessities, sometimes one party, sometimes the
other. In the time of Otho III. there had come into Italy a man called Ezelin,
who, remaining in the country, had a son, and he too had a son named
Ezelin.",2464,1400s
"The subjection of a minor places in the father a temporary
government, which terminates with the minority of the child: and the
honour due from a child, places in the parents a perpetual right to
respect, reverence, support and compliance too, more or less, as the
father’s care, cost, and kindness in his education, has been more or
less. This ends not with minority, but holds in all parts and conditions
of a man’s life. The want of distinguishing these two powers, viz. that
which the father hath in the right of tuition, during minority, and the
right of honour all his life, may perhaps have caused a great part of
the mistakes about this matter: for to speak properly of them, the first
of these is rather the privilege of children, and duty of parents, than
any prerogative of paternal power. The nourishment and education of
their children is a charge so incumbent on parents for their children’s
good, that nothing can absolve them from taking care of it: and though
the power of commanding and chastising them go along with it, yet God
hath woven into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for
their off-spring, that there is little fear that parents should use
their power with too much rigour; the excess is seldom on the severe
side, the strong byass of nature drawing the other way.",7370,1600s
"Cries, several times
repeated, of ""Vive M. le Marechal de Boufflers!"" burst from the crowd. M. de Boufflers walked thus with M. de Grammont all along the Rue aux
Ours and the neighbouring streets, into the very centre of the sedition,
in fact. The people begged him to represent their misery to the King,
and to obtain for them some food. He promised this, and upon his word

acclamations of ""Vive M. le Marechal de Boufflers!""",3865,1600s

"The summer breeze that fans the rose,
    Or eddies down some flowery path,
      Is but the infant gale that blows
    To-morrow with the whirlwind's wrath. And He alone, who wields the storm,
    And bids the arrowy lightning play,
      Can guide the heart, when wild and warm,
    It springs on passion's wing away! One angel minister is sent,
    To guard and guide us to the sky,
      And still Her sheltering wing is bent,
    Till manhood rudely throws it by. Oh, then with mad disdain we spurn
    A mother's gentle teaching; throw
      Her bosom from us, and we burn,
    To rush in freedom, where the glow
      Of pleasure lights the dancing wave:
    We launch the bark, we woo the gale,
      And reckless of the darkling grave
    That yawns below, we speed the sail! XIII.",11558,1700s
"He was tugging at me anew, my insistent guide; and I felt sure, as I
rambled off in his wake, that he had more holiday matter to show me. And
so, indeed, he had; and all of it was to the same lawless tune. Like a
black pirate flag on the blue ocean of air, a hawk hung ominous; then,
plummet-wise, dropped to the hedgerow, whence there rose, thin and
shrill, a piteous voice of squealing. By the time I got there a whisk of feathers on the turf--like scattered
playbills--was all that remained to tell of the tragedy just enacted. Yet Nature smiled and sang on, pitiless, gay, impartial.",291,1800s
"The peasant, trembling lest his life was sought;
          The garlick chose, which presently was brought. UPON a dish my lord the number told;
          Clod no way liked the garlick to behold. With piteous mien the garlick head he took,
          Then on it num'rous ways was led to look,
          And grumbling much, began to spit and eat,
          just like a cat with mustard on her meat,
          To touch it with his tongue he durst not do;
          He knew not how to act or what pursue. The peer, delighted at the man's distress,
          The garlick made him bite, and chew, and press,
          Then gulp it down as if delicious fare;
          The first he passed; the second made him swear;
          The third he found was every whit as sad,
          He wished the devil had it, 'twas so bad. In short, when at the twelfth our wight arrived,
          He thought his mouth and throat of skin deprived.",5276,1600s
"They are enemies of Christ and of the pope, who bid the Word of God
be altogether silent in some Churches, in order that pardons may be
preached in others. 54. Injury is done the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an equal
or a longer time is spent on pardons than on this Word. 55. It must be the intention of the pope that if pardons, which are a
very small thing, are celebrated with one bell, with single processions
and ceremonies, then the Gospel, which is the very greatest thing,
should be preached with a hundred bells, a hundred processions, a
hundred ceremonies.",274,1400s

"In America
there is little difference between a law which the people of Oregon pass

Chinese there is all the difference in the world. The one is an act of the
government, and not of the people; the other, the act of the people, and
not of the government. The people may have powers over the government, but
never, by the wildest swing of imagination, can they discover themselves
personified in it. A Chinese democracy is almost a dyarchy of majority and
officialdom, the one revising and checking the other.",39356,1900s

"We concluded to make a tour between the inner fences. We elected
to walk upright, for convenience's sake; we argued that if discerned,
we should be taken for friends rather than enemies, and in any case
we should be out of reach of swords, and these gentry did not seem
to have any spears along. Well, it was a curious trip. Everywhere
dead men were lying outside the second fence--not plainly visible,
but still visible; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic
statues--dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire. One thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our current
was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out.",86,1800s

judged Bussi was there too, yet, being unwilling to find him, he was
going away. Bussi, however, who had concealed himself under the bed, as
not knowing to whom the orders for his arrest might be given, finding he
was to be left there, and sensible that he should be well treated by

"_Of their Rivers._


Lapland if any Country is well watered with springs and rivers: the
most noted are those from whence the particular marches and regions
have their names, as _Umeao_, _Pitheao_, _Luhleao_, _Torneao_, and
_Kimeao_, these spring from the _Norway_ mountains, and are encreased
by several less rivers, unburdening themselves at last into the
_Bothnick_ Sea. _Vindela_ fills _Umeao_ and _Skiellefle_ _Pitheao_,
_Luhleao_ swallows a less river of the same name, and _Kimeao_ is
encreased by _Avilaiocki_, which it self is no small river, for there
are numberless rivulets which run into it. So _Luhleao_ which has a
double stream, the lesser receives _Pyrrijaus Kardijoch_, and it is the
same case with the greater called _Stoor-Luhleao_, and _Tornæo_ which
is filled with the river _Kæungemæ Tængeleao_ and others. And so it is
with all the great rivers, which upon that account are so impetuous and
big, that they yield to few in the world: and because they run through
hilly and uneven Countrys, and are stopt by several dams & weares,
they force their way over precipices, with a great noise, and in those
places are not navigable. Such is the sluce at _Lughlens_, called
_Muskaumokke_, and another named _Sao_, likewise _Niometsaski_ i. e.
an Hares leap, so called because the river _Lughla_ runs between two
mountains so near that an Hare may leap over.",59695,1600s

as he rises louder and louder, as if he saw heaven opening, and
wanted to tell you how beautiful it was, and call you up there; and
then to think of killing and eating him, you would say, What cat can
be so unfeeling as a man? Who, with any music in his soul, could do
so?",4029,1700s

in this document ""on the disrepute which this innovation would bring upon
their ancient, respectable, and illustrious community. In suppressing
the title of Abbot of Saint Denis,"" they said further, ""your Majesty, in
reality, suppresses our abbey; and if our abbey is reduced to nothing,
our basilica, where the Kings, your ancestors, lie, will be no more than
a royal church, and will cease to be abbatial."" Further on, this petition said: ""Sire, may it please your Majesty, whose

"It is a great mistake to suppose that the effects of a fall in the
price of corn on cultivation may be fully compensated by a
diminution of rents. Rich land which yields a large net rent, may
indeed be kept up in its actual state, notwithstanding a fall in the
price of its produce: as a diminution of rent may be made entirely
to compensate this fall and all the additional expenses that belong
to a rich and highly taxed country. But in poor land, the fund of
rent will often be found quite insufficient for this purpose. There
is a good deal of land in this country of such a quality that the
expenses of its cultivation, together with the outgoings of poor
rates, tithes and taxes, will not allow the farmer to pay more than
a fifth or sixth of the value of the whole produce in the shape of
rent. If we were to suppose the prices of grain to fall from seventy
five shillings to fifty shillings the quarter, the whole of such a
rent would be absorbed, even if the price of the whole produce of
the farm did not fall in proportion to the price of grain, and
making some allowance for a fall in the price of labour.",4334,1700s

real pleasure when I walk from Charing Cross up the Strand, past St.

the highest to the lowest ranks, almost all well-looking people, and
cleanly and neatly dressed. I rarely see even a fellow with a
wheel-barrow who has not a shirt on, and that, too, such a one as shows
it has been washed; nor even a beggar without both a shirt and shoes and
stockings. The English are certainly distinguished for cleanliness. It has a very uncommon appearance in this tumult of people, where every
one, with hasty and eager step, seems to be pursuing either his business
or his pleasure, and everywhere making his way through the crowd, to
observe, as you often may, people pushing one against another, only
perhaps to see a funeral pass. The English coffins are made very

broad at top; tapering gradually from the middle, and drawing to a point

"The Queen was so well pleased with my prudent conduct that I can truly
say I was a favourite for some days. Madame de Carignan was telling her
one day that I was very homely, to which the Queen replied, “He has a
very fine set of teeth, and a man cannot be called homely who has this
ornament.”  Madame de Chevreuse remembered that she had often heard the
Queen say that the beauty of a man consisted chiefly in his teeth,
because it was the only beauty which was of any use. Therefore she
advised me to act my part well, and she should not despair of success. “When you are with the Queen,” said she, “be serious; look continually on
her hands, storm against the Cardinal, and I will take care of the rest”
 I asked two or three audiences of the Queen upon very trifling occasions,
followed Madame de Chevreuse’s plan very closely, and carried my
resentment and passion against the Cardinal even to extravagance. The
Queen, who was naturally a coquette, understood those airs, and
acquainted Madame de Chevreuse therewith, who pretended to be surprised,
saying, “Indeed, I have heard the Coadjutor talk of your Majesty whole
days with delight; but if the conversation happened to touch upon the
Cardinal, he was no longer the same man, and even raved against your
Majesty, but immediately relented towards you, though never towards the
Cardinal.”

Madame de Chevreuse, who was the Queen’s confidante in her youth, gave me
such a history of her early days as I cannot omit giving you, though I
should have done it sooner.",3846,1600s
"He
inquires into the statistics of the Exchange, and discovers that even

Universe. All the circulation centres here, and hence are derived all
those streams that give life and strength to the extremities. How vast,

"This rabid fury, however hurtful
to the father and son, was favorable to Cerrettieri; for the multitude,
wearied with their cruelty toward the former, quite forgot him, so that
he, not being asked for, remained in the palace, and during night was
conveyed safely away by his friends. The rage of the multitude being appeased by their blood, an agreement
was made that the duke and his people, with whatever belonged to him,
should quit the city in safety; that he should renounce all claim, of
whatever kind, upon Florence, and that upon his arrival in the Casentino
he should ratify his renunciation. On the sixth of August he set out,
accompanied by many citizens, and having arrived at the Casentino he
ratified the agreement, although unwillingly, and would not have kept
his word if Count Simon had not threatened to take him back to Florence. This duke, as his proceedings testified, was cruel and avaricious,
difficult to speak with, and haughty in reply. He desired the service of
men, not the cultivation of their better feelings, and strove rather
to inspire them with fear than love.",2464,1400s
"Concerning these opinions our teachers have given warning that they
depart from the Holy Scriptures and diminish the glory of the passion of
Christ. For Christ's passion was an oblation and satisfaction, not for
original guilt only, but also for all other sins, as it is written to
the Hebrews, 10, 10: We are sanctified through the offering of Jesus
Christ once for all. Also, 10, 14: By one offering He hath perfected
forever them that are sanctified. [It is an unheard-of innovation in
the Church to teach that Christ by His death made satisfaction only for
original sin and not likewise for all other sin. Accordingly it is hoped
that everybody will understand that this error has not been reproved
without due reason.]",275,1400s

"But it appears to me
that the Celts and Cantabrians were like the Etruscans and Phenicians of
Hamite Origin. It is strange that all the brown or black nations of
Africa, Asia and Oceania are also of similar descent. 7. In my work on the Ancient American Nations, may be seen which were
the oldest or earliest in America, and to which other nations elsewhere
they are most intimately connected. I have proved that two great nations
of America the _Aruac_ including the Haytians and tribes from Florida to
Patagonia, with the _Sekeh_ or old Chilians, having branches from Chili
to Brazil; were certainly very akin in language with the ancient Greeks
and Italians and Spaniards, or rather their ancestors the Pelagic, Oscan

"Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself
to his journey. Then said the Interpreter, The Comforter be always
with thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way that leads to
the City. So Christian went on his way, saying--

""Here I have seen things rare and profitable; Things pleasant,
dreadful, things to make me stable In what I have begun to take
in hand; Then let me think on them, and understand Wherefore they
showed me were, and let me be Thankful, O good Interpreter, to

was to go, was fenced on either side with a wall, and that wall

"Immediately after M. le Duc rose, and having made his reverences to the
King forgot to sit down and cover himself to speak, according to the
uninterrupted right and usage of the peers of France; therefore not one
of us rose. He made, then, slowly and uncovered, the speech which has
been printed at the end of the preceding ones, and read it not very
intelligibly because his organ was not favourable. As soon as he had
finished, M. le Duc d'Orleans rose, and committed the same fault. He
said, also standing and uncovered, that the request of M. le Duc appeared
to him just; and after some praises added, that M. le Duc du Maine was
now reduced to the rank given to him by his peerage, M. le Marechal de
Villeroy, his senior, could no longer remain under him, which was a new

what is good, but what they teach is not forthwith done. For they show
us what we ought to do, but do not give us the power to do it. They

through them he may learn his own impotence for good and may despair of
his own strength. For this reason they are called the Old Testament, and

not deviate in the least from the precepts and examples of the ancients,

discover some of the hidden beauties in their designs, that we thereby
may form our own in imitation of them. Will you please but to observe
that Persius, the least in dignity of all the three, has,
notwithstanding, been the first who has discovered to us this important
secret in the designing of a perfect satire—that it ought only to treat
of one subject; to be confined to one particular theme, or, at least, to
one principally? If other vices occur in the management of the chief,

it should be eaten once a year. You would find no sort of hint that it
should be taken upon the first of every quarter or upon one Sunday out

bondage, hunger, thirst, or any other outward evil, do to the soul,
when even the most pious of men and the freest in the purity of their
conscience, are harassed by these things? Neither of these states of
things has to do with the liberty or the slavery of the soul. And so it will profit nothing that the body should be adorned with
sacred vestments, or dwell in holy places, or be occupied in sacred
offices, or pray, fast, and abstain from certain meats, or do whatever
works can be done through the body and in the body. Something widely

"The Blood being in this depraved Condition, the rest of the Animal
Juices must degenerate in Proportion thereto, and the Nervous Fluid, as
it consists of the most volatil and subtil Parts, be extreamly acrid and
pungent, as well as unequal in its Texture and Fluidity, from the more
viscous Parts contain'd in it. [Sidenote: _Putrid Fevers how
produced._]

This then being the State of the Blood and other juices of the Body, it
is easy to perceive how from very Slight, and otherwise trivial
Occasions, a Fever of a very Malignant Nature may be produced. Thus the
perspirable Matter from a slight Cold taken being retained, or the
Vessels any otherwise filled by Irregularities in Diet, or others of the
Non-naturals, the Weight of the moving Fluid will be increased, and the
Circulation be more languid and slow. Whence the intestine Motion of the
Particles of the Blood being diminished, the viscous Parts will cohere
more strongly and in greater Quantities than before, and obstruct the
Capillary Arteries, especially in the Extremities, and a Coldness,
Stretching, Yawning, Torpor, _&c._ necessarily succeed, the constant
Attendants of a beginning Fever; All which will bear a Proportion to the
Quantity retain'd, and the Viscosity of the moving Fluid. These Disorders will necessarily be increased on account of the Air's
Spring being weakned by its Heat, the Vessels of the Lungs being less
inflated, and the Globules of the Blood less broken and divided, and the
more especially in a humid Air, Heat and Moisture necessarily relaxing
the Tone of the Fibres and Vessels, and rendring them less Springy and
Elastic.",49319,1600s
"As for those who think so Contemptibly of such a considerable part of
GOD’s Creation, as to suppose that we were made for nothing else but to
Admire and do them Service, and to make provision for the low concerns
of an Animal Life, we pity their mistake, and can calmly bear their
Scoffs, for they do not express so much Contempt of us as they do of
our Maker; and therefore the reproach of such incompetent Judges is not
an Injury but an Honor to us. The Ladies I hope pass a truer estimate on themselves, and need not
be told that they were made for nobler purposes. For tho I wou’d by
no means encourage Pride, yet I wou’d not have them take a mean and
groveling Spirit for true Humility. A being content with Ignorance is
really but a Pretence, for the frame of our nature is such that it is
impossible we shou’d be so; even those very Pretenders value themselves
for some Knowlege or other, tho it be a trifling or mistaken one. She who makes the most Grimace at a Woman of Sense, who employs all
her little skill in endeavouring to render Learning and Ingenuity
ridiculous, is yet very desirous to be thought Knowing in a Dress,
in the Management of an Intreague, in Coquetry or good Houswifry.",54984,1600s
"Start sorting that gear, boys.”

“Aye, aye, sir!” Mike said smartly. “No questions asked.”

Hank grunted approvingly as he brought the box up to his shoulder. “Good. We’ll get along fine.”

After about an hour’s work, the boats were beached and secured under
canvas covers, the mules were loaded and they were ready to mount. “I’ll
take the lead,” Hank announced.",50225,1900s

"In
front of these is a stone three and a-half feet by four and a-half,
and bearing the inscription: ``Tribute from the Ten Thousand
Countries of the World.'' The Chinese solemnly believe that
in these tablets all the nations of the earth have acknowledged
the preeminence of Confucius. Then we visited three gloomy buildings where the animals for
sacrifice are killed--one for cattle, one for sheep and one for
pigs. Beyond them, we entered temples to the wife of Confucius,
to his parents and to the ``Five Generations of
Ancestors,'' though the last-mentioned contains tablets to nine
generations instead of five. On every side are scores of monuments,
erected by or in honour of famous kings, some of them
by the monarchs of dynasties which flourished before the Christian
era.",1675,1800s
"That is the thing that I say, let them take heed, lest for
their unadvisedness the smart, as this poor woman has done. And ah! methinks, that they that yet are single persons, and that are tempted
to marry to such as Mr. Badman; would, to inform, and warn themselves
in this matter, before they intangle themselves, but goe to some that
already are in the snare, and ask them how it is with them, as to the
suitable, or unsuitableness of their marriage, and desire their advice. Surely they would ring such a peal in their ears about the unequality,
unsuitableness, disadvantages, and disquietments, and sins that attend
such marriages, that would make them beware as long as they live. But
the bird in the air, knows not the notes of the bird in the snare,
untill she comes thither herself: Besides, to make up such marriages,
Satan, and carnal Reason, and Lust, or at least Inconsiderateness, has
the chiefest hand; and where these things bear sway, designs, though
never so destructive, will goe headlong on: and therefore I fear, that
but little warning will be taken by young Girls, at Mr. Badmans wives
affliction.",1986,1600s

"These Bagnio’s took their Name from
_Corosia_, the Daughter of _Valens_ the Emperor, as _Sozomen_ observes
in the Ninth Chapter of his Sixth Book. _Martian_, says he, a Man of
consummate Learning, and great Austerity of Life, who had formerly
been one of the Emperor’s Life-Guard, but at that Time a Priest, was
a _Novatian_, and Tutor to _Anastasius_ and _Corosia_, the Son and
Daughter of _Valens_, in the Rudiments of Grammar. He adds, that there
were some _Bagnio’s_ at _Constantinople_ that were named from them. The Eighth _Ward_. _The eighth_ Ward, _on the Side of the_ Taurus, _is not bounded by
the Sea, and may be looked upon to be rather a narrow, than a broad
Piece of Ground; yet is this Defect sufficiently amended by its great
Length.",53083,1400s
"Still, at six o'clock next morning, there was a little crowd of seven
upon the pier, laughing and chatting at the little ""Virginie"" dipping
her bows in the water and flapping her sails in the brisk wind. Natalie's pink bonnet blushed in the early sunshine, and Natalie's
mamma, comely and portly, did chaperonage duty. It was not long before
the sails gave swell into the breeze and the little boat scurried to
the Sound. Past the lighthouse on its gawky iron stalls, she flew, and
now rounded the white sands of Cat Island. ""Bravo, the Gulf!""",688,1800s

"Some distance behind them was a band of women and between the
two bands was a kind of bier drawn by a horse with plumes at each of the
four corners. I took off my hat and stood close against the hedge on the
right-hand side till the dead had passed me some way to its final home. Crossed a river, which like that on the other side of Cemmaes streamed
down from a gulley between two hills into the valley of the Dyfi. Beyond
the bridge on the right-hand side of the road was a pretty cottage, just
as there was in the other locality. A fine tall woman stood at the door,
with a little child beside her.",648,1800s
"Ethbert entered the chamber of Theobald, who said to him, as soon as he
saw him, ""Ethbert, I have not yet seen your master to-day. Is he sick?"" ""My master,"" said Ethbert, ""is not now in the castle. But, my lord, you
must know that God is now displaying his goodness--""

highness’ most honorable counsel, to know if yet you
do recant your errors, conforming you unto the holy
church. COBHAM. My lord of Rochester, on good advise,
I see my error, but yet, understand me,
I mean not error in the faith I hold,
But error in submitting to your pleasure;
Therefore, your lordship, without more to do,
Must be a means to help me to escape.",1788,1500s

"Whence it appears, that
their being out of order is owing to their eating too much, and
of things disagreeing with their stomachs. There are other old gluttons, who say, that it is necessary they
should eat and drink a great deal, to keep up their natural heat,
which is constantly diminishing, as they advance in years; and that
it is, therefore, necessary to eat heartily, and of such things as
please their palate, be they hot, cold, or temperate; and that, were
they to lead a sober life, it would be a short one. To these I
answer, that our kind mother, nature, in order that old men may live
still to a greater age, has contrived matters so, that they should
be able to subsist on little, as I do; for, large quantities of
food cannot be digested by old and feeble stomachs. Nor should
such persons be afraid of shortening their days by eating too
little, since when they happen to be indisposed, they recover by
lessening the quantity of their food; for it is a trifle they eat,
when confined to a regimen, by observing which they get rid of their
disorder. Now, if by reducing themselves to a very small quantity
of food, they recover from the jaws of death, how can they doubt
but that with an increase of diet, still consistent however with
sobriety, they will be able to support nature when in perfect
health?",30660,1400s
"The warm fume of the basin was offensive to the invalid--""Me no likee
brothies,"" said she; and as it was not instantly removed, she unhappily
pushed away the plate, and turned the scalding contents of the basin
completely into the bosom of poor Matilda, as she reclined towards her. Shrieking with pain, and stamping with anger, Matilda instantly cried out
that she was murdered, and the wretch should be flayed alive. Ellen, shocked, terrified, and truly sorry, called out in an agony--""Mamma,
dear mamma, come here this moment! poor Matilda is scalded to death!"" The nurse, the servants, and Mrs. Harewood herself, were in a few moments
with the sufferer; and the latter, although she despatched the footman for
a surgeon, did not for a moment neglect the assistance and relief in her
own power to bestow; she scraped some white lead[1] into a little thick
cream, and applied it with a feather all over the scalded parts; and in a
very short time the excruciating pain was relieved, and the fire so well
drawn out by it, that when the surgeon arrived he made no change in the
application, but desired it might be persisted in, and said--""He had no
doubt of a cure being speedily obtained, if the patient were calm.""",21975,1700s

resentment is over with me, if she gives me but one kind look. All this time I was adjusting the horseman's coat, and Will. was putting
in the ties of my wig,* and buttoning the cape over my chin. * The fashionable wigs at that time. I asked the gentlewoman for a little powder.",10799,1600s
"It was no effigy of stone or metal or ivory. It was the actual body of a
woman, and by what dark art the ancients had preserved that form
unblemished for so many ages Conan could not even guess. The very
garments she wore were intact--and Conan scowled at that, a vague
uneasiness stirring at the back of his mind. The arts that preserved the
body should not have affected the garments. Yet there they were--gold
breast-plates set with concentric circles of small gems, gilded sandals,
and a short silken skirt upheld by a jeweled girdle.",42236,1900s
"That since it had been the ancient Custom of the
_Gauls_ and _Franks_ to wear their Hair long (as it was also of the
_Sicambri_, and of most others in those Parts) our Ancestors thought fit
to continue, and in Process of Time to appropriate this Ornament, and
Mark of Distinction to the Regal Family. No Person, tho' but
indifferently learn'd, needs any Proof that the _Gauls_ wore their Hair
long, especially when he calls to mind that of the Poet _Claudian_, ex
lib. in Ruffin. 2. _Inde truces flavo comitantur vertice_ Galli

  _Et quos nascentes explorat gurgite_ Rhenus.",17894,1500s
"“Why, yes,” I told them, “it’s through precocity. The new-rich American
no longer commits the blunder of keeping his children innocent. You’ll
see it beginning in the dancing-class, where I heard an exquisite little
girl of six say to a little boy, ‘Go away; I can’t dance with you,
because my mamma says your mamma only keeps a maid to answer the
doorbell.’ When they get home from the dancing-class, tutors in poker
and bridge are waiting to teach them how to gamble for each other’s
little dimes. I saw a little boy in knickerbockers and a wide collar
throw down the evening paper--”

“At that age? They read the papers?” interrupted Mrs. Gregory.",1386,1800s
"Let them send him to
psychometry. Let them clamp on the brain-probers and leave them on for
months. They'd not find any psycho tendencies in Greg Dalson. Greg tried to reason. But he had no place, no foundation, for a
beginning.",58670,1900s
"Such are my genuine and
no trifling satisfactions; such are the recreations and diversions
of my old age, which is so much the more to be valued than the old
age, or even youth, of other men, because being freed, by God's
grace, from the perturbations of the mind, and the infirmities of
the body, it no longer experiences any of those contrary emotions,
which torment a number of young men, and many old ones destitute of
strength and health, and every other blessing. And if it be lawful to compare little matters, and such as are
esteemed trifling, to affairs of importance, I will further
venture to say, that such are the effects of this sober life,
that at my present age of eighty-three, I have been able to write
a very entertaining comedy, abounding with innocent mirth and
pleasant jests. This species of composition is generally the child
and offspring of youth, as tragedy is that of old age; the former
being by its facetious and sprightly turn suited to the bloom of
life, and the latter by its gravity adapted to riper years. Now,
if that good old man [Sophocles], a Grecian by birth, and a poet,
was so much extolled for having written a tragedy at the age of
seventy-three, and, on that account alone, reputed of sound memory
and understanding, though tragedy be a grave and melancholy poem;
why should I be deemed less happy, and to have a smaller share of
memory and understanding, who have, at an age, ten years more
advanced than his, written a comedy, which, as every one knows,
is a merry and pleasant kind of composition? And, indeed, if I may
be allowed to be an impartial judge in my own cause, I cannot help
thinking, that I am now of sounder memory and understanding, and
heartier, than hew was when ten years younger.",30660,1400s
"“Listen, Pencroft,” resumed the engineer, “I will tell you what Captain
Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during
the exploration of Dakkar Grotto. “This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is
only separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it. Now, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow
the sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to
escape.”

“Well?” said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting. “Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure
from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that
after a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters
of the lake which fill the cavern.”

“Good!” replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. “The sea will
extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!”

“Not so!” said Cyrus Harding, “should a day arrive when the sea, rushing
through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the
interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day
be blown into the air--just as would happen to the island of Sicily were
the Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.”

The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer.",1268,1800s
"The influence of this place is assuredly
all that can be worst against one; _mail il faut lutter_. I was haunted
last night when I was in bed by the most cold, desolate recollections of
my past life here; I was glad to try and think of the forest, and warm my
hands at the thought of it. O the quiet, grey thickets, and the yellow
butterflies, and the woodpeckers, and the outlook over the plain as it
were over a sea! O for the good, fleshly stupidity of the woods, the
body conscious of itself all over and the mind forgotten, the clean air
nestling next your skin as though your clothes were gossamer, the eye
filled and content, the whole MAN HAPPY! Whereas here it takes a pull to
hold yourself together; it needs both hands, and a book of stoical
maxims, and a sort of bitterness at the heart by way of armour.—Ever your

VOLUME 10. CHAPTER LXX

The reign of Louis XIV.",3869,1600s
"She was human, fun-loving--and, above all, the joy of youth
was in her heart. Nonsense! West went inside and walked the floor. The idea was
preposterous. Still--he smiled--it was filled with amusing
possibilities.",1814,1800s
"Section 8

Miss Martin Leeds arrived punctually, but the doctor was well ahead of
his time and ready to receive her. She was ushered into the drawing room
where he awaited her. As she came forward the doctor first perceived
that she had a very sad and handsome face, the face of a sensitive youth
rather than the face of a woman. She had fine grey eyes under very
fine brows; they were eyes that at other times might have laughed very
agreeably, but which were now full of an unrestrained sadness. Her brown
hair was very untidy and parted at the side like a man’s.",1734,1800s
"It was therefore necessary to take immediate measures to
avert, if possible, an evil that threatened so fearful consequences;
and the only course that presented itself was to divide into two
parties,--the one to proceed with all possible despatch to the fort,
by the shortest route, and to send forward a supply to the other,
which it was anticipated would reach them ere they were reduced to
absolute want. Pursuant to this resolution I set off, accompanied by the guide and
H. Hay; leaving D. Henderson to make the best of his way, with the
Esquimaux and Pellican. Having taken but a very small share of the
provisions with us, and meeting with no game on the way, we were
soon reduced to the utmost extremity. One of our dogs being starved
to death, we were ultimately obliged to knock the surviving one on
the head, to supply ourselves with what we considered, in present
circumstances, ""food for the gods."" Such as it was, it enabled us to
keep soul and body together till we reached Fort Chimo, on the 20th
of April, where we found all the Nascopies of this part of the country
assembled to greet the arrival of their long-expected friends--our
guides.",16864,1700s
"ochraventer_ are
well-marked differences. The baculum of _P. ochraventer_ is much
shorter with a proportionately heavier base and shaft than the baculum
of _P. mexicanus mexicanus_ (from Veracruz) and _P. m. saxatilis_ (from
Costa Rica).",31448,1900s
"There is much of elegance, and more
of comfort in England. It is a great and a good country, Mr. Poker, but
there is no natur in it.’

“It is as true as gospel,” said Mr. Slick, “I’m tellin’ you no lie. It’s
a fact. If you expect to paint them English, as you have the Blue-Noses
and us, you’ll pull your line up without a fish, oftener than you are
a-thinkin’ on; that’s the reason all our folks have failed.",7821,1700s
"Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst. ANNE. Foul devil, for God’s sake, hence, and trouble us not;
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims. If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries. O, gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds
Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!",1503,1500s
"_Procopius_ tells us, in his first Book _de Ædif. Justin._ that
the _Hepdomum_ was one Part of the Suburbs of _Constantinople_. _Justinian_, says he, built another Church dedicate to St. _Theodora_
in a Place call’d the _Hepdomum_, which in the _Greek_ signifies the
_Seventh_. _Zonaras_, in the Life of _Phocas_, mentions the same
Thing, as does also _Cedrinus_ in the Life of _Arcadius_ and _Justin_,
with many others. In this Place were many Laws enacted; and _Zonaras_
writes, that _Theodosius_ the _Great_ built a Church there, in Honour
of St. _John Baptist_.",53083,1400s
"Oh, it’s beautiful, Connie. Raise me up higher.”

“I can’t,” said Connie. “Pull yourself up on the edge of the car. Then
you can see better.”

Veve swung herself to the edge of the circus car. She sat in the open
doorway, her feet swinging over the side.",51745,1900s
"xan. But howe couldest thou fashyon thye selfe after hys wyll and
mynde, that eyther woulde not be at home or elles be as freshe as a saulte

  praty nymphe of the couert. Poliphemus. By my
  trouth and well coniectured, be holde what a
  goodly pursenet, or a hay I haue here in my hande. Cannius. Benedicite, what a straunge syght is

"After dinner, we embarked on the river
in a very beautiful boat, surrounded by others having on board musicians
playing on hautboys, horns, and violins, and landed at an island where
Don John had caused a collation to be prepared in a large bower formed
with branches of ivy, in which the musicians were placed in small
recesses, playing on their instruments during the time of supper. The
tables being removed, the dances began, and lasted till it was time to
return, which I did in the same boat that conveyed me thither, and which
was that provided for my voyage. The next morning Don John conducted me to the boat, and there took a most
polite and courteous leave, charging M. and Madame d'Aurec to see me safe
to Huy, the first town belonging to the Bishop of Liege, where I was to
sleep. As soon as Don John had gone on shore, M. d'Ainsi, who remained
in the boat, and who had the Bishop of Cambray's permission to go to
Namur only, took leave of me with many protestations of fidelity and
attachment to my brother and myself. But Fortune, envious of my hitherto prosperous journey, gave me two omens
of the sinister events of my return.",3839,1500s
"“_Which were born_, _not of blood_, _nor of the will of the flesh_,
             _nor of the will of man_, _but of God_;” John i. 13. THE words have a dependence on what goes before, and therefore I must
direct you to them for the right understanding of it. You have it
thus,—“He came to his own, but his own received him not; but as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
them which believe on his name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, but of God.”  In the words before, you have two
things—

_First_, Some of his own rejecting him when he offered himself to them. _Secondly_, Others of his own receiving him, and making him welcome.",3613,1600s
"If they happen to have learning, it is only
Greek and Latin, but not one word of modern history, or modern languages. Thus prepared, they go abroad, as they call it; but, in truth, they stay
at home all that while; for being very awkward, confoundedly ashamed, and
not speaking the languages, they go into no foreign company, at least
none good; but dine and sup with one another only at the tavern. Such
examples, I am sure, you will not imitate, but even carefully avoid. You
will always take care to keep the best company in the place where you
are, which is the only use of traveling: and (by the way) the pleasures
of a gentleman are only to be found in the best company; for that not
which low company, most falsely and impudently, call pleasure, is only
the sensuality of a swine. I ask hard and uninterrupted study from you but one year more; after
that, you shall have every day more and more time for your amusements.",3352,1600s
"[Sidenote: Garden Bank]

This Bank whereon is from 7 to 17 Fathom Water, lies about half a Mile
off from _Little St. Laurence_, with _Blue Beach Point_ on with the
East Point of _Great St. Laurence_. [Sidenote: Ferryland Head.] _Ferryland head_ lies S.W. 1 Mile from Cape _Chapeaurouge_, it is a
high rocky Island, just seperated from the Main; it and Cape
_Chapeaurouge_ are sufficient Marks to know the Harbours of St.
_Laurence_. [Sidenote: Bay of Laun.]",21915,1700s
"THE lover from the belle at length arose,
          And hastened to his house to seek repose;
          But scarcely had he placed himself in bed,
          When our good husband's footsteps thither led;
          He, to the spark, related with delight,
          How mandrake-juice succeeded in the night. Said he, at first beside the bed I crept,
          And listened if the miller near her kept,
          Or whether he to converse was inclined,
          And ev'ry way to act as was designed. I then my wife was anxious to address,
          And whispered that she should the youth caress;
          Nor dread too much the spoiling of her charms:

The two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on
his face. “Well, my friend,” cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, “what do
you think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not
figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to
say anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.”

remarked.",863,1800s

"Procopius (died _ca._ 535) describes a monumental water clock which was
erected in Gaza _ca._ 500. [17] It contained impressive jackwork, such as
a Medusa head which rolled its eyes every hour on the hour, exhibiting
the time through lighted apertures and showing mythological
interpretations of the cosmos. All these effects were produced by
Heronic techniques, using hydraulic power and puppets moved by strings,
rather than with gearing. Again in 807 a similarly marvelous exhibition clock made of bronze was
sent by Harun-al-Rashid to the Emperor Charlemagne; it seems to have
been of the same type, with automata and hydraulic works. For the
succeeding few centuries, Islam was in its Golden Age of development of
technical astronomy (_ca._ 950-1150) and attention may have been
concentrated on the more mathematical protoclocks.",30001,1900s
"Among those monstrous evils of this age with which I have now for three
years been waging war, I am sometimes compelled to look to you and to
call you to mind, most blessed father Leo. In truth, since you alone are
everywhere considered as being the cause of my engaging in war, I cannot
at any time fail to remember you; and although I have been compelled
by the causeless raging of your impious flatterers against me to appeal
from your seat to a future council--fearless of the futile decrees
of your predecessors Pius and Julius, who in their foolish tyranny
prohibited such an action--yet I have never been so alienated in feeling
from your Blessedness as not to have sought with all my might, in
diligent prayer and crying to God, all the best gifts for you and for
your see. But those who have hitherto endeavoured to terrify me with the
majesty of your name and authority, I have begun quite to despise and
triumph over. One thing I see remaining which I cannot despise, and this
has been the reason of my writing anew to your Blessedness: namely, that
I find that blame is cast on me, and that it is imputed to me as a great
offence, that in my rashness I am judged to have spared not even your
person. Now, to confess the truth openly, I am conscious that, whenever I have
had to mention your person, I have said nothing of you but what was
honourable and good.",1911,1400s

them from gettin' wet, and he tetched the old boss on the sides and he

"“Go it, Bill!” exclaimed Joe, “pitch into him and scramble up.”

The dog ran at him.--Joe in his agitation fell from his position, while
Bill threw his rod at the beast, made a desperate leap, and clutched the
top of the wall with his hands. “Egad! I've lost my seat,” cried Joe, rolling upon the grass. “And so have I!” roared Bill, scrambling in affright over the wall. And true it was, that he who had not got a bite before, had got a
bite--behind!",5650,1700s
"The carter seeing that the armed lunatic was resolute, ""Good sir,"" said
he, ""for charity's sake, be pleased to let me take off my mules and get
with them out of danger, before the lions are let loose: for should my
cattle be killed, I am undone for ever, as I have no other means of
living than by this cart and these mules."" ""Incredulous wretch!"" cried Don Quixote, ""unyoke and do as thou wilt;

"""When

by those who travel. Well-bred and polite people conform to native
customs no matter how strange they may appear. And they do it
gracefully, with a smile of friendliness rather than one of disdain. In her book ""Fear and Conventionality,"" Elsie Parsons relates an

"It had
likewise this other good effect, that I no longer experienced
those annual fits of sickness, with which I used to be afflicted,
while I followed a different, that is a sensual, course of life;
for then I used to be attacked every year with a strange kind of
fever, which sometimes brought me to death's door. From this
disease, then, I also freed myself, and became exceeding healthy,
as I have continued from that time forward to this very day; and
for no other reason than that I never trespassed against
regularity, which by its infinite efficacy has been the cause,
that the meat I constantly eat, and the wine I constantly drink,
being such as agreed with my constitution, and taken in proper
quantities, imparted all their virtue to my body, and then left
it without difficulty, and without engendering in it any bad
humours. In consequence therfore of my taking such methods, I have
always enjoyed, and (God be praised) actually enjoy, the
best of healths. It is true, indeed, that, besides the two
forgoing most important rules relative to eating and drinking,
which I have ever been very scrupulous to observe; that is,
not to take of any thing, but as much as my stomach can easily
digest, and to use those things only, which agree with me; I
have carefully avoided heat, cold, and extraordinary fatigue,
interruption of my usual hours of rest, excessive venery, making
any stay in bad air, and exposing myself to the wind and sun; for
these, too, are great disorders. But then, fortunately, there is
no great difficulty in avoiding them, the love of life and health
having more sway over men of understanding, than any satisfaction
they could find in doing what must be extremely hurtful to their
constitution.",30660,1400s
"They had laid no
regular plan, for their defence. Upon their first failure they seamed to
have no resources left. On the slightest loss they betook themselves to
treaty and submission; upon the least appearance in their favor they
were as ready to resume their arms, without any regard to their former
engagements: a conduct which demonstrates that our British ancestors had
no regular polity with a standing coercive power. The ambassadors which
they sent to Cæsar laid all the blame of a war carried on by great
armies upon the rashness of their young men, and they declared that the
ruling people had no share in these hostilities. This is exactly the
excuse which the savages of America, who have no regular government,
make at this day upon the like occasions; but it would be a strange
apology from one of the modern states of Europe that had employed armies
against another.",16292,1700s

"Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;
     For by some freakful chance he made retire
     From his companions, and set forth to walk,
     Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:
     Over the solitary hills he fared,
     Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared
     His phantasy was lost, where reason fades,
     In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades. Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near--
     Close to her passing, in indifference drear,
     His silent sandals swept the mossy green;
     So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen
     She stood: he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,
     His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes
     Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white
     Turn'd--syllabling thus, ""Ah, Lycius bright,
     And will you leave me on the hills alone? Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown."" He did; not with cold wonder fearingly,
     But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;
     For so delicious were the words she sung,
     It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long:
     And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,
     Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,
     And still the cup was full,--while he afraid
     Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
     Due adoration, thus began to adore;
     Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure:

earnestly cried out, ""Lord, help me!"" She seemed reduced to the last
extremity; and yet, like Esther, who resolved to go in to the king,
whether she perished or not, and like Jonah, tossing about amongst the
waves of the ocean, determining ""to look again towards the holy temple of
Jehovah,"" she ventured to renew her application, and in language implying

suppose, by the thousand, and she must have passed dozens of such shops

article on West Highland terriers might as well have been written in a
missal stored away in some Buddhist monastery in Eastern Thibet. The brutal directness of the masculine shopper arouses a certain
combative derision in the feminine onlooker. A cat that spreads one
shrew-mouse over the greater part of a long summer afternoon, and then
possibly loses him, doubtless feels the same contempt for the terrier who
compresses his rat into ten seconds of the strenuous life. I was

Arthur Elphinstone was born in the year 1688. He had, until late in
life, no expectation of succeeding to the title of his father after the
death of Hugh, there being still an elder brother, James. The
characteristics of all this branch of the Elphinstone family appear
almost invariably to have been those of honour and justice, and James
resembled his father in the integrity of his principles. The following
character is drawn of him by a contemporary writer: ""He was rather a
solid pleader than a refined orator; but he understood the law so well,
and preserved the chastity of his character so tenderly, by avoiding
being concerned in any scandalous actions, that he was listened to with
great attention by the bench, at a time when it was filled by the most
eminent lawyers that ever appeared in Scotland."" The abilities of this able and conscientious man soon raised him to the

integrity which can only be described by the word honour.",20948,1700s

contrary, the trees bear the fruit, and the fruit grows on the trees. As then trees must exist before their fruit, and as the fruit does not
make the tree either good or bad, but on the contrary, a tree of either
kind produces fruit of the same kind, so must first the person of the
man be good or bad before he can do either a good or a bad work; and his
works do not make him bad or good, but he himself makes his works either
bad or good.",1911,1400s

country now forms a separate republic. Spain might with ease have retained these fertile provinces under
allegiance. Had their fidelity received the smallest encouragement, it
would probably never have been shaken; and California would have proved
a most convenient support for the claims of the mother country on the

A LOVER'S COMPLAINT

by William Shakespeare




  From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
  A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
  My spirits t'attend this double voice accorded,
  And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Tearing of papers, breaking rings atwain,
  Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain. Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Which fortified her visage from the sun,
  Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
  The carcase of a beauty spent and done.",1137,1500s
"With whom they had been engaged they
knew not--_Cossacks_, of course. We looked forward with certainty to a
general engagement. It became every hour more dangerous for the
inquisitive to venture out or in at the gates. There was no end to the
marching of horse and foot and the rolling of carriages; at every ten
paces you met in all directions with _corps de garde_, by whom every
non-military person without distinction was ordered back, sometimes with
fair words, and at others with rudeness. Several couriers had been sent
forward to announce the speedy arrival of the king of Saxony and
Napoleon.",17595,1700s
"The weeks sped by, and Knopfschrank came more rarely to the restaurant in
Owl Street, while his meals on those occasions became more and more
meagre. And then came a triumphal day, when he appeared early in the
evening in a high state of elation, and ordered an elaborate meal that
scarcely stopped short of being a banquet. The ordinary resources of the
kitchen were supplemented by an imported dish of smoked goosebreast, a
Pomeranian delicacy that was luckily procurable at a firm of
_delikatessen_ merchants in Coventry Street, while a long-necked bottle
of Rhine wine gave a finishing touch of festivity and good cheer to the
crowded table. “He has evidently sold his masterpiece,” whispered Sylvia Strubble to
Mrs. Nougat-Jones, who had come in late. “Who has bought it?” she whispered back.",269,1800s

omit to give you one of its singularities within; it is an ancient and
curious inscription in large Gothic letters, near the organ:

TRO, _Trophemus_; GAL, _Galliæorum_; and APO, _Apostolus_. The letter H,
belonging to the word _Joseph_, must be carried to the word _Orcho_, and
the P must stand by itself. _Trophimus Galliarum Apostolus, ut ros missus est, ex urbe Romæ rerum

were cheerful, even to loud mirth; and the smallness of the party, compared
with the size of the hall, caused the sounds of our voices to be
reverberated from every quarter. Meantime, the sun threw his radiant beams
through a window of noble dimensions, quite across the saloon--so as to
keep us in shadow, and illuminate the other parts of the room. Thus we were
cool, but the day without had begun to be sultry. Behind me, or rather
between the Abbot and myself, stood a grave, sedate, and inflexible-looking
attendant--of large, square dimensions--habited in a black gown, which
scarcely reached the skirts of his coat. He spake not; he moved not; save
when he saw my glass emptied, which without any previous notice or
permission, he made a scrupulous point of filling ... even to the very
brim!...",17624,1700s

plunder it. The Quarter-master hearing of it, goes out of the Cabin,
and asks the reason of his so doing; the young Man replied, “As they
were all Pirates, he thought he did what was right.” On that the
Quarter-master strikes at him with his broad Sword, but the young
Man running away, escaped the Blow, and fled for protection into
the great Cabin to his Master Captain _Davis_. The Quarter-master
pursues him in a great Passion; and there not being room amongst
so many of us, to make a stroke at him, he made a thrust with his
Sword, and slit the Ball of one of the young Man’s Thumbs, and
slightly wounded at the same time Captain _Davis_ on the back of one
of his Hands. _Davis_ upon that was all on Fire, and vowed Revenge,
saying, “That tho’ his Man had offended, he ought to have been first
acquainted with it; for no other Person had a right to punish him
in his Presence;” and immediately goes on board his own Ship. Where

complains of the dislike which she shows to return to court; but in
neither of them does he allude to the pestilential disease which in that
year committed such ravages in England. In the third (10), however, he
does advert to it as a disorder which has prevailed for some time, and on
which he makes some observations. Between this letter, probably written in the month of July, and the sixth
(17), in which the king speaks of the arrival of the legate in Paris, and
which must have been written about the end of September, there are two
letters (1 and 5) certainly written within a few days of each other.",32155,1400s
"Virginia was quick to perceive the necessity for haste, while the
pirates at the same instant realized the menace of the new danger which
confronted them. A score of muskets belched forth their missiles at the
fearless girl behind the scant shield of the machine gun. Leaden
pellets rained heavily upon her protection, or whizzed threateningly
about her head—and then she got the gun into action. At the rate of fifty a minute, a stream of projectiles tore into the
bow of the prahu when suddenly a richly garbed Malay in the stern rose
to his feet waving a white cloth upon the point of his kris. It was the
Rajah Muda Saffir—he had seen the girl’s face and at the sight of it
the blood lust in his breast had been supplanted by another.",96,1800s

however, is in ruins, and but two sides of the square, consisting of
mere walls, remain entire; the others have been wantonly destroyed. The church at San Antonio de Bejar was built in the year 1717; and
although it has suffered much from the many sieges which the city has
undergone, it is still used as a place of public worship. At the time
that San Antonio was attacked and taken by Colonel Cooke, in 1835,
several cannon-shots struck the dome, and a great deal of damage was
done; in fact, all the houses in the principal square of the town are
marked more or less by shot. One among them has suffered very much; it
is the ""Government-house,"" celebrated for one of the most cowardly

"The Florentines used the weightiest arguments they could adopt to
prevent the count from quitting the service of the League, a course he
was himself reluctant to follow, but his desire to conclude the marriage
so embarrassed him, that any trivial accident would have been sufficient
to determine his course, as indeed shortly happened. The count had
left his territories in La Marca to the care of Il Furlano, one of his
principal condottieri, who was so far influenced by the duke as to
take command under him, and quit the count's service. This circumstance
caused the latter to lay aside every idea but that of his own safety,
and to come to agreement with the duke; among the terms of which compact
was one that he should not be expected to interfere in the affairs of
Romagna and Tuscany. The count then urged the Florentines to come to
terms with the Lucchese, and so convinced them of the necessity of this,
that seeing no better course to adopt, they complied in April, 1438, by
which treaty the Lucchese retained their liberty, and the Florentines
Monte Carlo and a few other fortresses. After this, being full
of exasperation, they despatched letters to every part of Italy,
overcharged with complaints, affecting to show that since God and men

peace with them.",2464,1400s

"This useful work was translated some years ago into English, under
the title of _Sure and certain methods of attaining a long and
healthy life_. The translator seems rather to have made use of a
French version than of the Italian original; he has likewise
omitted several passages of the Italian, and the whole is rather a
paraphrase than a translation. This has induced us to give the
public an exact and faithful version of that excellent performance,
from the Venice edition in 8vo, in the year 1620 [1]: and as a proof
of the merit and authenticity of the work, we beg leave to quote

"Montoni was now also become a daily guest at the château, and Emily was
compelled to observe, that he really was a suitor, and a favoured
suitor, to her aunt. Thus passed the winter months, not only in peace, but in happiness, to
Valancourt and Emily; the station of his regiment being so near
Thoulouse, as to allow this frequent intercourse. The pavilion on the
terrace was the favourite scene of their interviews, and there Emily,
with Madame Cheron, would work, while Valancourt read aloud works of
genius and taste, listened to her enthusiasm, expressed his own, and
caught new opportunities of observing, that their minds were formed to
constitute the happiness of each other, the same taste, the same noble
and benevolent sentiments animating each. CHAPTER XIII

Placed far amid the melancholy main,

The whilst in ocean Phœbus dips his wain,
A vast assembly moving to and fro,
Then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show. CASTLE OF INDOLENCE

"For in conclusion, to reduce all to the most refin'd, and polite
Language, is not what I pretend to; the Barbarous stile of the ancient
Romans will do me as much service, as the quaintnesse, and elegance of
Cicero; the Latin of the declining Empire, since the irruptions of the
Northern Nations, may be admitted into this designe to as good purpose, as
the language of Augustus his time; any sense is the same of that of the
_Sciences_, which makes one almost altogether distinct from what is common
and vulgar; the proper names of Philosophy, naturall History, and Divinity,
those of Physick, and the Mathematicks, of Arts, Law, and Commerce; the
names of illustrious persons, people and places, of which History
furnisheth us with a plausible account, will afford me no lesse assistance
on this occasion, then the names of things that are most common. After having made choice of a Language in order to the design, I am in the
next place to determine my self to a _certain number of them_, the reunion
of which may be justly thought a modest and reasonable attempt; for as
there are some, the knowledge of which will be of very little use; so I am
obliged to prescribe some bounds to a designe that would lead me to
something indetermin'd, and infinite, and withall I suspect the inlargement
both of mind, and memory to compasse all; especially considering the
consequence of some to be indifferent, neither that of Biscany, nor the
lower Brettaigne should in my opinion much afflict any mans braine, nor do
I believe that there are many more in the world interest for them, then
there are for the dialect of Finland or Frizland, or the Barbarous jangling
of the Negroes and Savages. In the choise that I was to make I could not
but give the preference to those of the greatest credit and repute, _took
some Prince_ (excuse the allusion) _who having laid his design to reunite
all the Kingdomes of the world, began his conquest upon those Nations that
were most formidable and renown'd, from an apprehension that the rest in a
little time would be less able to make any opposition._

As I am not of an humour to attempt any thing without an incouragement from
reason; or to give my selfe any trouble through a kind of caprice, purely
to gratifie my curiositie; _Religion_, _State_, and the _Sciences_ are the
_three grand rules_ from which I make a judgement what Languages are really
the most important and noble; I have only therefore selected such as
_Europe_ may use to the best advantage, either for the defence of the
Church, the good of the State, the advancement of the Sciences, or the
perfection of the most laudable Arts. It is for this end that I have
entertained in my designe all the Languages that concerne Religion, and
make a particular mention of such as furnish us with originall texts, and
the most authentick translations of the Bible, being of no mean consequence
towards the faithfull interpretation of our sacred Records, and the
confirmation of the Articles of our Creed. I am in the next place obliged to find a place for such as concern and
relate to State affaires, the most renowned Empires, Kingdomes, and warlike
Nations, which may afford a suitable entertainment for all sorts of people,
and withall very much conduce to the succesful management of forraigne

place and self the second is to do good for the sake of the church, the
country, society, and the neighbor; and the goods that man does to these
for the sake of these are not from man but from the Lord. The
difference between these two is like the difference between heaven and
hell. Man does not know that there is such a difference, because from
birth and thus from nature he is in these loves, and because the delight
of these loves continually flatters and pleases him. But let him consider that a love of ruling from delight in ruling, and
not from a delight in uses, is wholly devilish; and such a man may be
called an atheist; for so far as he is in that love he does not in his
heart believe in the existence of God, and to the same extent he derides
in his heart all things of the church, and he even hates and pursues
with hatred all who acknowledge God, and especially those who
acknowledge the Lord. The very delight of the life of such is to do

"But from what
hath been said, it is, I think, evident, that this advantage may be
over-ballanced by our employing American missionaries. Nor is the honour of the crown, nation, and church of England
unconcerned in this scheme; which, it is to be hoped, will remove the
reproach, we have so long lain under, that we fall as far short of our
neighbours of the Romish communion in zeal for propagating religion, as
we surpass them in the soundness and purity of it. And at the same
time, that the doing what may be so easily done, takes away our
reproach; it will cast no small lustre on his majesty's reign, and
derive a blessing from heaven on his administration, and those who live
under the influence thereof. Men of narrow minds have a peculiar talent at objection, being never at
a loss for something to say against whatsoever is not of their own
proposing. And perhaps, it will be said in opposition to this proposal,
that if we thought ourselves capable of gaining converts to the church,
we ought to begin with infidels, papists, and dissenters of all
denominations at home, and to make proselytes of these before we think
of foreigners; and that therefore our scheme is against duty.",31848,1600s

all actually disposed of in _eight days_, of which the widow gave
early information, accompanied by letters to M. ----, and to the
benevolent donors in England, expressing, in the most cordial manner,
her gratitude, and that of those who had thus been supplied with the
word of life. She gave a particular statement of the eagerness with
which they had been read; of their distribution in many Catholic
families, and the conversion of some to the truth as it is in Jesus. She informed that many individuals and families were still unsupplied;
and for herself, and those around her, expressed her thanksgivings
to God for the wonders of his love in inspiring the hearts of his
children to unite their efforts in Bible and other benevolent
institutions, and to contribute of their substance to extend to the
destitute a knowledge of the Gospel.",10831,1700s
"To consider their power in spiritual and moral things particularly,
we shall find they have no power in some things, but by their fall have
utterly lost it, as is apparent in these few points. 1. They have lost
that freedom of will that they had by Creation, and were partakers of
before they fell, and agreeable to this is the _Thesis_ of learned
_Zanchy_, which is this: “That all Devils have so far their wills made
obstinate in sins, the hatred of God, Christ, and of Mankind, that from
this evil they cannot will to repent, and thereby be saved;” and this he
thus proveth. 1. Because in the Scriptures they are called, πονυροὺς
κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, for they are now become such, that they cannot be changed
from their malice and wickedness; because it is become natural unto
them.",72654,1600s
"Spinoza and Behmen were, on different systems, both Pantheists; and
among the ancients there were philosophers, teachers of the EN KAI PAN,
who not only taught that God was All, but that this All constituted God. Yet not even these would confound the part, as a part, with the
whole, as the whole. Nay, in no system is the distinction between
the individual and God, between the Modification, and the one only
Substance, more sharply drawn, than in that of Spinoza. Jacobi indeed
relates of Lessing, that, after a conversation with him at the house of
the Poet, Gleim, (the Tyrtaeus and Anacreon of the German Parnassus,) in
which conversation Lessing had avowed privately to Jacobi his reluctance
to admit any personal existence of the Supreme Being, or the possibility
of personality except in a finite Intellect, and while they were sitting
at table, a shower of rain came on unexpectedly. Gleim expressed his
regret at the circumstance, because they had meant to drink their
wine in the garden: upon which Lessing in one of his half-earnest,
half-joking moods, nodded to Jacobi, and said, “It is I, perhaps, that
am doing that,” i.e.",6081,1700s
"This prevents
the Chain from falling down, and getting under the Horse’s Legs in
turning; but beware that this String or Chain be not so short as to
hold up the Traces higher than their strait Line; for that would press
upon the Collar, and gall the Thiller, besides occasioning the Plough
to be drawn too much upwards; for this drawing of the fore Horse by
a different Line from that of the Thiller, is a great Advantage for
keeping the Plough the firmer into the Ground. If there is another Horse, his Traces are fastened at the Collar of the
Second, in the same manner as in drawing of a Waggon. When we hoe betwixt Rows, where the Plants are very high, as those
of Turnep-seed, which are much higher than the Horses, to turn a new
Furrow up to the Row, when there is a Trench in the Middle of the
Interval, where the Horses must go, we find it best to place the Beam
by the Holes B and E, in _Fig._ 3. and the Draw-pin near the left
Limber, which brings the Tail of the Plough to the Right-hand, and the
fore Ends of the Limbers being towards the Left, the End of the right
Limber (by turning the Handles a little to the Left) bears against the
wooden Saddle at _d_, and cannot hitch into or take hold of any of the
Plants to tear them. And that no Part of the Limber may take hold of
any Plant, we make it very smooth from one End to the other; and cut
off the Corner of the Plank equal with the Limber, that the Plants may
slip by it without hanging in it, or being broken by it. The Whipper
standing towards the left End of the Plank, its End _b_ does not reach
so far towards the right as to take hold of the Plants, its End _a_
being over the Interval, where no Plants are; and to keep its right End
the more out of Danger of hurting the Plants, we place the Hook of its
Chain nearer towards this End, by which means the left End, becoming
heavier, sinks lower, and raises the right End higher; and the higher
it is, the more secure the Plants will be from it; because they are
held off by the Limber above.",74741,1600s

left-handed wisdom, and which is never made use of but by those who have
not true wisdom. And the same great man says, that dissimulation is only
to hide our own cards, whereas simulation is put on, in order to look
into other people’s. Lord Bolingbroke, in his “Idea of a Patriot King,”
 which he has lately published, and which I will send you by the first
opportunity, says very justly that simulation is a STILETTO,--not only an
unjust but an unlawful weapon, and the use of it very rarely to be
excused, never justified. Whereas dissimulation is a shield, as secrecy
is armor; and it is no more possible to preserve secrecy in business,
without same degree of dissimulation, than it is to succeed in business
without secrecy.",3361,1600s

"As the fame and renown of the paintings of Giotto and his pupils had
been spread abroad for many years, many, who were desirous of
obtaining fame and riches by means of the art of painting, began to
be animated by the hope of glory, and by natural inclination, to make
progress towards the improvement of the art, feeling confident that,
with effort, they would be able to surpass in excellence Giotto,
Taddeo, and the other painters. Among these was one Jacopo di
Casentino, who was born, as we read, of the family of M. Cristoforo
Landino of Pratovecchio, and was associated by the friar of
Casentino, then superior at the Sasso del Vernia, with Taddeo Gaddi,
while he was working in that convent, in order that he might learn
design and colour. In a few years he so far succeeded, that, being
taken to Florence in the company of Giovanni di Milano, in the
service of their master, Taddeo, where they were doing many things,
he was asked to paint in tempera the tabernacle of the Madonna of the
Old Market, with the picture there, and also the one on the Via del
Cocomoro side of the Piazza S. Niccolo. A few years ago both of these
were restored by a very inferior master to Jacopo. For the Dyers, he
did the one at S. Nofri, on the side of their garden wall, opposite

St. Benedict, who in those days had great reputation for sanctity, he
endeavored to restore her. In the meantime, Justinian having arranged

perfection, since the accessions are so few and gradual as to preserve its
character. The American forest exhibits in the highest degree the grandeur of repose. As nature never does violence to its own laws, the soil throws out the
plant which it is best qualified to support, and the eye is not often
disappointed by a sickly vegetation. There ever seems a generous emulation
in the trees, which is not to be found among others or different
families, when left to pursue their quiet existence in the solitude of the
fields.",8888,1700s
"""[48] And the same writer, in another passage, refers to another
still more general maxim, (and a sound maxim it is,) that the power and
means of proof ought not to be narrowed, but enlarged, that the truth
may not be concealed: ""_Probationum facultas non angustari, sed ampliari
debeat, ne veritas occultetur._""[49]

On the whole, your Committee can find nothing in the writings of the
learned in this law, any more than they could discover anything in the
Law of Parliament, to support any one of the determinations given by the
Judges, and adopted by the Lords, against the evidence which your
Committee offered, whether direct and positive, or merely (as for the
greater part it was) circumstantial, and produced as a ground to form
legitimate presumption against the defendant: nor, if they were to admit
(which they do not) this Civil Law to be of authority in furnishing any
rule in an impeachment of the Commons, more than as it may occasionally
furnish a principle of reason on a new or undetermined point, do they
find any rule or any principle, derived from that law, which could or
ought to have made us keep back the evidence which we offered; on the
contrary, we rather think those rules and principles to be in agreement
with our conduct. As to the Canon Law, your Committee, finding it to have adopted the
Civil Law with no very essential variation, does not feel it necessary
to make any particular statement on that subject. Your Committee then came to examine into the authorities in the English
law, both as it has prevailed for many years back, and as it has been
recently received in our courts below. They found on the whole the rules
rather less strict, more liberal, and less loaded with positive
limitations, than in the Roman law. The origin of this latitude may
perhaps be sought in this circumstance, which we know to have relaxed
the rigor of the Roman law: courts in England do not judge upon
evidence, _secundum allegata et probata_, as in other countries and
under other laws they do, but upon verdict.",18218,1700s

"he _shall_ do it!”  The habit of
application becomes easy in time, like every other habit. Thus persons
with comparatively moderate powers will accomplish much, if they apply
themselves wholly and indefatigably to one thing at a time. Fowell
Buxton placed his confidence in ordinary means and extraordinary
application; realizing the scriptural injunction, “Whatsoever thy hand
findeth to do, do it with all thy might;” and he attributed his own
success in life to his practice of “being a whole man to one thing at a
time.”

Nothing that is of real worth can be achieved without courageous working. Man owes his growth chiefly to that active striving of the will, that
encounter with difficulty, which we call effort; and it is astonishing to
find how often results apparently impracticable are thus made possible. An intense anticipation itself transforms possibility into reality; our
desires being often but the precursors of the things which we are capable
of performing.",935,1800s

"Thy ward is higher up:  but have ye slain
  The damsel’s champion?” and the damsel cried,

     “No star of thine, but shot from Arthur’s heaven
  With all disaster unto thine and thee! For both thy younger brethren have gone down
  Before this youth; and so wilt thou, Sir Star;
  Art thou not old?”
                    “Old, damsel, old and hard,
  Old, with the might and breath of twenty boys.”
  Said Gareth, “Old, and over-bold in brag! But that same strength which threw the Morning Star
  Can throw the Evening.”

                         Then that other blew
  A hard and deadly note upon the horn. “Approach and arm me!”  With slow steps from out
  An old storm-beaten, russet, many-stained
  Pavilion, forth a grizzled damsel came,
  And armed him in old arms, and brought a helm
  With but a drying evergreen for crest,
  And gave a shield whereon the Star of Even
  Half-tarnished and half-bright, his emblem, shone. But when it glittered o’er the saddle-bow,
  They madly hurled together on the bridge;
  And Gareth overthrew him, lighted, drew,
  There met him drawn, and overthrew him again,
  But up like fire he started:  and as oft
  As Gareth brought him grovelling on his knees,
  So many a time he vaulted up again;
  Till Gareth panted hard, and his great heart,
  Foredooming all his trouble was in vain,
  Laboured within him, for he seemed as one
  That all in later, sadder age begins
  To war against ill uses of a life,
  But these from all his life arise, and cry,
  “Thou hast made us lords, and canst not put us down!”
  He half despairs; so Gareth seemed to strike
  Vainly, the damsel clamouring all the while,
  “Well done, knave-knight, well-stricken, O good knight-knave—
  O knave, as noble as any of all the knights—
  Shame me not, shame me not.",610,1800s
"One of these Kingdoms was called _Magua,_ signifying a Campaign or open
Country; which is very observable, if any place in the Universe
deserves taking notice of, and memorable for the pleasantness of its
Situation; for it is extended from South to North Eighty Miles, in
breadth Five, Eight, and in some parts Ten Miles in length; and is on
all sides inclosed with the highest Mountains; above Thirty Thousand
Rivers, and Rivulets water her Coasts, Twelve of which prodigious
Number do not yield in all in magnitude to those famous Rivers, the
_Eber, Duer,_ and _Guadalquivir;_ and all those Rivers which have their
Source or Spring from the Mountains lying Westerly, the number whereof
is Twenty Thousand) are very rich in Mines of Gold; on which Mountain
lies the Province of rich Mines, whence the exquisite Gold of Twenty
Four Caracts weight, takes denomination. The King and Lord of this
Kingdom was named _Guarionex,_ who governed within the Compass of his
Dominions so many Vassals and Potent Lords, that every one of them was
able to bring into the Field Sixteen Thousand Soldiers for the service
of _Guarionex_ their Supream Lord and Soverain, when summoned
thereunto. Some of which I was acquainted with. This was a most
Obedient Prince, endued with great Courage and Morality, naturally of a
Pacifick Temper, and most devoted to the service of the _Castilian_
Kings. This King commanded and ordered his Subjects, that every one of
those Lords under his Jurisdiction, should present him with a Bell full
of Gold; but in succeeding times, being unable to perform it, they were
commanded to cut it in two, and fill one part therewith, for the
Inhabitants of this Isle were altogether inexperienced, and unskilful
in Mine-works, and the digging Gold out of them.",20321,1400s
"There has been no grand
catastrophe--no destroyer has swept away the forms of life of one
period, and replaced them by a totally new creation; but one species
has vanished and another has taken its place; creatures of one type of
structure have diminished, those of another have increased, as time has
passed on. And thus, while the differences between the living creatures
of the time before the chalk and those of the present day appear
startling, if placed side by side, we are led from one to the other by
the most gradual progress, if we follow the course of Nature through
the whole series of those relics of her operations which she has left
behind. And it is by the population of the chalk sea that the ancient and the
modern inhabitants of the world are most completely connected. The
groups which are dying out flourish, side by side, with the groups which
are now the dominant forms of life. Thus the chalk contains remains of those strange flying and swimming
reptiles, the pterodactyl, the ichthyosaurus, and the plesiosaurus,
which are found in no later deposits, but abounded in preceding ages.",1315,1800s

On all thy works I look;

Shine brighter in thy Book. 2 The stars that in their courses roll,
Have much instruction given;
But thy good Word informs my soul
How I may climb to heaven. 3 The fields provide me food, and show
The goodness of the Lord;
But fruits of life and glory grow
In thy most holy Word. 4 Here are my choicest treasures hid,
Here my best comfort lies;
Here my desires are satisfy'd;
And hence my hopes arise. 5 Lord, make me understand thy law,
Show what my faults have been;
And from thy Gospel let me draw
Pardon for all my sin.",13439,1600s
"She was bound to make a fuss, and these fusses invariably took
the final form of a tightness of money for Bechamel. Albeit, and he
felt it was heroic of him to resolve so, it was worth doing if it was
to be done. His imagination worked on a kind of matronly Valkyrie, and
the noise of pursuit and vengeance was in the air. The idyll still had
the front of the stage. That accursed detective, it seemed, had been
thrown off the scent, and that, at any rate, gave a night’s respite.",1264,1800s

"“Yer powers wasn’t

“Don’t answer them any more!” entreated Sue. “I don’t think I like Christminster!” murmured little Time mournfully,
as he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd. But finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment,
Jude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he had
no great reason to be ashamed of; and in a little while was stimulated
to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally:

“It is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man—that
question I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing at the
present moment in these uprising times—whether to follow uncritically
the track he finds himself in, without considering his aptness for it,
or to consider what his aptness or bent may be, and re-shape his course
accordingly. I tried to do the latter, and I failed. But I don’t admit
that my failure proved my view to be a wrong one, or that my success
would have made it a right one; though that’s how we appraise such
attempts nowadays—I mean, not by their essential soundness, but by
their accidental outcomes.",153,1800s
"And Paul, 1 Cor. 11, 33, commands concerning
the Communion: Tarry one for another, so that there may be a common
participation. Forasmuch, therefore, as the Mass with us has the example of the Church,
taken from the Scripture and the Fathers, we are confident that it
cannot be disapproved, especially since public ceremonies, for the most
part like those hitherto in use, are retained; only the number of Masses
differs, which, because of very great and manifest abuses doubtless
might be profitably reduced. For in olden times, even in churches most
frequented, the Mass was not celebrated every day, as the Tripartite
History (Book 9, chap. 33) testifies: Again in Alexandria, every
Wednesday and Friday the Scriptures are read, and the doctors expound
them, and all things are done, except the solemn rite of Communion.",275,1400s
"The people
reorganized the government, and lessened the number of its officers, to
which measure they were induced by finding that the Signors appointed
from the families, of which the following were the heads, had been
favorable to the nobility, viz. : the Mancini, Magalotti, Altoviti,
Peruzzi, and Cerretani. Having settled the government, for the greater
magnificence and security of the Signory, they laid the foundation of
their palace; and to make space for the piazza, removed the houses that
had belonged to the Uberti; they also at the same period commenced the
public prisons. These buildings were completed in a few years; nor did
our city ever enjoy a greater state of prosperity than in those times:
filled with men of great wealth and reputation; possessing within her
walls 30,000 men capable of bearing arms, and in the country 70,000,
while the whole of Tuscany, either as subjects or friends, owed
obedience to Florence. And although there might be some indignation and
jealousy between the nobility and the people, they did not produce any
evil effect, but all lived together in unity and peace.",2464,1400s
"8. Wherefore we will proceed to take notice, that we also devis'd a way of
trying whether or no Metalline Solutions though one of them at least had
its Colour Adventitious, by the mixture of the _Menstruum_ employ'd to
dissolve it, might not be made to compound a Green after the manner of
other Bodies. And though this seem'd not easie to be perform'd by reason of
the Difficulty of finding Metalline Solutions of the Colour requisite, that
would mix without Præcipitating each other; yet after a while having
consider'd the matter, the first Tryal afforded me the following
Experiment. I took a High Yellow Solution of good Gold in _Aqua-Regis_,
(made of _Aqua-fortis_, and as I remember half its weight of Spirit of
Salt) To this I put a due Proportion of a deep and lovely Blew Solution of
Crude Copper, (which I have elsewhere taught to be readily Dissoluble in
strong Spirit of Urine) and these two Liquors though at first they seem'd a
little to Curdle one another, yet being throughly mingl'd by Shaking, they
presently, as had been Conjectur'd, united into a Transparent Green Liquor,
which continu'd so for divers days that I kept it in a small Glass wherein
'twas made, only letting fall a little Blackish Powder to the Bottom. The
other _Phænomena_ of this Experiment belong not to this place, where it may
suffice to take notice of the Production of a Green, and that the
Experiment was more than once repeated with Success.",14504,1600s

 they might not leave one surviving Lord or Peer in the whole Countrey. I also affirm that I saw with these Eyes of mine the _Spaniards_ for no
 other reason, but only to gratifie their bloody mindedness, cut off the
 Hands, Noses, and Ears, both of _Indians_ and _Indianesses_, and that
 in so many places and parts, that it would be too prolix and tedious to
 relate them. Nay, I have seen the _Spaniards_ let loose their Dogs
 upon the _Indians_ to bait and tear them in pieces, and such a Number
 of Villages burnt by them as cannot well be discover'd: Farther this is
 a certain Truth, that they snatched Babes from the Mothers Embraces,
 and taking hold of their Arms threw them away as far as they would from
 them: (a pretty kind of barr-tossing Recreation.) They committed many
 other Cruelties, which shook me with Terror at the very sight of them,

 _Indians_ as fill'd Three Houses, to which, for no cause, (or a very
 inconsiderable one) they set fire, and burnt every one of them: But a
 Presbyter, _Ocana_ by Name, chanced to snatch a little baby out of the
 fire, which being observ'd by a _Spaniard_, he tore him out of his
 Arms, and threw him into the midst of the Flames, where he was with the
 rest, soon burnt to Ashes, which _Spaniard_ the same day he committed

INTRODUCTION


THE APOLOGY OF THE CONFESSION. Philip Melanchthon Presents His Greeting to the Reader. Wherefore we
believe that troubles and dangers for the glory of Christ and the
good of the Church should be endured, and we are confident that this
our fidelity to duty is approved of God, and we hope that the
judgment of posterity concerning us will be more just.",6744,1400s
"For it cleaves to His promises, and
never doubts that He is true, just, and wise, and will do, dispose, and
provide for all things in the best way. Is not such a soul, in this its
faith, most obedient to God in all things? What commandment does there
remain which has not been amply fulfilled by such an obedience? What
fulfilment can be more full than universal obedience? Now this is not
accomplished by works, but by faith alone.",1911,1400s
"By addressing myself to females, I am far from inferring that charity is
exclusively their praise; no, it is a virtue as manly as it is gentle;
it is christian, in one word, and ought therefore to be universal. But
the pressure of present need is so urgent, that the ladies who patronize
this plan are content to spread it amongst their own sex, whose
contributions, though smaller, may more conveniently be sudden, and
whose demands for wealth being less serious, may render those
contributions more general[1]. Nor are the misfortunes we would now mitigate so foreign to our
""business and bosoms"" as we may lightly suppose: all Europe is involved
by the circumstances which occasioned them, and with indignation as
strong, though with sensations less acute, has watched their wonderful
progress[2]. Whatever by unbelievers may be urged in defence of what they style the
_religion of nature_, its inefficacy, even for the exclusive purposes of
morality, is now surely exposed beyond all theory or controversy: and
the _religion of God_ has received a testimony as clear of its _moral_
influence, by the atrocious acts of the Convention since it has been
cast aside, as of its _divine_, in the voluntary sacrifices offered up
at its shrine by those who still adhere to its holy doctrines. And shall we, with our arms, our treasures, our dearest blood, resist
the authors of these wrongs, yet forbear to protect their victims?",29125,1700s

things should be brought out of the treasury, as well the voice of
the law as the word of grace. The voice of the law should be brought
forward, that men may be terrified and brought to a knowledge of their
sins, and thence be converted to penitence and to a better manner of
life. But we must not stop here; that would be to wound only and not to
bind up, to strike and not to heal, to kill and not to make alive, to
bring down to hell and not to bring back, to humble and not to exalt. Therefore the word of grace and of the promised remission of sin must
also be preached, in order to teach and set up faith, since without

taught in vain.",1911,1400s

     Last night I dreamed that I was come again
     Unto the house where my beloved dwells
     After long years of wandering and pain. And I stood out beneath the drenching rain
     And all the street was bare, and black with night,
     But in my true love's house was warmth and light. Yet I could not draw near nor enter in,
     And long I wondered if some secret sin
     Or old, unhappy anger held me fast;

     Till suddenly it came into my head
     That I was killed long since and lying dead--
     Only a homeless wraith that way had passed. So thus I found my true love's house again
     And stood unseen amid the winter night
     And the lamp burned within, a rosy light,
     And the wet street was shining in the rain.",2003,1800s

CHAP. V.

_Of the Fracture of the Ribs._

When a Rib is broken, one of the ends pusheth into the Breast, sometimes on
the outside; and sometimes the Ends lie against each other. In order to
reduce it, the Patient being laid upon the sound Rib, a Plaister of Mastick
is apply'd to the Fracture; and it is drawn out violently; so that
sometimes this Attraction brings back the Bone, which is advanc'd into the
Breast; but the surest way is to make an Incision therein, to raise it up
with the Finger. If the Rib appear without, the Patient is to be set in a a Chair, and
oblig'd to bend his Body on the side opposite to the Fracture, holding his
Breath, with which he must puff strongly, without letting it forth, in
order to dilate the Breast, whilst the Surgeon thrusts the Rib into its
place. {280}

_The Dressing and Bandage._

A Bolster is to be apply'd to the Fracture, with two little Pieces of
Paste-board pass'd in form of a St. _Andrew's_ Cross; and another Bolster
upon the whole Dressing, on which is also laid a large square Paste-board
cover'd with a Bolster.",34157,1600s

with Scipio, on the terms he himself had prescribed. They then delivered
up to him more than five hundred ships, all which he burnt in sight of
Carthage; a lamentable spectacle to the inhabitants of that ill-fated

"The most conspicuous general phenomenon in the countries here
included is _the steadiness of the gravest forms of crime side by
side with the continuous increase of slighter offences_,
especially in the countries which show a long series of figures,
such as France, England, and Belgium. This proceeds mainly from
the progressive accumulation of offences against special
enactments, which are constantly being added to the original basis
of the penal code; but it is also a symptom of an actual
transformation in the criminal activity of the century, from
whence, through the gradual substitution of crimes against
property in the great towns for crimes against the person in
earlier centuries, we have a wider extension together with a lower
degree of intensity. <p 64>

Another characteristic common to the countries under observation
is that, whilst the graver crimes against property show a somewhat
marked diminution, crimes against persons, on the other hand, show
more steadiness, either of regularity, as in France and Belgium,
or of increase, as in England, and still more in Germany. But
this phenomenon in the case of crimes against the person is in
actual correspondence with criminal activity arising from an
increase of population. On the other hand--apart from the
transformation of crimes of violence into crimes of craft and
fraud, due to the increase of movable property--the decrease of
offences against property is no more than the manifest effect of
an artificial change of judicial procedure, summary proceedings
taking the place of trial by jury.",477,1800s

knights, and Doctors of Divinity, Law, and Medicine so that their
""several worths and degrees"" might be recognized when their names were
inserted on the patents. Surgeons received no mention. On the other hand, physicians and surgeons in England might well have

best of our knowledge, was introduced from England into the American

a century. Likewise Transitional are certain early Virginia homes with

of the house is exactly balanced by low end pavilions--each surmounted

Some people are born with a vital and responsive energy. It not only
enables them to keep abreast of the times; it qualifies them to furnish
in their own personality a good bit of the motive power to the mad

they fall out of rank and sink by the wayside to be left contemplating

"MOST EXCELLENT SIR,

   Since I had the honour of writing to your
   Excellency, Pedro José de Costa Barros, who arrived from Cearà
   with the intention to take upon himself the office of President
   here--has unfortunately been the occasion of stirring up old
   animosities, which I had hoped experience might have taught him
   the advantage of leaving dormant. Had Barros been provided
   with proper authority under the sign manual of His Imperial
   Majesty, the difficulties that have occurred since his arrival might
   have been prevented; though I am extremely apprehensive that if
   ever he shall be invested with such authority, still greater evils will
   befal the province. The Portuguese party are in favour of Barros,
   and have expressed their sentiments unequivocally, and this your
   Excellency knows is sufficient to raise up the native Brazilians
   against him. The Portuguese and some others had combined to place Barros
   in the Presidency by force, which intention I happily frustrated by
   arriving in Maranham with a considerable reinforcement from the
   _Pedro Primiero_, at midnight--when the attempt was to have
   occurred. To put a stop to proceedings so injurious to the interests
   of His Imperial Majesty and the public, I have felt it necessary to
   remove Barros from Maranham until his commission shall arrive,
   or until His Majesty's pleasure respecting the appointment of
   Manoel Telles da Silva Lobo, shall be known.",14479,1700s

"He utterly destroy'd that Land, which the rest of the
_Spaniards_ took very unkindly at his Hands, who frequently playd the
Pirate, and rob'd on that shore, detesting it as a wicked thing,
because they had lost that place, where they use to be treated with as
great Hospitality and Freedom, as if they had been under their own
Roof: Nay they transported from this place, among them, to the Isles of
_Hispaniola_ and St. _John_ Two Millions of Men and upward, and made
the Coast a Desert. It is most certainly true, that they never ship off a Vessel freighted
with _Indians_, but they pay a third part as Tribute to the Sea,
besides those who are slaughter'd, when found in their own Houses. Now
the Soarce and Original of all this is the ends they have propos'd to
themselves. For there is a necessity of taking with them a great
number of _Indians_, that they may gain a great sum of Mony by their
Sale, now the Ships are very slenderly furnished with Provisions and
Water in small Quantity, to satisfie few, left the Tyrants, who are
term'd Owners or Proprietors of Ships should be at too great expence in
Victualling their Vessels, nay they scarce carry Food enough with them
to maintain the _Spaniards_ that manage the Vessel, which is the reason
so many _Indians_ dye with Hunger and Thirst, and of necessity they
must be thrown over-board: Nay one of them told me this for a Truth,
that there being such a Multitude of Men thus destroy'd, a Ship may
sail from the Isle of _Lucaya_ to _Hispaniola_, which is a Voyage of
Twenty Leagues and upward, without Chart or Compass, by the sole
Direction or Observation of dead fluctuating Carkasses. But afterward, when arriv'd, and driven up into the Isle whither they
are brought to be sold, there is no Person that is in some small

to the singular disclosure of him whom they still only knew as Frank
Halloway, ""this language cannot be permitted; you must confine yourself
to your defence."" ""Pardon me, gentlemen,"" returned Halloway, in his usual firm but
respectful tone of voice; ""pardon me, if, standing on the brink of the
grave as I do, I have so far forgotten the rules of military discipline
as to sink for a moment the soldier in the gentleman; but to be taxed
with an unworthy fabrication, and to be treated with contumely when
avowing the secret of my condition, was more than human pride and human
feeling could tolerate."" ""Confine yourself, prisoner, to your defence,"" again remarked Captain
Blessington, perceiving the restlessness with which the governor
listened to these bold and additional observations of Halloway. Again the governor interposed:--""What possible connexion can there be

"Easy to me it is to tell thee all
What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:
I was at first as other beasts that graze
The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,
As was my food; nor aught but food discerned
Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:
Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced
A goodly tree far distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,
Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,
Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense
Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats
Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,
Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. To satisfy the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved
Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,
Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent
Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;
For, high from ground, the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or Adam’s: Round the tree
All other beasts that saw, with like desire
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,
At feed or fountain, never had I found. Sated at length, ere long I might perceive
Strange alteration in me, to degree
Of reason in my inward powers; and speech
Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.",26,1600s

morning he made her accept _his_ “terms”—the necessity of his making his
case known to Morgan. She had felt no resentment after seeing there was
no danger Morgan would take the matter up with her. Indeed, attributing
this immunity to the good taste of his influence with the boy, she had
once said to Pemberton “My dear fellow, it’s an immense comfort you’re a
gentleman.”  She repeated this in substance now. “Of course you’re a
gentleman—that’s a bother the less!”  Pemberton reminded her that he had
not “dragged in” anything that wasn’t already in as much as his foot was

colorful and impressive and exotic to others, and she wondered if it was
all really as ridiculous as it seemed to her. She lay there in the dark of the room as evening reached over the dead
sea bottom toward the edifice that was Martian Haven. Out there in the
big amphitheatre, resurrected supposedly from old Martian ruins, Martian
Haven, with all of its rich, efficient facilities and staff, was
preparing the stage, props and guests for the Love Ritual of the Double
Moons. The core and centerpiece of Martian Haven was a great cubistic hotel,
with the two Martian canals on two sides, renovated, of course, and a
five-mile-long artificial lake on a third side. It was somehow designed,
in the middle of all that vast emptiness of dead sea, sand and eroded
rock, to have a not-ungraceful look of insubstantiality, as though at

At that I turned tail upon their boat (where my adviser had once more

creek; and, sure enough, it was shrunk into a little trickle of water,
through which I dashed, not above my knees, and landed with a shout on
the main island. A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only
what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can
be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod,

sail, and the lower for working the cables. The guns on these decks were
not primed until the ship had anchored. But the Algerines reserved their
fire, confident in the strength of their defences, and expecting to
carry the flagship by boarding her from the gun-boats, which were all

"6. In all cases of the substitution of the second for the principal,
the seconds should interpose and adjust the matter, if the party
substituting avows he does not make the quarrel of his principal
his own. The true reason for substitution, is the supposed insult of
imputing to you the like inequality which if charged upon your friend,
and when the contrary is declared, there should be no fight, for
individuals may well differ in their estimate of an individual's
character and standing in society. In case of substitution and a
satisfactory arrangement, you are then to inform your friend of all the
facts, whose duty it will be to post in person. 7.",6085,1700s
"Against Mrs.
Casey (the renowned Matty Dwyer) she entertained an especial spite, in
consideration of her treatment of her beautiful boy and her own pair
of black eyes; so she determined to “pay her off” in her own way, and
stopping one day at the hole in the hedge which served for entrance to
the estate of the “three-cornered field,” she sent the footman in to say
the _dowjer_ Lady Scatter_breen_ wanted to speak with “Casey's wife.”

When the servant, according to instructions, delivered this message, he
was sent back with the answer, “that if any lady wanted to see Casey's
wife, 'Casey's wife,' was at home.”

“Oh, go back, and tell the poor woman I don't want to bring her to the
door of my carriage, if it's inconvaynient. I only wished to give her
a little help; and tell her if she sends up eggs to the big house, Lady
Scatterbreen will pay her for them.”

When the servant delivered this message, Matty grew outrageous at the
means “my lady” took of crowing over her, and rushing to the door, with
her face flushed with rage, roared out, “Tell the old baggage I want
none of her custom; let her lay eggs for herself.”

The servant staggered back in amaze; and Matty, feeling he would not
deliver her message, ran to the hole in the hedge and repeated her
answer to my lady herself, with a great deal more which need not be
recorded. Suffice it to say, my lady thought it necessary to pull up the
glass, against which Matty threw a handful of mud; the servant jumped up
on his perch behind the carriage, which was rapidly driven away by the
coachman, but not so fast that Matty could not, by dint of running, keep
it “within range” for some seconds, during which time she contrived to
pelt both coachman and footman with mud, and leave her mark on their
new livery. This was a salutary warning to the old woman, who was more
cautious in her demonstrations of grandeur for the future. If she was
stinted in the enjoyment of her new-born dignity abroad, she could
indulge it at home without let or hindrance, and to this end asked Andy
to let her have a hundred pounds, in one-pound notes, for a particular
purpose.",7180,1700s
"He dismissed it from his mind,
and after what seemed an eternity, his feet touched the hull of the

"I say, George,
catch the Pope of Rome trying to curry favour with anybody he robs; catch
old Mumbo Jumbo currying favour with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Dean and Chapter, should he meet them in a stage-coach; it would be with
him, Bricconi Abbasso, as he knocked their teeth out with the butt of his
trombone; and the old regular-built ruffian would be all the safer for
it, as Bill would say, as ten to one the Archbishop and Chapter, after
such a spice of his quality, would be afraid to swear against him, and to
hang him, even if he were in their power, though that would be the proper
way; for, if it is the greatest of all humbug for a highwayman to curry
favour with those he robs, the next greatest is to try to curry favour
with a highwayman when you have got him, by letting him off."" Finding the old man so well acquainted with the history of highwaymen,
and taking considerable interest in the subject, having myself edited a
book containing the lives of many remarkable people who had figured on
the highway, I forthwith asked him how it was that the trade of
highwaymen had become extinct in England, as at present we never heard of
any one following it. Whereupon he told me that many causes had
contributed to bring about that result; the principal of which were the
following:--the refusal to license houses which were known to afford
shelter to highwaymen, which, amongst many others, had caused the inn at
Hounslow to be closed; the inclosure of many a wild heath in the country,
on which they were in the habit of lurking, and particularly the
establishing in the neighbourhood of London of a well-armed mounted
patrol, who rode the highwaymen down, and delivered them up to justice,
which hanged them without ceremony. ""And that would be the way to deal with Mumbo Jumbo and his gang,"" said
the postillion, ""should they show their visages in these realms; and I
hear by the newspapers that they are becoming every day more desperate. Take away the license from their public-houses, cut down the rookeries
and shadowy old avenues in which they are fond of lying in wait, in order
to sally out upon people as they pass in the roads; but, above all,
establish a good mounted police to ride after the ruffians and drag them
by the scruff of the neck to the next clink, where they might lie till
they could be properly dealt with by law; instead of which, the
Government are repealing the wise old laws enacted against such
characters, giving fresh licenses every day to their public-houses, and
saying that it would be a pity to cut down their rookeries and thickets
because they look so very picturesque; and, in fact, giving them all kind
of encouragement; why, if such behaviour is not enough to drive an honest
man mad, I know not what is.",422,1800s
"I am too weak to wish to see my cousin now. It would but discompose me,

"All the disputes that have
ever prevailed and still prevail in the philosophical world respecting
the conception of beauty have no other origin than their commencing
without a sufficiently strict distinction, or that it is not carried out
fully to a pure union. Those philosophers who blindly follow their
feeling in reflecting on this topic can obtain no other conception of
beauty, because they distinguish nothing separate in the totality of the
sensuous impression. Other philosophers, who take the understanding as
their exclusive guide, can never obtain a conception of beauty, because
they never see anything else in the whole than the parts; and spirit and
matter remain eternally separate, even in their most perfect unity. The
first fear to suppress beauty dynamically, that is, as a working power,
if they must separate what is united in the feeling. The others fear to
suppress beauty logically, that is, as a conception, when they have to
hold together what in the understanding is separate.",6798,1700s

"The Marquise de Thianges, whose ideas regarding such matters were
precisely the same as my own, confined herself to stating that I had not

not of such difficulty that I needed any one to help me. On the twelfth day, as we were about to leave Fontevrault, I received
another letter from the King, which was as follows:

As the pain in your knee continues, and the Bourbonne waters have been
recommended to you, I beg you, madame, to profit by being in their
vicinity, and to go and try their effect. Mademoiselle de Nantes is in

"It is very true that the antipathies between the
prevailing factions may have excited Lord Middleton's anger; but it is
evident, from his lordship's letters and memoranda, that his dislike had
a far deeper source--the profligacy of the agent Lovat; a profligacy
which had deterred, as it was afterwards found, many of the Highland
chiefs from lending their aid to the cause. Party fury, however, ran
high, and before the affair of the insurrection could be settled, Lord
Middleton, declaring that the last words of King James had made a
powerful impression on his mind, retired into the convent of
Benedictines at Paris, to be satisfied of some doubts, and to be
instructed in the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. But this
temporary retirement rather revived than decreased the favour of the
Queen towards him. She trusted to his advice; and, as the statement
which Lord Lovat gave of the affairs of Scotland appeared too favourable
to the excluded family to be believed, Louis the Fourteenth counselled
the Court of St. Germains to send with Lord Lovat, or, as he is
invariably called in all contemporary documents, Simon Fraser, a person
who could be trusted to bring back a genuine account. Accordingly, James
Murray of Stanhope, the brother of Sir David Murray, was employed to
this effect.",20947,1700s
"9). Now what is done by this one precept
is done by all; for all are equally impossible of fulfilment by us. Now when a man has through the precepts been taught his own impotence,
and become anxious by what means he may satisfy the law--for the
law must be satisfied, so that no jot or tittle of it may pass away,
otherwise he must be hopelessly condemned--then, being truly humbled and
brought to nothing in his own eyes, he finds in himself no resource for
justification and salvation. Then comes in that other part of Scripture, the promises of God, which
declare the glory of God, and say, ""If you wish to fulfil the law, and,
as the law requires, not to covet, lo! believe in Christ, in whom are
promised to you grace, justification, peace, and liberty.""",1911,1400s
"In other persons grosser vices manifest themselves. But
since Christ was given to us to remove both these sins and these
punishments, and to destroy the kingdom of the devil, sin and death,
it will not be possible to recognize the benefits of Christ unless we
understand our evils. For this reason our preachers have diligently
taught concerning these subjects, and have delivered nothing that is
new but have set forth Holy Scripture and the judgments of the holy
Fathers. We think that this will satisfy His Imperial Majesty concerning the
puerile and trivial sophistry with which the adversaries have
perverted our article. For we know that we believe aright and in
harmony with the Church catholic of Christ.",6744,1400s

"To corrupt the Blood of a whole _Family_, and send
_all_ the Offspring a begging after the Father's Head is taken off,
seems a strange Piece of Severity, fit to be redressed in Parliament;
especially when we come to consider, for what Crime this has been
commonly done. When Subjects take Arms against their _Prince_, if their
Attempt succeeds, 'tis a _Revolution_; if not, 'tis call'd a
_Rebellion_: 'tis seldom consider'd, whether the first Motives be just
or unjust. Now is it not enough, in such Cases, for the prevailing Party
to hang or behead the _Offenders_, if they can catch them, without
extending the Punishment to _innocent Persons_ for _all Generations_ to
come? The Sense of this made the late _Bill of Treasons_ (tho it reach'd not
so far as many wou'd have had it) a Favourite of the _Old Whigs_; they
thought it a very desirable one whenever it cou'd be compass'd, and
perhaps if not at that very Juncture, wou'd not have been obtained all:
'twas necessary for Two different Sorts of People to unite in this, in
order for a Majority, whose Weight shou'd be sufficient to enforce it. And I think some _Whigs_ were very unjustly reproach'd by their
_Brethren_, as if by voting for this Bill, they wilfully exposed the
late _King's_ Person to the wicked Designs of his Enemies.",17894,1500s

"For this reason I have endeavoured frequently to join a Teutonick
and Roman interpretation, as to cheer, to gladden, or exhilarate,
that every learner of English may be assisted by his own tongue. The solution of all difficulties, and the supply of all defects,
must be sought in the examples, subjoined to the various senses of
each word, and ranged according to the time of their authours. When first I collected these authorities, I was desirous that every
quotation should be useful to some other end than the illustration
of a word; I therefore extracted from philosophers principles of
science; from historians remarkable facts; from chymists complete
processes; from divines striking exhortations; and from poets beautiful
descriptions. Such is design, while it is yet at a distance from
execution. When the time called upon me to range this accumulation
of elegance and wisdom into an alphabetical series, I soon discovered
that the bulk of my volumes would fright away the student, and was
forced to depart from my scheme of including all that was pleasing or
useful in English literature, and reduce my transcripts very often
to clusters of words, in which scarcely any meaning is retained; thus
to the weariness of copying, I was condemned to add the vexation

the Blood and the Humours must necessarily partake of the Benefit, and
soon discover it by the Increase of their Heat and Motion. There is so
much of a Relative Nature in every thing, that can concern the Health
or Distemperature of the Individual, that there is scarce any thing so
prejudicial, or seemingly Absurd, but may in different Circumstances
prove as Advantageous. The World has lately had full Evidence of the
good Effects of an Intense Cold, equally apply’d to all the Parts of
the Body at once, which Method of Curing would, not many Years agoe,
have been thought very Extravagant, and certainly Destructive. On the
contrary, there are other Cases, where a Warm Bath is only prevalent; and
though some People have suppos’d it to be only a kind of a last Resort,
when other things have been try’d in Vain, yet it is quite otherwise,
it being impossible to remove some Diseases of the Limbs, without an
universal equal Relaxation. Again, quite different from this is the equal
Distribution of a greater Degree of Heat throughout the whole Body, which
is procur’d by Habitual Exercise; in the former Method, the Parts are
relax’d, in this they are strengthned, and in every Respect the Effects
are widely different, tho’ in both ways there is a considerable Encrease

the arid region. It not only deceives the eye as to distance, but also
as to motion. If the eye is steadily fixed upon some distant inanimate
object, it seems to move in the tremulous light as if possessed of
life, and it is not always easy to be convinced to the contrary. However, by putting the object under inspection in line with some

"His presence would
have saved his exchequer thousands had he been nothing more than an
economical despot; and even had he been less, the awe of his person
would have preserved a territory which was lost through hatred and
contempt for his instruments. In the same manner, as the oppression of the people of the Netherlands
excited the sympathy of all who valued their own rights, it might have
been expected that their disobedience and defection would have been a
call to all princes to maintain their own prerogatives in the case of
their neighbors. But jealousy of Spain got the better of political
sympathies, and the first powers of Europe arranged themselves more or
less openly on the side of freedom. Although bound to the house of Spain by the ties of relationship, the
Emperor Maximilian II. gave it just cause for its charge against him
of secretly favoring the rebels.",6776,1700s
"The president accepted the Marquis’s sword: he staid a few minutes to see
it deposited in the archives of his house—and departed. The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Martinico,
and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to
business, with some unlook’d for bequests from distant branches of his
house, return home to reclaim his nobility, and to support it. It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any
traveller but a Sentimental one, that I should be at Rennes at the very
time of this solemn requisition: I call it solemn;—it was so to me. The Marquis entered the court with his whole family: he supported his
lady,—his eldest son supported his sister, and his youngest was at the
other extreme of the line next his mother;—he put his handkerchief to his
face twice.—

—There was a dead silence. When the Marquis had approached within six
paces of the tribunal, he gave the Marchioness to his youngest son, and
advancing three steps before his family,—he reclaim’d his sword.",804,1700s
"And old Sword then
          First knew the might of great Captain Pen. So strangely it bow'd him, so wilder'd his brain,

          'Twixt wonder and patience went lifting his brow. Then suddenly came he, with gowned men,

Miss Innes.”

“I was crying,” Gertrude said in a low tone. “When the French clock in
the drawing-room struck three, I got up, and then—I heard a step on the
east porch, just outside the card-room. Some one with a key was working
with the latch, and I thought, of course, of Halsey. When we took the
house he called that his entrance, and he had carried a key for it ever
since. The door opened and I was about to ask what he had forgotten,
when there was a flash and a report.",434,1800s
"Thus at Nordkirchen and Südkirchen (_north and south church_)
the court was held in the churchyard; at Dortmund, in the market-place
close by the town-house. But the favourite place for holding these
courts was the neighbourhood of trees, as in the olden time: and we read
of the tribunal at Arensberg in the orchard; of another under the
hawthorn; of a third under the pear-tree; of a fourth under the linden,
and so on. We also find the courts denominated simply from the trees by
which they were held, such as the tribunal at the elder, that at the
broad oak, &c.

The idea of their being held at night is also utterly devoid of proof,
no mention of any such practice being found in any of the remaining
documents. It is much more analogous to Germanic usage to infer that, as
the Public Court, and the German courts in general, were held in the
morning, soon after the break of day, such was also the rule with the
Secret Court. When an affair was brought before a Fehm-court, the first point to be
determined was whether it was a matter of Fehm-jurisdiction.",38785,1700s

"They had all risen
to be distinguished soldiers; they had all done deeds of great heroism;
they had all combined with their valour and self-devotion a serene
cheerfulness, a quiet modesty, and a truly Christian spirit; and they had
all been educated in one school—Harvard University. Gentlemen, nothing was more remarkable in these fine descendants of our
forefathers than the invincible determination with which they fought
against odds, and the undauntable spirit with which they resisted defeat. I ask you, who will say after last Friday that Harvard University is less
true to herself in peace than she was in war? I ask you, who will not
recognise in her boat’s crew the leaven of her soldiers, and who does not
feel that she has now a greater right than ever to be proud of her sons,
and take these sons to her breast when they return with resounding
acclamations? It is related of the Duke of Wellington that he once told
a lady who foolishly protested that she would like to see a great victory
that there was only one thing worse than a great victory, and that was a
great defeat.",824,1800s
"Step by Step we still attend her; turn
with the Horses as they take the Bye-road to _Harlow-place_; start with
the wretched, guilty Family, at the first Stroke of the mournful tolling
Bell; are fixed in Amazement with the lumbering heavy Noise of the Herse
up the paved inner Court-yard: But when the Servant comes in to acquaint
the Family with its Arrival, and we read this Line, _He spoke not, he
could not speak; he looked, he bowed, and withdrew_, we catch the
Servant's silent Grief; our Words are choaked, and our Sensations grow
too strong for Utterance. The awful Respect paid to _Clarissa's_ Memory
by those Persons, who generally both rejoice and mourn in Noise and
Clamour, is inimitably beautiful. But even in this solemn Scene the
Author has not forgot the Characters of the principal Actors in it: For
the barbarous Wretches who could drive _Clarissa_ from her native Home,
and by their Cruelty hurl her to Destruction, could not shed Tears for
her Loss, without mingled Bitterness, and sharp-cutting Recriminations
on each other; every one striving to rid themselves of the painful Load,
and to throw it doubly on their former Companions in Guilt. The Mother
only, as she was the least guilty, deplores the heavy Loss with soft
melting Tears, and lets Self-accusations flow from her trembling Lips. On the Arrival of Miss _Howe_, we turn from the slow moving Herse, to
the rapid Chariot-wheels that fly to bring the warm Friend, all glowing
with the most poignant lively Grief, to mourn her lost _Clarissa_.",27744,1700s

"_Quicksilver is changed by simple Distillation._


_The Operation._

18 Ounces of Quicksilver, Weight of _Amsterdam_, I forced by a
Sand-Heat, out of a pure Glass Retort, into the Receiver that was filled
with the purest Water, 4 Inches high from the Bottom: This I continued
to do till there was no more running Mercury left in the Belly of the
Vessel. I dried and cleaned the Mercury with clean dry blotting Paper,
till it was perfectly dry, cleaned from any Dirt that might have fallen
in, and from the Black which in distilling is raised every time with
the Mercury as it distills: Then I poured this Mercury into another
Retort, and forced it again as before. This I repeated in the same manner
52 times. In each Distillation there was produced in the Retort a red
shining Powder. _The Effect._

There was then four Drams and a half after 52 Distillations of a sharp,
red, shining Powder, purging upwards and downwards: There remained 16
Ounces and 5 Drachms of Quicksilver; so 6½ Drachms were lost.",63318,1600s

"You will
remember, Sir, that the royal cells are of a pyramidal form, with a wide
base, and a long contracted top. These cells hang perpendicularly in the
hive, the point downwards, from which position the royal worm can be
supported in the cell, only when the curvature of the posterior part
forms two points of support; and that it cannot obtain this support
without resting on the lower part, or towards the extremity. Therefore
if it attempted to stretch out and spin towards the wide end of the
cell, it could not reach both sides from being too distant. One part
would be touched by its extremity, the other by its back, and it would
consequently tumble down. I have particularly ascertained the fact in
glass cells that were too large, and of which the diameter was greater
towards the point than is usual in cells; there they were unable to
support themselves.",26457,1700s

being mean and cruel. Are you not tired of the taste, Nicholas Snyders?",869,1800s
"The King could not but find this reflection of his son very silly and out
of place. But intelligence is neither to be given nor communicated by
example. His Majesty had to support to the end this son, legitimate as
much as you like, but altogether in degree, and with a person which
formed a perpetual contrast with the person of the King. It was my Duc
du Maine who should have been in the eminent position of Monseigneur. Nature willed it so.",3851,1600s

"I think there never was
a more wrong-headed man or a man more radically dishonest, even to the
marrow of his bones. As for Marsin, he died soon after his capture, from
the effect of his wounds. CHAPTER XXXVI

Such was our military history of the year 1706--history of losses and
dishonour. It may be imagined in what condition was the exchequer with
so many demands upon its treasures. For the last two or three years the
King had been obliged, on account of the expenses of the war, and the
losses we had sustained, to cut down the presents that he made at the
commencement of the year.",3864,1600s
"I returned home covered with academical laurels, and fraught with
criticism and philosophy. The wit and the scholar excited curiosity, and
my acquaintance was solicited by innumerable invitations. To please will
always be the wish of benevolence, to be admired must be the constant
aim of ambition; and I therefore considered myself as about to receive
the reward of my honest labours, and to find the efficacy of learning
and of virtue. The third day after my arrival I dined at the house of a gentleman who
had summoned a multitude of his friends to the annual celebration of his
wedding-day. I set forward with great exultation, and thought myself
happy that I had an opportunity of displaying my knowledge to so
numerous an assembly.",11397,1700s

"Fever and gout at last attacked him, and
he augmented them by the course he pursued. Finot, our physician and
his, at times knew not what to do with him. What embarrassed Finot most,
as he related to us more than once, was that M. le Prince would eat
nothing, for the simple reason, as he alleged, that he was dead, and that
dead men did not eat! It was necessary, however, that he should take
something, or he would have really died. Finot, and another doctor who
attended him, determined to agree with him that he was dead, but to
maintain that dead men sometimes eat.",3866,1600s

Confusion and riots in the city--Reform of government in opposition to

di Lando banished--Benedetto Alberti hated by the Signory--Fears
excited by the coming of Louis of Anjou--The Florentines purchase
Arezzo--Benedetto Alberti becomes suspected and is banished--His
discourse upon leaving the city--Other citizens banished and
admonished--War with Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan. The death of Giorgio caused very great excitement; many took arms at
the execution in favor of the Signory and the Capitano; and many others,
either for ambition or as a means for their own safety, did the same. The city was full of conflicting parties, who each had a particular end
in view, and wished to carry it into effect before they disarmed. The
ancient nobility, called the GREAT, could not bear to be deprived
of public honors; for the recovery of which they used their utmost
exertions, and earnestly desired that authority might be restored to the
Capitani di Parte. The nobles of the people and the major trades were
discontented at the share the minor trades and lowest of the people

increasing their influence, and the lowest people were apprehensive
of losing the companies of their trades and the authority which these
conferred.",2464,1400s

"4). Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the
soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which
none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is
rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of
light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of
wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is

"They also erected
Temples and Houses for them and they were desired to come to other
Provinces and Preach the Gospel, and introduce them into the knowledge
of God, and the Great (as they stiled him) King of _Castile_: And the
Priests perswasions wrought so effectually on them, that they
condescended to that which was never done in _India_ before (for
whatsoever those Tyrants who wasted and consumed these large Kingdoms
and Provinces, did misrepresent and falsifie, was only done to bring an
odium and disgrace upon the _Indians_). For Twelve or Fifteen Princes
of spatious and well-peopled Regions assembled, every one distinct and
separate from the rest, with his own subjects, and by their unanimous
consent upon Council and Advice, of their own accord sumitted
themselves to the Government of the _Castilian_ Kings and accepted of
them as their Prince and Protector, obliging themselves to obey and
serve them as subjects to their Lawful Liege Lord. In Witness whereof I have in my custody, a certain Instrument Signed
and Attested by the aforesaid Religioso's. Thus to the great joy and hope of these Priests reducing them to the
knowledge of Christ they were received by the Inhabitants of this
Kingdom, that surviv'd the heat and rage of the Spanish Cruelties: but
behold eighteen Horse and Twelve Footmen by another way crept in among
them, bringing with them many Idols, which were of great weight, and
taken out of other Regions by Force. The Commander in chief of these
_Spaniards_ summoned one of the Dynasts or Rulers of that Province
which they entred into, to appear before him, and command him to take
these Idols with him, distribute them through his Countrey and exchange
every single Idol for an _Indian_ Man or Woman, otherwise he would make
War against him.",20321,1400s
"I put my hand through the grates
and took my fathers, and held it fast. The poor old gentleman shed many
tears and seemed quite troubled to see me in so woeful a place. He asked
me how I did I told him poorly but as well as could be expected in such a
hidious place, I then asked after the health of Mother Brother & Sisters,
he told me they were well. I was filled with joy at hearing this as it was
the first time I had heard from them since I entered the service. He asked
me ""what I thought of myself now and why I could not have been ruled by
him, he said he had forewarned me of the cost, and that I had been led
away by a bad man (Dr Latham) and that Washington's whole crew would soon
be in the same situation"" and says he, ""did not you never see his
excellency's proclamation, whare in was set forth a free grace and pardon
to all who would come in voluntarely"" (Meaning Sir Wm Hows Proclamation) I
told him I had seen it, says he ""why then did you not come in then,
voluntarely, and quit the rebels.",37035,1700s
"We did not forget to make a hollow round it, but the
difficulty was how to procure a supply of water, which was brought from a
considerable distance, and we not permitted to fetch it: but water was
absolutely necessary for our willow, and we made use of every stratagem
to obtain it. For a few days everything succeeded so well that it began to bud, and
throw out small leaves, which we hourly measured convinced (tho' now
scarce a foot from the ground) it would soon afford us a refreshing
shade. This unfortunate willow, by engrossing our whole time, rendered
us incapable of application to any other study, and the cause of our
inattention not being known, we were kept closer than before. The fatal
moment approached when water must fail, and we were already afflicted
with the idea that our tree must perish with drought. At length
necessity, the parent of industry, suggested an invention, by which we
might save our tree from death, and ourselves from despair; it was to
make a furrow underground, which would privately conduct a part of the
water from the walnut tree to our willow.",3901,1700s

other than those which he has imposed either by his own authority or by
that of the Canons. 6. The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring that it has
been remitted by God and by assenting to God's remission; though, to be
sure, he may grant remission in cases reserved to his judgment. If his
right to grant remission in such cases were despised, the guilt would
remain entirely unforgiven.",274,1400s

LETTER OF MARTIN LUTHER TO POPE LEO X. Among those monstrous evils of this age with which I have now for three
years been waging war, I am sometimes compelled to look to you and to
call you to mind, most blessed father Leo.",1911,1400s
"And politics must be served, just as it was served
in my grandfather’s day and at every other time since man first knew the
taste of power. The same hypocritical public behavior, the same affected
virtues propped right alongside the same winked-at corruption.” She
swung her legs around and stood up. “But enough of this speech-making. I’m going to bring us some of the Campania.”

She returned with the wine on a silver tray and handed him one of the
two slender goblets. He held the glass up to the light and slowly
revolved its gracefully thin stem between his thumb and forefinger.",52650,1900s
"And a cheap world cruise ticket. As if there were any spot on this
world I could still want to see."" He laughed harshly. ""Forgive me if I
sound bitter. But, you see, I've never been off Earth!""",50876,1900s
"He
was strenuously supported by Mr. Burke, Mr. Martin, and other respectable
members. At length, the debate ended in favour of the original motion, and
a committee was appointed accordingly. The examinations began again on February the seventh, and continued till
April the fifth, when they were finally closed. In this, as in the former
session, Mr. Wilberforce and Mr. William Smith principally conducted them;
and indeed it was necessary that they should have been present at these
times; for it is perhaps difficult to conceive the illiberal manner, in
which our witnesses were treated by those on the other side of the
question. Men, who had left the trade upon principle, and who had come
forward, against their apparent interest, to serve the cause of humanity
and justice, were looked upon as mercenaries and culprits, or as men of
doubtful and suspicious character.",12507,1700s
"11. If you would keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, be
mindful, that the God whom you serve is a God of peace, and your Saviour
is a Prince of peace, and that “his ways are ways of pleasantness, and
all his paths are peace;” and that Christ was sent into the world “to
give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, and
to guide our feet in the way of peace.”

12. Consider the oneness of spirit that is among the enemies of
religion; though they differ about other things, yet to persecute
religion, and extirpate religion out of the earth, here they will agree;
the devils in the air, and the devils in the earth, all the devils in
hell, and in the world, make one at this turn. Shall the devil’s kingdom
be united; and shall Christ’s be divided? Shall the devils make one
shoulder to drive on the design of damning men, and shall not Christians
unite to carry on the great design of saving of them?",3614,1600s
"But
they also were alarmed, the marquis of Mantua having abandoned them and
gone over to the duke; and thus, finding themselves almost defenseless,
they replied, ""that instead of increasing their responsibilities, they
should be unable to perform their part in the war, unless the Count
Francesco were sent to them to take the command of the army, and with
the special understanding that he should engage to cross the Po in
person. They declined to fulfil their former engagements unless he were
bound to do so; for they could not carry on the war without a leader,
or repose confidence in any except the count; and he himself would be
useless to them, unless he came under an obligation to carry on the
war whenever they might think needful."" The Florentines thought the war
ought to be pushed vigorously in Lombardy; but they saw that if they
lost the count their enterprise against Lucca was ruined; and they knew
well that the demand of the Venetians arose less from any need they had
of the count, than from their desire to frustrate this expedition. The
count, on the other hand, was ready to pass into Lombardy whenever
the league might require him, but would not alter the tenor of his
engagement; for he was unwilling to sacrifice the hope of the alliance
promised to him by the duke. The Florentines were thus embarrassed by two contrary impulses, the
wish to possess Lucca, and the dread of a war with Milan.",2464,1400s
"""Then why allow your personal feelings to interfere with the deal?"" ""I have no intention of doing so,"" Mr. Parker answered. ""Then if you'll give your approval, we'll sign the final papers tomorrow
at my office. The dedication of the new camp has been set for the tenth
of the month, and that means no time can be lost."" ""Everything seems to have been settled without my approval,"" Mr. Parker
said, smiling.",34403,1900s
"As soon as his
cousins were helped to what they liked best, his mamma said, 'What will
you eat first, Alfred, my love? A wing of a chicken?' 'No,' said Alfred,
pushing it away. 'A slice of ham, darling?' said nurse.",29360,1700s

"""I hope so,"" he said. But nobody in particular
heard him. III

A Volta two-wheeler was waiting for him outside. Jean drove off down
the drive with characteristic contempt for the laws of gravity when
Dan had piled in, and Carl Golden was there, looking thinner, more
gaunt and hawk-like than ever before, his brown eyes sharp under his
shock of black hair, his long, thin aquiline nose (""If you weren't a
Jew you'd be a discredit to the Gentiles,"" Dan Fowler had twitted him
once, years before, and Carl had looked down his long, thin, aquiline
nose, and sniffed, and let the matter drop, because until then he had
never been sure whether his being a Jew had mattered to Dan Fowler or
not, and now he knew, and was quite satisfied with the knowledge) and
the ever-present cigarette between thin, sensitive fingers. Dan
clapped him on the shoulder, and shot a black look at his daughter,
relegating her to an indescribable Fowler limbo, which was where she
belonged, and would reside until Dan got excited and forgot how she'd
betrayed him to Dr. Moss, which would take about ten or fifteen
minutes all told.",31236,1900s
"Kitty could
          No moment steal, do what she would,
          To see her Richard. Sorely vexed
          She was, and he still more perplexed. In spite of all he might devise
          A squeeze, a kiss, quick talk of eyes
          Was all he could obtain, no more. Bread butterless, a sanded floor,
          It seemed no better. Joy like this
          Could not suffice, more sterling bliss
          Our lovers wished, nor would stop short
          Till they'd obtained the thing they sought.",5300,1600s
"By means of this contrivance, I shall endeavour
to entertain you with with matters of the greatest moment. It is
true, that I shall speak of nothing but what I have already
mentioned; but it was not at the age of ninety-one, to which I have
now attained; a thing I cannot help taking notice of, because as I
advance in years, the sounder and heartier I grow, to the amazement
of all the world. I, who can account for it, am bound to shew, that
a many may enjoy a terrestrial paradise after eighty; which I enjoy;
but it is not to be obtained except by temperance and sobriety,
virtues so acceptable to the Almighty, because they are enemies to
sensuality, and friends to reason. Now, my lord, to begin, I must tell you, that, within these few days
past, I have been visited by many of the learned doctors of this
university, as well physicians and philosophers, who were well
acquainted with my age, my life, and manners; knowing how stout,
hearty, and gay I was; and in what perfection all my faculties still
continued; likewise my memory, spirits, and understanding; and even
my voice and teeth. They knew, besides, that I constantly employed
eight hours every day in writing treatises, with my own hand, on
subjects useful to mankind, and spent many hours in walking and
singing.",30660,1400s

larceny? And why not exclude from the suffrage all habitual drunkards
judicially so declared? These are changes which would do vastly more of
good than admitting women to vote. {END FOOTNOTE}

"There must surely be something wonderful about
her since she had completely fascinated two such tough old veterans and
brought them to a deadly feud. Morandot, having met Laguitte, did not
disguise his concern. If he—the major—was not killed, what would he
live upon? He had no fortune, and the pension to which his cross of the
Legion of Honor entitled him, with the half of a full regimental
pension which he would obtain on resigning, would barely find him in
bread. While Morandot was thus speaking Laguitte simply stared before
him with his round eyes, persevering in the dumb obstinacy born of his
narrow mind; and when his companion tried to question him regarding his
hatred for Burle, he simply made the same vague gesture as before and
once again repeated:

“He annoyed me; so much the worse.”

Every morning at mess and at the canteen the first words were: “Has the
acceptance of the major’s resignation arrived?” The duel was
impatiently expected and ardently discussed.",1069,1800s
"The shared-ness of our experience is only present
at a coarse level of measurement: once you get into really
granular observation, there are as many differences in our
""shared"" experience as there are similarities. More than that, though, is the way that a large collection of
electronic text differs from a small one: it's the difference
between a single book, a shelf full of books and a library of
books. Scale makes things different. Take the Web: none of us can
hope to read even a fraction of all the pages on the Web, but by
analyzing the link structures that bind all those pages together,
Google is able to actually tease out machine-generated
conclusions about the relative relevance of different pages to
different queries. None of us will ever eat the whole corpus, but
Google can digest it for us and excrete the steaming nuggets of
goodness that make it the search-engine miracle it is today.",11077,1900s

"Love, in Mark and Luke, when
they counted him among the apostles, did cover with silence this his
publican state (and it is meet for Peter to call Paul his beloved
brother, when Paul himself shall call himself the chief of sinners); but
faithfulness to the world, and a desire to be abased, that Christ
thereby, and grace by him, might be advanced, made Matthew, in his
evangelical writings, call himself by the name of Matthew the publican. Nor has he lost thereby; for Christ again to exalt him (as he hath also
done by the apostle Paul), hath set, by his special providence, the
testimony that this Matthew hath given of his birth, life, death,
doctrine, and miracles, in the front of all the New Testament. (2.) The next publican that I find by the Testament of Christ, made
mention of by name, is Levi, another of the apostles of Jesus Christ. This Levi also, by the Holy Ghost in holy writ, is called by the name of
James: not James the brother of John, for Zebedee was his father; but
James the son of Alpheus.",3548,1600s

"And truly enough, the old man, pressing the hand of Cinq-Mars, said
slowly and with difficulty, having placed himself near him:

""Yes, my son, and you, my children, I see with joy that my old friend
Bassompierre is about to be delivered by you, and that you are about to
avenge the Comte de Soissons and the young Montmorency. But it is
expedient for youth, all ardent as it is, to listen to those who have

"McClung, in his valuable Sketches of Western Adventure, in describing
this sanguinary battle, speaks of the Indians fighting from behind a
breastwork; Stone, in his Life of Brant, says the Indians were forced
to avail themselves of a rude breastwork of logs and brushwood, which
they had taken the precaution to construct for the occasion. There must
be some mistake in regard to this breastwork, as it is evident from the
circumstances of the case, that the Indians could not, before the
battle, have erected one so near the camp without discovery; and after
the action commenced, it was too fiercely prosecuted for a rampart of
this kind to have been thrown up. In regard to the number killed on either side, there is no very certain
information. Doddridge, in his Notes on the Indian wars, places the
number of whites killed in this action at seventy-five, and the wounded
at one hundred and forty. Campbell, in his History of Virginia, says
the number of whites who were killed was upwards of fifty, and that
ninety were wounded, which is probably near the truth.",15581,1700s
"About one o'clock on the morning of the 23d February, the Aurora
appeared over the hills in a south direction, presenting a brilliant
mass of light. The rolling motion of the light laterally was very
striking, as well as the increase of its intensity thus occasioned. The
light occupied horizontally about a point of the compass, and extended
in height scarcely a degree above the land, which seemed, however, to
conceal from us a part of the phenomenon. It was always evident enough
that the most attenuated light of the Aurora sensibly dimmed the stars,
like a thin veil drawn over them. We frequently listened for any sound
proceeding from this phenomenon, but never heard any.",14350,1700s

decretal Epistle to _Hesychius_ Bishop of _Salona_, directed him to
denounce the Apostolic decrees as well to the Bishops of his own, as to
those of the neighbouring Provinces. The subjection of these Provinces to
the See of _Rome_ seems to have begun in _Anemius_, who was ordained Bishop
of _Sirmium_ by _Ambrose_ Bishop of _Millain_, and who in the Council of

lower station densities than the poorest night at Tampico, but since
they cover only a three-hour watch, they reveal little or nothing
concerning the breadth of the so-called coastal flyway. April flight densities at Tampico are the highest recorded in the
course of this study. The maximum hourly density of 21,200 birds is 46

contented, and the next day the King went on hunting with two of our men,
and the other a fishing and abroad as before, till our Shallop returned
from James towne with the two Salvages, sent home with Captaine Croshaw:

"But the glory, that growth not ouer fast,
  Is euer great, and likeliest long to last._

Againe in a ditty to a mistresse of ours, where we likened the cure of
Loue to _Achilles_ launce. _The launce so bright, that made Telephus wound,
  The same rusty, salued the sore againe,
  So may my meede (Madame) of you redownd,
  Whose rigour was first suthour of my paine._

The _Tuskan_ poet vseth this _Resemblance_, inuring as well by
_Dissimilitude_ as _Similitude_, likening himselfe (by _Implication_) to
the flie, and neither to the eagle nor to the owle: very well Englished by
Sir Thomas Wiat after his fashion and by myselfe thus:
  _There be some fowles of sight so prowd and starke,
  As can behold the sunne, and neuer shrinke,
  Some so feeble, as they are faine to winke,
  Or neuer come abroad till it be darke:
  Others there be so simple, as they thinke,
  Because it shines, so sport them in the fire,
  And feele vnware, the wrong of the desire,
  Fluttring amidst the flame that doth them burne,
  Of this last ranke (alas) am I aright,
  For in my ladies lookes to stand or turne
  I haue no power, ne find place to retire,
  Where any darke may shade me from her sight
  But to her beames so bright whilst I aspire,
  I perish by the bane of my delight._

Againe in these likening a wise man to the true louer. _As true loue is constant with his enioy,
  And asketh no witnesse nor no record,
  And as faint loue is euermore most coy,
  To boast and brag his troth at euery word:
  Euen so the wise without enother meede:
  Contents him with the guilt of his good deede._

And in this resembling the learning of an euill man to the seedes sowen in
barren ground. _As the good seedes sowen in fruitfull soyle,
  Bring foorth foyson when barren doeth them spoile:
  So doeth it fare when much good learning hits,
  Vpon shrewde willes and ill disposed wits._

And in these likening the wise man to an idiot. _A sage man said, many of those that come
  To Athens schoole for wisdome, ere they went
  They first seem'd wise, then louers of wisdome,
  Then Orators, then idiots, which is meant
  That in wisedome all such as profite most,
  Are least surlie, and little apt to boast._

Againe, for a louer, whose credit vpon some report had bene shaken, he
prayeth better opinion by similitude.",16420,1500s

"And yet we find that all the countries through which
the above-named rivers pass, either have been, or promise to be,
the seats of much more wealthy and powerful nations than the
countries through which those rivers pass whose course is east or
west. The cause of this superiority of one over the other, is to
be traced to the greater diversity of productions, which will
necessarily be raised on the banks and in the vicinity of those
rivers whose course is north or south, a circumstance that is
alone sufficient to ensure the possessors of them, under
Governments equally favourable to the extension of industry, a
much greater share of commerce and wealth than can possibly
belong to the inhabitants of these rivers whose course is in a
contrary direction: and this for the simplest reason; because
rivers of the former description contain within themselves, many
of those productions which the latter can only obtain from
abroad. In the one, therefore, there is not only a necessity for
having recourse to foreign supply, which does not exist in the
other, but also a great prevention to internal navigation,
arising from the sameness of produce, and the consequent
impediment to barter, which must prevail in a country where all
have the same commodities to dispose of, where all wish to sell
and none to buy. To this manifest superiority which rivers
runningon a meridian claim over those running on a parallel,
there is no counterpoise, since they both contain equal
facilities for exporting their surplus productions, and receiving
in exchange the superfluities of other countries. It may, indeed,
here be urged, that there is, upon the whole, no surplus produce
in the world; and that, as the surplus, whatever may be its
extent, of one country, may be always exchanged for that of
another, as great a variety of luxuries may be thus obtained by
the inhabitants of rivers that run in an eastern or western
direction as can possibly be raised by the inhabitants of rivers
that run in a northern or southern; and that consequently the
same stimulus to an inland navigation will be created by the
eventual distribution of the various commodities procured by
foreign commerce, as if they had been the products of the country
itself.",15602,1700s

While the beasts of prey,
Come from caverns deep,
Viewed the maid asleep. The kingly lion stood,
And the virgin viewed:
Then he gambolled round
O’er the hallowed ground. Leopards, tigers, play
Round her as she lay;

Bowed his mane of gold,

side, if there should be too much ease given in this kind, it would
occasion sloth, and so destroy industry, the principal nerve of a
commonwealth. But if aught might be done to hold the balance even
between these two, it would be a work in this nation equal to that for
which Fabius was surnamed Maximus by the Romans. “In manufactures and merchandise the Hollander has gotten the start of
us; but at the long run it will be found that a people working upon a
foreign commodity does but farm the manufacture, and that it is really
entailed upon them only where the growth of it is native; as also that
it is one thing to have the carriage of other men’s goods, and another
for a man to bring his own to the best market. Wherefore (nature having

lawful and natural causes, as _Paracelsus_ strongly holds (the glass
being but made as that which he saw in _Spain_, of the _Electrum_ that

punctual instance to prove that words are operative, which is the thing

"Accompanied by the Duc de Gramont, he directed
himself towards the scene of the disturbance, although advised not to do
so. When he arrived at the top of the Rue Saint Denis, the crowd and the
tumult made him judge that it would be best to alight from his coach. He
advanced, therefore, on foot with the Duc de Grammont among the furious
and infinite crowd of people, of whom he asked the cause of this uproar,
promised them bread, spoke his best with gentleness but firmness, and
remonstrated with them. He was listened to. Cries, several times

"Here Captain Wharton interfered; and, by explaining the mistake of
Colonel Wellmere to proceed from his irritated mind and pain of body,
he in part succeeded in mollifying the insulted practitioner, who
consented to look further into the hurts of the other. They were
chiefly bruises from his fall, to which Sitgreaves made some hasty
applications, and withdrew. The horse, having taken their required refreshment, prepared to fall
back to their intended position, and it became incumbent on Dunwoodie
to arrange the disposal of his prisoners. Sitgreaves he determined to
leave in the cottage of Mr. Wharton, in attendance on Captain

"A large amount of inheritable and
diversified variability is favourable, but I believe mere individual
differences suffice for the work. A large number of individuals, by
giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of
profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of
variability in each individual, and is, I believe, an extremely
important element of success. Though nature grants vast periods of time
for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite
period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to
seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does
not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its
competitors, it will soon be exterminated. In man’s methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite
object, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. But when many
men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common
standard of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best
animals, much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow
from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large
amount of crossing with inferior animals.",1228,1800s

"He noted that in the beginning of his novitiate he spent the hours
appointed for private prayer in thinking of God so as to convince his
mind and impress deeply upon his heart the Divine existence. He did this
by devout sentiments and submission to the lights of faith, rather than
by studied reasonings and elaborate meditations. By this short and sure
method he exercised himself in the knowledge and love of God, resolving
to use his utmost endeavor to live in a continual sense of His Presence,
and, if possible, never to forget Him more. When he had thus, in prayer, filled his mind with great sentiments of that
Infinite Being, he went to his work appointed in the kitchen (for he was
then cook for the community). There having first considered severally the
things his office required, and when and how each thing was to be done,
he spent all the intervals of his time, both before and after his work,
in prayer.",5657,1600s

Gratitude due to her whose utmost Services he exacts as strict Duty? Because she was made to be a Slave to his Will, and has no higher End
than to Serve and Obey him? Perhaps we arrogate too much to our selves,
when we say this Material World was made for our Sakes: That its
Glorious Maker has given us the Use of it is certain; but when we
suppose any Thing to be made purely for our Sakes, because we have
Dominion over it, we draw a false Conclusion. As he who should say the
People were made for the Prince who is set over them, would be thought
to be out of his Senses as well as his Politicks.",61143,1600s
"A tremendous sand desert, marked with low, washed-down
mountains, and the vague, angular, geometric mounds of human cities that
were gone forever. Beyond the eastern rim of the continent, the plain dipped downward
steeply. The white of dried salt was on the hills, but there was a
little green growth here, too. The dead sea-bottom of the vanished
Atlantic was not as dead as the highlands. Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah, the city of the rodents, came into

we'll be able to do something for him; and if he ain't quite respectable
our Boy'll find it out quick enough. He's got a pleasant sort o' way
with him that makes everybody tell him everything.”

Next day, after he'd had his tea, the Boy strolled up the chalky track
that led to the summit of the Downs; and there, sure enough, he found
the dragon, stretched lazily on the sward in front of his cave. The view
from that point was a magnificent one. To the right and left, the bare
and billowy leagues of Downs; in front, the vale, with its clustered
homesteads, its threads of white roads running through orchards and
well-tilled acreage, and, far away, a hint of grey old cities on the
horizon.",270,1800s

_examine_, _range_, and _dispose_ of the bank which is laid up in the
Memory: but it must be sure to make _distinction_ between the _sober_ and
_well collected heap_, and the _extravagant Ideas_, and _mistaken Images_,
which there it may sometimes light upon. So many are the _links_, upon
which the true Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be _loose_, or
_weak_, the whole _chain_ is in danger of being dissolv’d; it is to _begin_
with the Hands and Eyes, and to _proceed_ on through the Memory, to be
_continued_ by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to _come about_ to
the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a _continual passage round_ from one
Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as
the body of man is by the _circulation_ of the blood through the several
parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head. If once this method were followed with diligence and attention, there is
nothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far more
effectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass; we might not only
hope for Inventions to equalize those of _Copernicus_, _Galileo_,
_Gilbert_, _Harvy_, and of others, whose Names are almost lost, that were
the Inventors of _Gun-powder_, the _Seamans Compass_, _Printing_,
_Etching_, _Graving_, _Microscopes_, &c. but multitudes that may far exceed
them: for even those discoveries seem to have been the products of some
such method, though but imperfect; What may not be therefore expected from
it if thoroughly prosecuted? _Talking_ and _contention of Arguments_ would
soon be turn’d into _labours_; all the fine _dreams_ of Opinions, and
_universal metaphysical natures_, which the luxury of subtil Brains has
devis’d, would quickly vanish, and give place to _solid Histories_,
_Experiments_ and _Works._ And as at first, mankind _fell_ by _tasting_ of
the forbidden Tree of Knowledge, so we, their Posterity, may be in part
_restor’d_ by the same way, not only by _beholding_ and _contemplating_,
but by _tasting_ too those fruits of Natural knowledge, that were never yet
forbidden. From hence the World may be assisted with _variety_ of Inventions, _new_
matter for Sciences may be _collected_, the _old improv’d_, and their
_rust_ rubb’d away; and as it is by the benefit of Senses that we receive
all our Skill in the works of Nature, so they also may be wonderfully
benefited by it, and may be guided to an easier and more exact performance
of their Offices; ’tis not unlikely, but that we may find out wherein our
Senses are deficient, and as easily find wayes of repairing them.",15491,1600s

sooner heard, but quitted their Childish Weapons; and this was no
sooner done but this Sanguinary _Spaniard_ sent some to possess
themselves of the Fortifications, and they being secur'd, to attaque
the _Indians_. Thus they, like Wolves and Lyons, did rush upon this
flock of Sheep, and were so tired with slaughter, that they were forced
to desist for a while and take breath, which done, the Captain commands
them to fall to it again at the same bloody rate, and precipitate all
that survived the Butchery, from the top of the Mountain, which was of
a prodigious height; and that was perform'd accordingly. And the
Witnesses farther declare upon Oath, that they saw the  bodies of about
seven hundred _Indians_ falling from the Mount at one time, like a
Cloud obscuring the Air, who were all broken to pieces. This very Tyrant came once to the city _Cota_, where he surprized
abundance of Men, together with fifteen or twenty Casics of the highest
rank and quality, whom he cast to the Dogs to be torn Limb-meal in
pieces, and cut off the Hands of several Men and Women, which being run
through with a pole, were exposed to be viewed and gaz'd upon by the

of Burgundy, as a male fief of the kingdom; he also took possession of
Franche Comte at the same time; the King's armies recovered all Picardy,
and even entered Flanders. Then Mary of Burgundy, hoping to raise up a
barrier against this dangerous neighbour, offered her hand, with all her
great territories, to young Maximilian of Austria, and married him within
six months after her father's death. To this wedding is due the rise to
real greatness of the House of Austria; it begins the era of the larger
politics of modern times. After a little hesitation Louis determined to continue the struggle
against the Burgundian power. He secured Franche Comte, and on his

"Whatever the
resolution these princes should adopt, Richelieu would equally attain
his object. By their separation from the Austrian interest, Ferdinand
would be exposed to the combined attack of France and Sweden; and
Gustavus Adolphus, freed from his other enemies in Germany, would be
able to direct his undivided force against the hereditary dominions of
Austria. In that event, the fall of Austria was inevitable, and this
great object of Richelieu's policy would be gained without injury to the
church. If, on the other hand, the princes of the League persisted in
their opposition, and adhered to the Austrian alliance, the result would
indeed be more doubtful, but still France would have sufficiently proved
to all Europe the sincerity of her attachment to the Catholic cause, and
performed her duty as a member of the Roman Church. The princes of the
League would then appear the sole authors of those evils, which the
continuance of the war would unavoidably bring upon the Roman Catholics
of Germany; they alone, by their wilful and obstinate adherence to the
Emperor, would frustrate the measures employed for their protection,
involve the church in danger, and themselves in ruin.",6772,1700s

"The more we reflect on this
state, the more convinced we shall be, that it was the least subject
of any to revolutions, the best for man, and that nothing could have
drawn him out of it but some fatal accident, which, for the public
good, should never have happened. The example of the savages, most of
whom have been found in this condition, seems to confirm that mankind
was formed ever to remain in it, that this condition is the real youth
of the world, and that all ulterior improvements have been so many
steps, in appearance towards the perfection of individuals, but in
fact towards the decrepitness of the species. As long as men remained satisfied with their rustic cabins; as long as
they confined themselves to the use of clothes made of the skins of
other animals, and the use of thorns and fish-bones, in putting these
skins together; as long as they continued to consider feathers and
shells as sufficient ornaments, and to paint their bodies of different
colours, to improve or ornament their bows and arrows, to form and
scoop out with sharp-edged stones some little fishing boats, or clumsy
instruments of music; in a word, as long as they undertook such works
only as a single person could finish, and stuck to such arts as did
not require the joint endeavours of several hands, they lived free,
healthy, honest and happy, as much as their nature would admit, and
continued to enjoy with each other all the pleasures of an independent
intercourse; but from the moment one man began to stand in need of
another's assistance; from the moment it appeared an advantage for one
man to possess the quantity of provisions requisite for two, all
equality vanished; property started up; labour became necessary; and
boundless forests became smiling fields, which it was found necessary
to water with human sweat, and in which slavery and misery were soon
seen to sprout out and grow with the fruits of the earth. Metallurgy and agriculture were the two arts whose invention produced
this great revolution. With the poet, it is gold and silver, but with
the philosopher it is iron and corn, which have civilized men, and
ruined mankind.",11136,1700s
"An extensive inflammation of the erysipelatous kind, appeared without
any apparent cause upon the upper part of the thigh of a sucking
colt, the property of Mr. Millet, a farmer at Rockhampton, a village
near Berkeley. The inflammation continued several weeks, and at
length terminated in the formation of three or four small abscesses. The inflamed parts were fomented, and dressings were applied by some
of the same persons who were employed in milking the cows. The number
of cows milked was twenty-four, and the whole of them had the
Cow-pox. The milkers, consisting of the farmer's wife, a man and a
maid servant, were infected by the cows.",29414,1700s
"The Society has, for years, been managed by a PARTY, or COTERIE, or
by whatever other name may be most fit to designate a combination of
persons, united by no expressed compact or written regulations, but who
act together from a community of principles. That each individual has
invariably supported all the measures of the party, is by no means the
case; and whilst instances of opposition amongst them have been very
rare, a silent resignation to circumstances has been the most usual mode
of meeting measures they disapproved. The great object of this, as of
all other parties, has been to maintain itself in power, and to divide,
as far as it could, all the good things amongst its members. It has
usually consisted of persons of very moderate talent, who have had
the prudence, whenever they could, to associate with themselves other
members of greater ability, provided these latter would not oppose the
system, and would thus lend to it the sanction of their name. The party
have always praised each other most highly--have invariably opposed all
improvements in the Society, all change in the mode of management;
and have maintained, that all those who wished for any alteration were
factious; and, when they discovered any symptoms of independence and
inquiry breaking out in any member of the Council, they have displaced
him as soon as they decently could.",1216,1700s

London lady stare, if some half-dozen--though perhaps among the most
chosen favourites of her visiting-list--were to walk unbidden into her
presence, in bonnets and shawls, between the hours of eight and eleven! And how strangely new would it seem, were the pleasantest and most
coveted engagements of the week, formed without ceremony and kept
without ostentation, to arise from a casual meeting at the beginning
of it! It is this ease, this habitual absence of ceremony and parade, this
national enmity to constraint and tediousness of all kinds, which
renders the tone of French manners so infinitely more agreeable than
our own. And the degree in which this is the case can only be guessed
at by those who, by some happy accident or other, possess a real and
effective ""open sesame!""",38997,1700s

"The judgment is, perhaps, too clouded to fix upon a right purpose:
the will too enfeebled to pursue it. Two general remarks may be applied to all, interferences of
the physical with the moral sanity; 1st, That it is not so much
by absolute deductions of time that ill health operates upon the
serviceableness of a man, as by its lingering effects upon his
temper and his animal spirits. Many a man has not lost one hour
of his life from illness, whose faculties of usefulness have been
most seriously impaired through gloom, or untuned feelings; 3d,
That it is not the direct and known risks to our health which act
with the most fatal effects, but the semi-conscious condition, the
atmosphere of circumstances, with which artificial life surrounds
us. The great cities of Europe, perhaps London beyond all others,
under the modern modes of life and business, create a vortex of
preternatural tumult, a rush and frenzy of excitement, which is fatal
to far more than are heard of as express victims to that system. The late Lord Londonderry's nervous seizure was no solitary or rare
case.",6123,1700s

Otaheite, in person, dress, language, and every other circumstance,
except, if Tupia might be believed, that they would not steal. Soon after dinner, we came to an anchor, in a small but excellent
harbour on the west side of the island, which the natives call
_Owharre_, in eighteen fathom water, clear ground, and secure from all

"He then fortified the city and port, and having assembled
a large body of cavalry, pillaged the surrounding country. The king,
learning this, and aware of the redoubtable character of his assailant,
immediately sent messengers to all the surrounding powers, to request
assistance against the common enemy, and ordered the immediate return of
the duke of Calabria with the forces at Sienna. This attack, however it might annoy the duke and the rest of Italy,
occasioned the utmost joy at Florence and Sienna; the latter thinking it
had recovered its liberty, and the former that she had escaped a storm
which threatened her with destruction. These impressions, which were not
unknown to the duke, increased the regret he felt at his departure
from Sienna; and he accused fortune of having, by an unexpected and
unaccountable accident, deprived him of the sovereignty of Tuscany. The
same circumstance changed the disposition of the pope; for although he
had previously refused to receive any ambassador from Florence, he was
now so mollified as to be anxious to listen to any overtures of peace;
and it was intimated to the Florentines, that if they would condescend
to ask the pope's pardon, they would be sure of obtaining it.",2464,1400s

am now myself on the brink of the same precipice; I have spent some time

judges, who would give the cause for a poor man right or wrong; for
though that be an error on the better hand, yet it is still a partiality,
and a rich man unheard cannot be concluded an oppressor. I remember a
saying of King Charles II. on Sir Matthew Hale (who was doubtless an
uncorrupt and upright man), that his servants were sure to be cast on any
trial which was heard before him; not that he thought the judge was
possibly to be bribed, but that his integrity might be too scrupulous,
and that the causes of the Crown were always suspicious when the
privileges of subjects were concerned. It had been much fairer if the modern critics who have embarked in the
quarrels of their favourite authors had rather given to each his proper
due without taking from another’s heap to raise their own.",2615,1600s

"The other was a tournament (for so they call the exhibition
of equestrian combats), in which the sons of the first families in the
city took part with the most celebrated cavaliers of Italy. Among the
most distinguished of the Florentine youth was Lorenzo, eldest son of
Piero, who, not by favor, but by his own personal valor, obtained the
principal prize. When these festivals were over, the citizens reverted
to the same thoughts which had previously occupied them, and each
pursued his ideas with more earnestness than ever. Serious differences
and troubles were the result; and these were greatly increased by two
circumstances: one of which was, that the authority of the balia had
expired; the other, that upon the death of Duke Francesco, Galeazzo the
new duke sent ambassadors to Florence, to renew the engagements of his
father with the city, which, among other things, provided that every
year a certain sum of money should be paid to the duke. The principal
opponents of the Medici took occasion, from this demand, to make public
resistance in the councils, on pretense that the alliance was made with
Francesco and not Galeazzo; so that Francesco being dead, the obligation
had ceased; nor was there any necessity to revive it, because Galeazzo
did not possess his father's talents, and consequently they neither
could nor ought to expect the same benefits from him; that if they had
derived little advantage from Francesco, they would obtain still less
from Galeazzo; and that if any citizen wished to hire him for his own
purposes, it was contrary to civil rule, and inconsistent with the
public liberty.",2464,1400s

made in this letter, and to persuade yourself that I have never thought
any evil concerning your person; further, that I am one who desires that
eternal blessing may fall to your lot, and that I have no dispute with
any man concerning morals, but only concerning the word of truth. In all
other things I will yield to any one, but I neither can nor will forsake
and deny the word. He who thinks otherwise of me, or has taken in my

truth. Your see, however, which is called the Court of Rome, and which neither
you nor any man can deny to be more corrupt than any Babylon or Sodom,

this I have verily abominated, and have felt indignant that the people
of Christ should be cheated under your name and the pretext of the
Church of Rome; and so I have resisted, and will resist, as long as
the spirit of faith shall live in me. Not that I am striving after
impossibilities, or hoping that by my labours alone, against the furious
opposition of so many flatterers, any good can be done in that most
disordered Babylon; but that I feel myself a debtor to my brethren, and
am bound to take thought for them, that fewer of them may be ruined, or
that their ruin may be less complete, by the plagues of Rome.",1911,1400s

quite near us, with us--the ones who seem to have gone away and whom we
feel we cannot live without. If once we could be sure! There would be no

 taking up his temporary abode with his guardian, Joseph Kinghorn, a
 Baptist minister of note and a prominent member of a literary
 circle then existing in Norwich, by whom his education was
 superintended. On arriving at man's estate and being at that time
 possessed of ample means, he devoted himself to the study of

opinion of meriting grace, are contrary to the Gospel, it follows that
it is not lawful for any bishop to institute or exact such services. For
it is necessary that the doctrine of Christian liberty be preserved in
the churches, namely, that the bondage of the Law is not necessary to
justification, as it is written in the Epistle to the Galatians, 5, 1:
Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. It is necessary that
the chief article of the Gospel be preserved, to wit, that we obtain
grace freely by faith in Christ, and not for certain observances or acts
of worship devised by men. What, then, are we to think of the Sunday and like rites in the house of

the laws of nature to do every thing, from which it may reap any
benefit, so I most ardently wish perpetual duration, and a long
succession of every kind of prosperity. Such are my genuine and
no trifling satisfactions; such are the recreations and diversions
of my old age, which is so much the more to be valued than the old
age, or even youth, of other men, because being freed, by God's
grace, from the perturbations of the mind, and the infirmities of
the body, it no longer experiences any of those contrary emotions,
which torment a number of young men, and many old ones destitute of
strength and health, and every other blessing. And if it be lawful to compare little matters, and such as are
esteemed trifling, to affairs of importance, I will further
venture to say, that such are the effects of this sober life,
that at my present age of eighty-three, I have been able to write
a very entertaining comedy, abounding with innocent mirth and
pleasant jests. This species of composition is generally the child
and offspring of youth, as tragedy is that of old age; the former
being by its facetious and sprightly turn suited to the bloom of
life, and the latter by its gravity adapted to riper years. Now,
if that good old man [Sophocles], a Grecian by birth, and a poet,
was so much extolled for having written a tragedy at the age of
seventy-three, and, on that account alone, reputed of sound memory
and understanding, though tragedy be a grave and melancholy poem;
why should I be deemed less happy, and to have a smaller share of
memory and understanding, who have, at an age, ten years more
advanced than his, written a comedy, which, as every one knows,
is a merry and pleasant kind of composition?",30660,1400s

bitter temper of Montespan; and, affecting great devotion, she told the
King that his affliction was sent him by Heaven, as a punishment for the
sins he had committed with Montespan. She was eloquent, and had very

"Hence there was very great need to treat
of, and renew, this doctrine of faith in Christ, to the end that anxious
consciences should not be without consolation but that they might know
that grace and forgiveness of sins and justification are apprehended by
faith in Christ. Men are also admonished that here the term ""faith"" does not signify
merely the knowledge of the history, such as is in the ungodly and in
the devil, but signifies a faith which believes, not merely the
history, but also the effect of the history--namely, this Article: the
forgiveness of sins, to wit, that we have grace, righteousness, and
forgiveness of sins through Christ. Now he that knows that he has a Father gracious to him through Christ,
truly knows God; he knows also that God cares for him, and calls upon
God; in a word, he is not without God, as the heathen. For devils and

"Whatever money the
schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter’s pay but a
day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his
disappearance. The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the
following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the
churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin
had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of
others were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them
all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook
their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried
off by the Galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in nobody’s
debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him; the school was
removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue
reigned in his stead.",41,1700s
"Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what
presumed, and no further? Lastly, who shall forbid and separate all idle
resort, all evil company? These things will be, and must be; but how
they shall be least hurtful, how least enticing, herein consists the
grave and governing wisdom of a state. To sequester out of the world into Atlantic and Utopian polities, which
never can be drawn into use, will not mend our condition; but to ordain
wisely as in this world of evil, in the midst whereof God hath placed
us unavoidably. Nor is it Plato's licensing of books will do this, which
necessarily pulls along with it so many other kinds of licensing, as
will make us all both ridiculous and weary, and yet frustrate; but
those unwritten, or at least unconstraining, laws of virtuous education,
religious and civil nurture, which Plato there mentions as the bonds and
ligaments of the commonwealth, the pillars and the sustainers of every
written statute; these they be which will bear chief sway in such
matters as these, when all licensing will be easily eluded.",608,1600s
"“Farewell, my brother, great chief of the Wyandots,” he said. “You have
come far with your warriors, and you have been by our side in battle. The Six Nations owe you much. You have helped us in victory, and you
have not deserted us in defeat. You are the greatest of warriors, the
boldest in battle, and the most skillful.”

Timmendiquas made a deprecatory gesture, but Thayendanegea went on:

“I speak but the truth, great chief of the Wyandots.",1078,1800s
"And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart. But the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to
beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter and fainter grew her song,
and she felt something choking her in her throat. Then she gave one last burst of music.",902,1800s
"From the first word I had read my dismissal in every uneasy glance of
his little eyes. “I am afraid,” said I, “that that is rather further than I am prepared
to go. I think that since there has been for some weeks a certain
friction between Lady Saltire and myself, it would perhaps be as well
that I should resign the post which I hold in your household. I shall
be happy, however, to remain here until you have found some one to take
over my duties.”

“Well, I am sorry it has come to this, and yet it may be that you are
right,” said he, with an expression of relief; “as to James, there need
be no difficulty about that, for Dr. Patterson could come in tomorrow
morning.”

“Then to-morrow morning let it be,” I answered. “Very good, Dr. Munro; I will see that you have your cheque before you
go.”

So there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices
and wonderful introductions!",290,1800s

"Therefore, to be possess'd with double pompe,
To guard a Title, that was rich before;
To gilde refined Gold, to paint the Lilly;
To throw a perfume on the Violet,
To smooth the yce, or adde another hew
Vnto the Raine-bow; or with Taper-light
To seeke the beauteous eye of heauen to garnish,
Is wastefull, and ridiculous excesse

   Pem. But that your Royall pleasure must be done,
This acte, is as an ancient tale new told,
And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
Being vrged at a time vnseasonable

   Sal. In this the Anticke, and well noted face
Of plaine old forme, is much disfigured,
And like a shifted winde vnto a saile,
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
Startles, and frights consideration:
Makes sound opinion sicke, and truth suspected,
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe

   Pem. When Workemen striue to do better then wel,
They do confound their skill in couetousnesse,
And oftentimes excusing of a fault,
Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse:
As patches set vpon a little breach,
Discredite more in hiding of the fault,
Then did the fault before it was so patch'd

   Sal. To this effect, before you were new crown'd
We breath'd our Councell: but it pleas'd your Highnes
To ouer-beare it, and we are all well pleas'd,
Since all, and euery part of what we would
Doth make a stand, at what your Highnesse will

"And Plants are no less subject to be destroy'd by Insects, than Men and
Quadrupedes, is I have explain'd in the Chapter of Blights, in my _New
Improvements of Planting and Gardening_. _Plants_ of all degrees are subject to Blights, which are so variously
communicated to them, that sometimes a whole Tree will perish by that
Distemper; now and then a few Leaves, or Blossoms only, and perhaps a
Branch or two, will be shrivel'd, or scorch'd by it, and the rest remain
green and flourishing. I have yet never observ'd this Disease to happen
among Plants, but upon the blowing of sharp and clear _Easterly_ Winds,
which are most frequent in _England_ about _March_; but sometimes happen
in other Months. It is very observable, that the _Caterpillars_ generally
attend these Winds, chiefly infecting some one sort of Tree more than
another, and even then not every where upon the kind of Tree they attack,
but some particular Branches only; from which Observations I think we may
draw the following Inferences, either that the Eggs of those Insects are
brought to us by the _Easterly_ Winds, or that the Temperature of the Air,
when the _Easterly_ Winds blow, is necessary to hatch those Creatures,
supposing their Eggs were already laid upon those infected Parts of the
Trees the preceding Year. The Blights which are attended with large _Worms_ or _Caterpillars_, seem
to be rather hatch'd with the _East_ Wind, than that the Eggs of those
Creatures are brought along with it; but those Blights which produce only
those small Insects which occasion the curling of the Leaves of Trees, may
proceed from Swarms of them, either hatch'd or in the Egg, which are
brought with the Wind.",31807,1600s
"There was word of a fight to the north,
  And a column hard-pressed,
  So they started the Highlanders forth,
  Without food, without rest. But the pipers gaily played,
  Chanting their fierce delight,
  And the armoured carriages rocked and swayed,
  Laden with men of the Scotch Brigade,
  Hurrying up to the fight,
  And the grim, grey Highland engineer,
  Driving them into the night. Then a signal light glowed red,
  And a picket came to the track. 'Enemy holding the line ahead,
  Three of our mates we have left for dead,
  Only we two got back.' And far to the north through the still night air,
  They heard the rifles crack.",304,1800s

was ready to yield myself up with solemnity to the mystic grandeur of
the scene of initiation. Pompey’s Pillar must stand like a mountain, in
a yellow plain, surrounded by a grove of obelisks as tall as
palm-trees. Placid sphinxes brooding o’er the Nile—mighty Memnonian
countenances calm—had revealed Egypt to me in a sonnet of Tennyson’s,
and I was ready to gaze on it with pyramidal wonder and hieroglyphic
awe. The landing quay at Alexandria is like the dockyard quay at Portsmouth:
with a few score of brown faces scattered among the population. There
are slop-sellers, dealers in marine-stores, bottled-porter shops,
seamen lolling about; flys and cabs are plying for hire; and a yelling
chorus of donkey-boys, shrieking, “Ride, sir!—Donkey, sir!—I say, sir!”

"NOW if we compare this last Remark of the _Intemperance of the Climate_
in _Æthiopia_, with what the _Arabian_ Physicians[47], who lived near
these Countries, declare, that _Pestilences_ are brought by
_unseasonable_ Moistures, Heats, and want of Winds; I believe we shall
be fully instructed in the usual Cause of this Disease. Which from all
these Observations compared together, I conclude to arise from the
_Putrefaction_ so constantly generated in these Countries, when _that_
is hightened and increased by the ill State of Air now described; and
especially from the _Putrefaction_ of animal Substances. IT is very plain, that animal Bodies are capable of being altered into a
Matter fit to breed this Disease: because this is the Case of every one
who is sick of it, the Humours in him being corrupted into a Substance
which will _infect_ others. And it is not improbable, that the volatile
Parts with which Animals abound, may in some ill States of Air in the
sultry Heats of _Africa_ be converted by Putrefaction into a Substance
of the same kind: since in these colder Regions, we sometimes find them
to contract a greater Degree of Acrimony than most other Substances will
do by _putrefying_, and also more dangerous for Men to come within the
reach of their Action; as in those pernicious, and even poysonous
Juices, which are sometimes generated in corrupted Carcasses: Of which I
have formerly given one very remarkable Instance[48], and, if it were
necessary, many more might be produced, especially in _hydropic Bodies_,
and in _cancerous Tumors_. Nay more, we find _animal Putrefaction_
sometimes to produce in these _Northern_ Climates very fatal Distempers,
though they do not arise to the Malignity of the true _Plague_: For such
_Fevers_ are often bred, where a large Number of People are closely
confined together; as in _Goals_, _Sieges_, and _Camps_.",32171,1600s
"The slaves have already
spoken! A faintness as of death falls upon her; but she is a
true daughter of false Egypt, and a wiser than Potiphar
would find in her face no shadow of the fear that lies heavy
on her heart. The game is called and she must play not for
name and fame, but for love and life. Her husband
confronts her, ferocity incarnate,--the great cord-like veins
of the broad, low brow and massive neck knotted and
black, his eyes blazing like the orbs of an angry lion seen
by the flickering light of a shepherd's fire. He essays to
speak, but his tongue is thick, his lips parched as one
stricken with the plague, and instead of words there comes
through his set teeth a hoarse, hissing sound as of the
great rock serpent in its wrath.",567,1800s
"He would wait. When he knew Mr. Jack better--perhaps
then he would tell; but not now. NOW Mr. Jack might think he was a

"Such sweet observance in this work was had,
    That one might see those far-off eyes look sad. In great commanders grace and majesty
You might behold, triumphing in their faces;
In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;
And here and there the painter interlaces
Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces,
    Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,
    That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble. In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art
Of physiognomy might one behold! The face of either ciphered either’s heart;
Their face their manners most expressly told. In Ajax’ eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled,
    But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent

And that insufficient colloquy was the beginning of a prolonged
estrangement between us. It was characteristic of our relations that we
never reopened the discussion. The thing had been in the air for some
time; we had recognised it now; the widening breach between us was
confessed. My own feelings were curiously divided. It is remarkable that
my very real affection for Margaret only became evident to me with this
quarrel.",1047,1800s
"The accident which you come back to incessantly, and
which distresses me also, is doubtless deplorable; but, after all, it is
not a murder, an ambush, a premeditated assassination. I imagine that if
such a catastrophe had happened elsewhere, and been reported to us in a
gazette or a book, you would have read of it with interest and
commiseration; but we should not have seen you clasp your hands over your
head, turn red and pale, utter loud cries, shed tears, sob, and scold a
coachman, postilions, perhaps even me. The event, would, nevertheless,
be actually the same. Admit, then, madame, and you, too, Madame
d'Hudicourt, that there is an exaggeration in your sorrow, and that you
would have made, both of you, two excellent comedians."" Madame de Maintenon, piqued at these last words, sought to make us
understand, and even make us admit, that there is a great difference
between an event narrated to you by a third party, and an event which one
has seen.",3851,1600s
"Why should I be thought to be against a fire in the
chimney, because I say it must not be in the thatch of the house? Consider, then, how pernicious a thing it is to make every doctrine
(though true) the bond of communion; this is that which destroys unity,
and by this rule all men must be perfect before they can be in peace: for
do we not see daily, that as soon as men come to a clearer understanding
of the mind of God (to say the best of what they hold), that presently
all men are excommunicable, if not damnable, that do not agree with them. Do not some believe and see that to be pride and covetousness, which
others do not, because (it may be) they have more narrowly and diligently
searched into their duty of these things than others have? What then? Must all men that have not so large acquaintance of their duty herein be
excommunicated?",3614,1600s
"He proffers the sword, at
which, he says, we possess some equality—I do not decline the weapon;
for company, two gentlemen—I shall endeavour to procure myself an
associate, and a suitable partner for you, sir, if you incline to join
in the dance.”

“I kiss your hand, sir, and rest yours, under a sense of obligation,”
answered the envoy. “I thank you, sir,” continued the King; “I will therefore be ready at
place and time, and suitably furnished; and I will either give your
friend such satisfaction with my sword as he requires, or will render
him such cause for not doing so as he will be contented with.”

“You will excuse me, sir,” said Wildrake, “if my mind is too dull,
under the circumstances, to conceive any alternative that can remain
betwixt two men of honour in such a case, excepting—sa—sa—.” He threw
himself into a fencing position, and made a pass with his sheathed
rapier, but not directed towards the person of the King, whom he
addressed. “Excuse me, sir,” said Charles, “if I do not trouble your intellects
with the consideration of a case which may not occur.—But, for example,
I may plead urgent employment on the part of the public.” This he spoke
in a low and mysterious tone of voice, which Wildrake appeared
perfectly to comprehend; for he laid his forefinger on his nose with
what he meant for a very intelligent and apprehensive nod. “Sir,” said he, “if you be engaged in any affair for the King, my
friend shall have every reasonable degree of patience—Nay, I will fight
him myself in your stead, merely to stay his stomach, rather than you
should be interrupted.—And, sir, if you can find room in your
enterprise for a poor gentleman that has followed Lunsford and Goring,
you have but to name day, time, and place of rendezvous; for truly,
sir, I am tired of the scald hat, cropped hair, and undertaker’s cloak,
with which my friend has bedizened me, and would willingly ruffle it
out once more in the King’s cause, when whether I be banged or hanged,
I care not.”

“I shall remember what you say, sir, should an opportunity occur,” said
the King; “and I wish his Majesty had many such subjects—I presume our
business is now settled?”

“When you shall have been pleased, sir, to give me a trifling scrap of
writing, to serve for my credentials—for such, you know, is the
custom—your written cartel hath its written answer.”

“That, sir, will I presently do,” said Charles, “and in good time, here
are the materials.”

“And, sir,” continued the envoy—“Ah!—ahem!—if you have interest in the
household for a cup of sack—I am a man of few words, and am somewhat
hoarse with much speaking—moreover, a serious business of this kind
always makes one thirsty.—Besides, sir, to part with dry lips argues
malice, which God forbid should exist in such an honourable
conjuncture.”

“I do not boast much influence in the house, sir,” said the King; “but
if you would have the condescension to accept of this broad piece
towards quenching your thirst at the George”—

“Sir,” said the cavalier, (for the times admitted of this strange
species of courtesy, nor was Wildrake a man of such peculiar delicacy
as keenly to dispute the matter,)—“I am once again beholden to you. But
I see not how it consists with my honour to accept of such
accommodation, unless you were to accompany and partake?”

“Pardon me, sir,” replied Charles, “my safety recommends that I remain
rather private at present.”

“Enough said,” Wildrake observed; “poor cavaliers must not stand on
ceremony.",9785,1700s
"After having sent the Slaves out of the _Elizabeth_, as I have
just now mentioned, I went on board my own Ship; and there being
then in the Road of _Anamaboe_, eight sail of Ships besides us, I
sent an Officer in my Boat to the Commanders of them, “To desire
their Company on board my Ship, because I had an Affair of great
Consequence to communicate to them.” Soon after, most of them
were pleased to come; and I having acquainted them with the whole
Matter, and they having also heard the Negroe’s Confession, “That
he had killed the white Man;” They unanimously advised me to put
him to death; arguing, “That Blood required Blood, by all Laws both
divine and human; especially as there was in this Case the clearest
Proof, namely the Murderer’s Confession: Moreover this would in all
probability prevent future Mischiefs; for by publickly executing this
Person at the Ship’s Fore-yard Arm, the Negroes on board their Ships
would see it; and as they were very much disposed to mutiny, it might
prevent them from attempting it.” These Reasons, with my being in
the same Circumstances, made me comply. Accordingly we acquainted the Negroe, that he was to die in an hour’s
time for murdering the white Man. He answered, “He must confess it
was a rash Action in him to kill him; but he desired me to consider,
that if I put him to death, I should lose all the Money I had paid
for him.” To this I bid the Interpreter reply, “That tho’ I knew it
was customary in his Country to commute for Murder by a Sum of Money,
yet it was not so with us; and he should find that I had no regard to
my Profit in this respect: For as soon as an Hour-Glass, just then
turned, was run out, he should be put to death;” At which I observed
he shewed no Concern. Hereupon the other Commanders went on board their respective
Ships, in order to have all their Negroes upon Deck at the time of
Execution, and to inform them of the occasion of it. The Hour-Glass
being run out, the Murderer was carried on the Ship’s Forecastle,
where he had a Rope fastened under his Arms, in order to be hoisted
up to the Fore-yard Arm, to be shot to death.",75052,1600s
"First, in a gentleman's house, one night the mistress considering why
such persons whom she expected were so late, and so long a coming, the
supper being all the while delayed for them; a servant man about the
house (finding the mistress anxious) having the second-sight, desires
to cover the table, and before all things were put on, those persons
she longed for would come in; which happened accordingly. The second instance, concerning a young Lady of great birth, whom a
rich Knight fancied and came in sute of the Lady, but she could not
endure to fancy him, being a harsh and unpleasant man: but her friends
importuning her daily, she turned melancholy and lean, fasting and
weeping continually. A common fellow about the house meeting her one
day in the fields, asked her, saying Mrs. Kate, What is that that
troubles you, and makes you look so ill ? she replied, that the cause
is known to many, for my friends would have me marry such a man by
name, but I cannot fancy him. Nay, (says the fellow) give over these
niceties, for he will be your first husband, and will not live long,
and be sure he will leave you a rich dowry, which will procure you a
great match, for I see a Lord upon each shoulder of you: all which
came to pass in every circumstance; as eye and ear witnesses declare.",4254,1600s
"ST. JEAN DE LUZ


During the winter of 1813, the Guards were stationed with head-quarters
at St Jean de Luz, and most comfortable we managed to make them. For
some short time previously we had been on scanty commons, and had
undergone considerable privation: indeed we might have said, like the
Colonel to Johnny Newcome on his arrival to join his regiment, ""We sons
of Mars have long been fed on brandy and cigars."" I had no cause to
complain personally; for my servant, a Sicilian, was one of the most
accomplished foragers (ill-natured persons might give him a worse name)
in the whole army; and when others were nearly starving, he always
managed to provide meat or poultry. He rode on his mule sometimes from
twenty to thirty miles, often running the greatest dangers, to procure
me a good meal; of which he took care to have, very justly, a large
share for himself. At St Jean de Luz, we were more attentive to our devotions than we had
been for some time.",3798,1700s
"As regards the
spiritual nature, which they name the soul, he is called the spiritual,

flesh, he is called the fleshly, outward, old man. The Apostle speaks of
this: ""Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day
by day"" (2 Cor. iv. 16). The result of this diversity is that in the
Scriptures opposing statements are made concerning the same man,
the fact being that in the same man these two men are opposed to one
another; the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh (Gal.",1911,1400s

"If, however, he could live as a prince in
Germany, the citizens would be very much gratified; and out of love
to those ancestors of whom he had spoken, they would be glad to assist
him."" To this, the count, in great anger, replied: ""He wished the
Florentines at a much greater distance."" Attempting no longer to
preserve the least urbanity of demeanor, he ceded the place and all
its dependencies to the Florentines, and with his treasure, wife, and
children, took his departure, mourning the loss of a territory which his
forefathers had held during four hundred years. When all these victories
were known at Florence, the government and people were transported
with joy. Benedetto de' Medici, finding the report of Niccolo having
proceeded either to Rome or to La Marca, incorrect, returned with his
forces to Neri, and they proceeded together to Florence, where the
highest honors were decreed to them which it was customary with the city
to bestow upon her victorious citizens, and they were received by the
Signory, the Capitani di Parte, and the whole city, in triumphal pomp.",2464,1400s

"As soon as he had learned the revolt of Genoa,
he ordered Niccolo Piccinino to proceed thither with all his cavalry
and whatever infantry he could raise, for the purpose of recovering
her, before the citizens had time to become settled and establish a
government; for he trusted greatly in the fortress within the city,
which was held for him. And although Niccolo drove the Genoese from
the mountains, took from them the valley of Pozeveri, where they had
entrenched themselves, and obliged them to seek refuge within the walls
of the city, he still found such an insurmountable obstacle in the
resolute defense of the citizens, that he was compelled to withdraw. On
this, at the suggestion of the Florentine exiles, he commanded Niccolo
to attack them on the eastern side, upon the confines of Pisa in the
Genoese territory, and to push the war with his utmost vigor, thinking
this plan would manifest and develop the course best to be adopted. Niccolo therefore besieged and took Serezana, and having committed great
ravages, by way of further alarming the Florentines he proceeded to
Lucca, spreading a report that it was his intention to go to Naples
to render assistance to the king of Aragon. Upon these new events Pope
Eugenius left Florence and proceeded to Bologna, where he endeavored
to effect an amicable arrangement between the league and the duke,
intimating to the latter, that if he would not consent to some treaty,
the pontiff must send Francesco Sforza to assist the league, for the
latter was now his confederate, and served in his pay.",2464,1400s

"There were tribunes with blinds prepared for the ambassadors and
Protestant ministers. There was another more magnificent for M. le Duc
d'Orleans and M. le Duc de Chartres, whom he took there. There were
places for the ladies, and as M. le Duc d'Orleans entered by the
monastery, and his tribune was within, it was open to all comers, so that
outside and inside were filled with refreshments of all kinds, which
officers distributed in profusion. This disorder continued all day, on
account of the large number of tables that were served without and within
for the subordinate people of the fete and all who liked to thrust
themselves in. The chief gentlemen of the chamber of M. le Duc
d'Orleans, and his chief officers did the business of the ceremony;
placed distinguished people in their seats, received them, conducted

considerable people, while, all the watch and all the police were

"[Sidenote: Kentucky remonstrance.] A remonstrance to the President and congress of the United States from
the inhabitants of Kentucky, respecting the navigation of the
Mississippi, was laid before the executive, and each branch of the
legislature. The style of this paper accorded well with the
instructions under which it had been prepared. In the language of an offended sovereign people, injured by the
maladministration of public servants, it demanded the use of the
Mississippi as a natural right which had been unjustly withheld; and
charged the government, openly, with being under the influence of a
local policy, which had prevented its making one single real effort
for the security of a good which was all essential to the prosperity
of the western people. Several intemperate aspersions upon the
legislative and executive departments, accompanied with complaints
that the course of the negotiations had not been communicated to those
who were interested in the event, and with threats obviously pointing
to dismemberment, were concluded with a declaration that nothing would
remunerate the western people for the suspension of this great
territorial right; that they must possess it; that the god of nature
had given them the means of acquiring and enjoying it; and that to
permit a sacrifice of it to any other considerations, would be a crime
against themselves and their posterity.",18595,1700s

"Let us
first consider Light; if a person be kept in darkness for some time,
and be then brought into a room in which there is only an ordinary
degree of light, it will be almost too oppressive for him, and appear
excessively bright; and if he have been kept for a considerable time
in a very dark place, the sensation will be very painful. In this
case, while the retina, or optic nerve, was deprived of light, its
excitability accumulated, or became more easily affected by light;
for if a person goes out of one room, into another which has an
equal degree of light, he will feel no effect. You may convince
yourselves of this law by a very simple experiment--shut your eyes,
and cover them for a minute or two with your hand, and endeavour not
to think of the light, or of what you are doing; then open them, and
the day-light will for a short time appear brighter. If you look
attentively at a window, for about two minutes, and then cast your
eyes upon a sheet of white paper, the shape of the window-frames
will be perfectly visible upon the paper; those parts which express
the wood-work, appearing brighter than the other parts. The parts of
the optic nerve on which the image of the frame falls, are covered
by the wood-work from the action of the light; the excitability of
these portions of the nerve will therefore accumulate, and the parts
of the paper which fall upon them, must of course appear brighter.",18376,1700s

country, he had said to himself about people met in society: “One sees
them in this place and that, and one even talks with them; but to find
out what they _do_ one would really have to be a detective.”  In respect
to several individuals whose work he was the opposite of “drawn
to”—perhaps he was wrong—he found himself adding “No wonder they conceal
it—when it’s so bad!”  He noted that oftener than in France and in
Germany his artist looked like a gentleman—that is like an English
one—while, certainly outside a few exceptions, his gentlemen didn’t look
like an artist. St. George was not one of the exceptions; that
circumstance he definitely apprehended before the great man had turned
his back to walk off with Miss Fancourt. He certainly looked better
behind than any foreign man of letters—showed for beautifully correct in
his tall black hat and his superior frock coat. Somehow, all the same,
these very garments—he wouldn’t have minded them so much on a
weekday—were disconcerting to Paul Overt, who forgot for the moment that
the head of the profession was not a bit better dressed than himself. He

and a pair of eyes surely never visited by a fine frenzy, and he promised
himself to study these denotements on the first occasion.",898,1800s

chaplain at the evening prayers there held in his hand a lighted candle,

glancing all around him, cast his eye upon me, and told the valet to give

"CHAP. III. _Of the Rebuilding of_ Byzantium _by_ Constantine the Great, _and the
  Largeness of it in his Time_. It is recorded by _Zonaras_, that _Constantine_ being inclinable
to build a City, and to give it his own Name, at first pitch’d
upon _Sardicus_ a Field of _Asia_; afterwards, upon the Promontory
_Sigeum_, and last of all upon _Chalcedon_ and _Byzantium_, for that
Purpose. _Georgius Cedrinus_ is of Opinion, that he first pitch’d
upon _Thessalonica_, and after he had lived there two Years, being
wonderfully taken with the Delightfulness of the Place, he built
the most magnificent Temples, _Bagnio’s_ and _Aqueducts_; but being
interrupted in his great Designs by the Plague which raged there, he
was obliged to leave it, and passing away for _Chalcedon_, (formerly
overthrown by the _Persians_, but then upon rebuilding) he was directed
by the Eagles frequently carrying the small Stones of the Workmen
from thence to _Byzantium_, where _Constantinople_ ought to be built.",53083,1400s
"The wind blew
strong, and howled among the rocks. The rain fell, and drenched the
few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches. Again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring
afternoon, and sometimes, for a week together, there would be rain,
nothing but rain, all day, and then the most lovely cloudless night,
with the sky all out in full-blown stars--not one missing. But the
princess could not see much of them, for she went to bed early. The
winter drew on, and she found things growing dreary.",708,1800s

beaten. “Here they come,” Jeff Hall announced satisfiedly, and spat into the
sand as a tiny blue puff of smoke showed beside one of the dots, and two
other dots began to grow perceptibly larger within a yellow cloud which

      Gather and float in the airy plain;
   The nightingale sings to the dewy cedar,
      The cedar scatters his scent to the main. The strange flowers’ perfume turns to singing,
      Heard afar over moonlit seas:
   The Siren’s song, grown faint in winging,
      Falls in scent on the cedar trees. As waifs blown out of the sunset, flying,
      Purple, and rosy, and grey, the birds
   Brighten the air with their wings; their crying
      Wakens a moment the weary herds.",1060,1800s

So he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight. Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense. But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.",1514,1500s

"He was a kind of hanger-on, I was told, of the
establishment, and though ostensibly a resident of the village, was
oftener to be found in the Squire's kitchen than his own home, the old
gentleman being fond of the sound of ""harp in hall."" The dance, like most dances after supper, was a merry one; some of the
older folks joined in it, and the Squire himself figured down several
couples with a partner with whom he affirmed he had danced at every
Christmas for nearly half a century. Master Simon, who seemed to be a
kind of connecting link between the old times and the new, and to
be withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments,
evidently piqued himself on his dancing, and was endeavouring to gain
credit by the heel and toe, rigadoon, and other graces of the ancient
school; but he had unluckily assorted himself with a little romping girl
from boarding-school, who, by her wild vivacity, kept him continually on
the stretch, and defeated all his sober attempts at elegance;--such are
the ill-assorted matches to which antique gentlemen are unfortunately
prone! The young Oxonian, on the contrary, had led out one of his maiden aunts,
on whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity; he
was full of practical jokes, and his delight was to tease his aunts and
cousins; yet, like all madcap youngsters, he was a universal favourite
among the women. The most interesting couple in the dance was the
young officer and a ward of the Squire's, a beautiful blushing girl of
seventeen.",1850,1700s

"They were, moreover, sent by that Pope to S. Maria at Orvieto, where
they made a number of marble figures for the façade of the church,
which were very tolerable for those times. But among the others who
assisted Giovanni in his undertakings for the Vescovado at Arezzo,
were Agostino and Agnolo, sculptors and architects of Siena, who far
surpassed all the others, as will be said in the proper place. But
to return to Giovanni. When he left Orvieto he came to Florence to
see Arnolfo's building of S. Maria del Fiore, and also to see Giotto,
of whom he had heard a great deal elsewhere; but no sooner had he
arrived in Florence than he was appointed by the intendants of the

warrant for conducting me and my retinue to _Traldragdubh_, or

remember), by a party of ten horse. All my retinue was that poor lad
for an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble
request, we had each of us a mule to ride on. A messenger was
despatched half a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of
my approach, and to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a
day and hour, when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have
the honour to lick the dust before his footstool.” This is the court
style, and I found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my
admittance two days after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my
belly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a
stranger, care was taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was
not offensive. However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any

would accord nothing except promises in order to guarantee to Europe that
the two crowns should never be united upon the same head. His authority
was wounded at the idea of being called upon to admit, as it were, a
rival near it. Absolute without reply, as he had become, he had
extinguished and absorbed even the minutest trace, idea, and recollection
of all other authority, all other power in France except that which
emanated from himself alone. The English, little accustomed to such

which I have paid so dear. The Count d'Estaing arrived the day before
in Boston. I found him much displeased at a protest of which you have
heard, and many other circumstances which I have reported to you: I did
what I could on the occasion; but I must do the admiral the justice
to say that it has not at all diminished his warm desire of serving
America. We waited together on the council, General Heath, General
Hancock, and were very well satisfied with them; the last one
distinguished himself very much by his zeal on the occasion. Some people
in Boston were rather dissatisfied; but when they saw the behaviour of
the council, Generals Heath and Hancock, they, I hope, will do the
same; I, therefore, fear nothing but delays.",8376,1700s

am inclined to think he was no stranger to it. He was a young man of
great penetration, and still greater discretion; who never belied his
sentiments, but did not always speak them: without giving me the least
hint that he was acquainted with our intimacy, he appeared by his conduct
to be so; nor did this moderation proceed from baseness of soul, but,
having entered entirely into the principles of his mistress, he could not
reasonably disapprove of the natural consequences of them. Though as
young as herself, he was so grave and thoughtful, that he looked on us as
two children who required indulgence, and we regarded him as a
respectable man, whose esteem we had to preserve. It was not until after
she was unfaithful to Anet, that I learned the strength of her attachment
to him. She was fully sensible that I only thought, felt, or lived for
her; she let me see, therefore, how much she loved Anet, that I might
love him likewise, and dwell less on her friendship, than on her esteem,

conform to it; and the more so, as no great difficulty attends it;
nothing, indeed, being requisite but to begin in good earnest, as
the above-mentioned Cicero affirms, and all those who now live
in this manner. Plato, you will say, though he himself lived very
regularly, affirms, notwithstanding, that, in republics, men
cannot do so, being often obligated to expose themselves to heat,
cold, and several other kinds of hardship, and other things,
which are all so many disorders, and incompatable with a regular
life. I answer, as I have already observed, that these are not
disorders attended with any bad consequence, or which affect
either health or life, when the man, who undergoes them, observes
the rules of sobriety, and commits no excess in the two points
concerning diet, which a republican may very well avoid, nay it
is requisite he should avoid; because, by so doing, he may be
sure either to escape those disorders, which, otherwise, it
would be no easy matter for him to escape while exposed to these
hardships; or, in case he could not escape them, he may more
easily and speedily prevent their bad effects. Here it may be objected, and some actually object, that he,
who leads a regular life, having constantly, when well, made
use of food fit for the sick, and in small quantities, has no
resource left in case of illness. To this I might, in the
first place, answer, that nature, desirous to preserve man
in good health as long as possible, informs him, herself, how
he is to act in time of illness; for she immediately deprives
him, when sick, of his appetite, in order that he may eat but
little; because nature (as I have said already) is satisfied
with little; wherefore, it is requisite, that a man, when
sick, whether he has been  a regular or irregular liver, should
use no meats, but such as are suited to his disorder; and of
these even in a much smaller quantity than he was wont to do,
when in health.",30660,1400s
"In the mean time, the King and Queen of Spain, distressed beyond measure
at the loss of their favourite, thought only of the best means of
obtaining her recall. They plotted with such ministers as were
favourable to her; they openly quarrelled with and thwarted those who
were her opponents, so that the most important matters perished in their
hands. Nay more, upon the King of Spain's return, the Queen persuaded
him to oppose in all things the wishes of the King (Louis XIV. ), his
grandfather, and to neglect his counsels with studied care. Our King
complained of this with bitterness.",3863,1600s

"To speak the truth, the professors in England, though many of
them suffered much at the hands of the prelates, yet they had a great
advantage of the Separatists; for the Separatists had not only the

by what is before declared), but also they must endure the frowns,
and many times the sharp invectives, of the forward ministers against
them, both in public and private; and what influence they had upon the

him to live on nine pence a week, with roots boiled, either the people

"A geometrician exactly knew the different energies acting in each case,
with the properties of the particles moved, could demonstrate that after
the causes given, each particle acted precisely as it ought to act, and
that it could not have acted otherwise than it did. In those terrible convulsions that sometimes agitate political
societies, shake their foundations, and frequently produce the overthrow
of an empire; there is not a single action, a single word, a single
thought, a single will, a single passion in the agents, whether they act
as destroyers, or as victims, that is not the necessary result of the
causes operating; that does not act, as, of necessity, it must act, from
the peculiar essence of the beings who give the impulse, and that of the
agents who receive it, according to the situation these agents fill in
the moral whirlwind. This could be evidently proved by an understanding
capacitated to rate all the action and re-action, of the minds and
bodies of those who contributed to the revolution. In fact, if all be connected in Nature, if all motion be produced,
the one from the other, notwithstanding their secret communications
frequently elude our sight; we ought to feel convinced of this truth,
that there is no cause, however minute, however remote, that does not
sometimes produce the greatest and most immediate effects on man. It
may, perhaps, be in the parched plains of Lybia, that are amassed
the first elements of a storm or tempest, which, borne by the winds,
approach our climate, render our atmosphere dense, and thus operating
on the temperament, may influence the passions of a man, whose

Fleet of the _Megarians_, who transplanted a Colony thither. I am of
Opinion, that this was the same Person with _Byzas_. For had it taken
its Name from _Byzes_, this City had more properly been call’d _Byzeum_
than _Byzantium_. _Philostratus_, in the Life of _Marcus_ a Sophist of
_Byzantium_, calls the Admiral of that Fleet by the Name of _Byzas_,
when he informs us, that _Marcus_ (whom he would have descended from
the ancient Family of _Byzas_) made a Voyage to _Megara_, and was

"Now that the pressure is greater, may (as I
shewed before in the explication of the third _Figure_) be evinced from the
flatting of the water in the middle, which arises from the gravity of the
under _fluid_: for since, as I shewed before, if there were no gravity in
the under _fluid_, or that it were equal to that of the upper, the
terminating Surface would be _Spherical_, and since it is the additional
pressure of the gravity of water that makes it so flat, it follows, that
the pressure upon the middle must be greater then towards the sides. Hence
the Ball having a stronger pressure against that side of it which respects
the middle of the _superficies_, then against that which respects the
_approximate_ side, must necessarily move towards that part, from whence it
finds least resistance, and so be _accelerated_, as the resistance
decrease. Hence the more the water is raised under that part of its way it
is passing above the middle, the faster it is moved: And therefore you will
find it to move faster in E then in D, and in D then in C. Neither could I
find the floating substance to be moved at all, until it were placed upon
some part of the _Superficies_ that was sensibly elevated above the height
of the middle part. Now that this may be the true cause, you may try with a
blown Bladder, and an exactly round Ball upon a very smooth side of some
pliable body, as _Horn_ or _Quicksilver._ For if the Ball be placed under a
part of the Bladder which is upon one side of the middle of its pressure,
and you press strongly against the Bladder, you shall find the Ball moved
from the middle towards the sides. Having therefore shewn the reason of the motion of any float towards the
sides, the reason of the incursion of any two floating bodies will easily
appear: For the rising of the water against the sides of either of them, is
an Argument sufficient, to shew the pressure of the Air to be there less,
then it is further from it, where it is not so much elevated; and therefore
the reason of the motion of the other toward it, will be the same as
towards the side of the Glass, only here from the same reason, they are
mutually moved toward each other, whereas the side of the Glass in the
former remains fixt.",15491,1600s

"In a country, the
peculiar defects of which were already a deficiency of capital, and
a redundancy of population, such a check to the means of employing
labour must be attended with no common distress. In Ireland, it is
quite certain, that there are no mercantile capitals ready to take
up those persons who are thus thrown out of work, and even in Great
Britain the transfer will be slow and difficult. Our commerce and manufactures, therefore, must increase very
considerably before they can restore the demand for labour already
lost; for the and a moderate increase beyond this will scarcely make
up disadvantage of a low money price of wages. These wages will finally be determined by the usual money price of
corn, and the state of the demand for labour. There is a difference between what may be called the usual price of
corn and the average price, which has not been sufficiently attended
to.",4335,1700s
"This beer is collected and
put into vats. Mr. Barclay also states that it contains a certain
portion of brown stout, which is twenty shillings a barrel dearer than
common beer; and some bottling beer, which is ten shillings a barrel
dearer;[68] and that all these beers, united, are put into vats, and
that it depends upon various circumstances, how long they may remain in
those vats before they become perfectly bright. When bright, this beer
is sent out to the publicans, for their _entire_ beer, and there is
sometimes a small quantity of mild beer mixed with it."" The present entire beer, therefore, is a very heterogeneous mixture,
composed of all the waste and spoiled beer of the publicans--the bottoms
of butts--the leavings of the pots--the drippings of the machines for
drawing the beer--the remnants of beer that lay in the leaden pipes of
the brewery, with a portion of brown stout, bottling beer, and mild
beer. The old or _entire_ beer we have examined, as obtained from Messrs.
Barclay's, and other eminent London brewers, is unquestionably a good

brewers, to brew beer on purpose for keeping, or to keep it twelve or

"To conclude this, this is that celestiall fire which was
shadowed out unto us by that poore element in comparison, and beggarly
rudiment, the fire (I meane) of such necessary use in the law, which

heaven, that it might cause the Sacrifices to ascend thither againe, as
a sweet incense unto the Lord, without which no burnt offering was
acceptable. _The Second Part._

report and surmize even on those that offer the right fire, & serve the
Lord in spirit and truth: yet for their sakes is the name of zeale

must bee laid, lest such as have not their senses exercised to put a

_Of their Habits, and Way of Dressing._


Their clothes are, for the most part, made of rein deer and seal skin,
as also of bird’s skin nicely dressed and prepared. The men’s habits are
a coat or jacket, with a cap or hood sewed to it, to cover the head and
shoulders, in the fashion of a domino, or monk’s hood. This coat reaches
down to the knees.",58308,1600s

"He answered, ‘Yes.’ Then
he was reminded of the evil which arose when bishops, seeing their power
in a Congregation, began to exalt themselves, and to make outward show
of their pre-eminence. He was asked whether he would recognize as evil,
abjure, and at once suppress any inclination he might feel toward pride
in his position as Chief Elder, and his larger authority. He answered
with a grave and thoughtful ‘Yes.’ Then our Nitschmann prayed over him
earnestly, and ordained him to his office with the laying on of hands. Nitschmann was uncommonly aroused and happy, but Anton Seifert was
very humble and quiet.” John Wesley, who was present, wrote “The great
simplicity, as well as solemnity, of the whole, almost made me forget
the seventeen hundred years between, and imagine myself in one of those
assemblies where form and state were not; but Paul the tent-maker, or
Peter the fisherman, presided; yet with the demonstration of the Spirit
and of power.”

Both Wesley and Benjamin Ingham refer to Seifert as a “bishop”, which is
a mistake, though a natural one. Wesley was present at the ordination,
and heard the charge, with example and warning drawn from the actions
of earlier bishops; while Ingham, in the course of several long
conversations with Toeltschig concerning the Moravian Episcopate and
Seifert’s ordination, asked “is Anton a bishop?” and was answered,
“yes, FOR OUR CONGREGATION.” This was in view of the fact that Bishop
Nitschmann, in ordaining Seifert, had empowered him to delegate another
member to hold the Communion, baptize, or perform the marriage ceremony
in case of his sickness or necessary absence.",570,1800s

"It must be confessed, that many of the good effects, of which Religion
is productive to political societies, would be produced even by a false
Religion, which should prescribe good morals, and should be able to
enforce its precepts by sufficient sanctions. Of this nature are those
effects, which depend on our calling in the aid of a Being who sees the
heart, in order to assist the weakness, and in various ways to supply
the inherent defects of all human jurisprudence. But the superior
excellence of Christianity in this respect must be acknowledged, both in
the superiority of her moral code, and in the powerful motives and
efficacious means which she furnishes for enabling us to practise it;
and in the tendency of her doctrines to provide for the observance of
her precepts, by producing tempers of mind which correspond with them. But, more than all this; it has not perhaps been enough remarked, that
true Christianity, from her essential nature, appears peculiarly and
powerfully adapted to promote the preservation and healthfulness of
political communities. What is in truth their grand malady?",25709,1700s

"To instance in
_Virgil_: ""Arms and the Man I sing; the first who from the Shores of
_Troy_ (the Fugitive of Heav'n) came to _Italy_ and the _Lavinian_
Coast."" Here you perceive the Subject-matter is retarded by the
_Inversion of the Phrase_, and by that _Parenthesis_, the _Fugitive of
Heaven_ all which occasions _Delay_; and _Delay_ (as a learned Writer
upon a Passage of this nature in _Tasso_ observes) is the Property of
Majesty: For which Reason when _Virgil_ represents _Dido_ in her
greatest Pomp, it is,

  --_Reginam_ cunctantem _ad limina primi_
  _Poenorum expectant_.--

For the same Reason he introduces the most solemn and most important
Speech in the _Æneid_, with three Monosyllables, which causes great
Delay in the Speaker, and gives great Majesty to the Speech. --_O Qui Res_ Hominumq; Deumq;--

These three Syllables occasion three short Pauses. _O--Qui--Res_--How
slow and how stately is this Passage! But it happens that I can set the Beginning of the _Æneid_ in a clear
Light for my purpose, by two Translations of that Passage, both by the
same Hand; one of which is exactly in the manner of _Virgil_, the
other in the manner of _Homer_: The two Translations are made by the
Reverend Mr. _Pitt_.",17548,1600s
"He took off his hat to her and bade her good-day; he remarked
that he was going to row across the pond, and begged that she would do
him the honor to accompany him. She looked at him a moment; then,
without saying anything, she turned away. But she soon reappeared below
in one of those quaint and charming Leghorn hats, tied with white satin
bows, that were worn at that period; she also carried a green parasol. She went with him to the edge of the lake, where a couple of boats were
always moored; they got into one of them, and Felix, with gentle
strokes, propelled it to the opposite shore. The day was the perfection
of summer weather; the little lake was the color of sunshine; the plash
of the oars was the only sound, and they found themselves listening to
it.",179,1800s

"But antecedent to this, they first
present themselves to the monthly meeting for the affairs of the church
where they reside; there declaring their intentions to take one another
as husband and wife, if the said meeting have nothing material to object
against it. They are constantly asked the necessary questions, {25} as
in case of parents or guardians, if they have acquainted them with their
intention, and have their consent, &c.  The method of the meeting is, to
take a minute thereof, and to appoint proper persons to inquire of their
conversation and clearness from all others, and whether they have
discharged their duty to their parents or guardians; and to make report
thereof to the next monthly meeting, where the same parties are desired
to give their attendance. {26}  In case it appears they have proceeded
orderly, the meeting passes their proposal, and so records it in their
meeting book. And in case the woman be a widow, and hath children, due
care is there taken that provision also be made by her for the orphans,
before the meeting pass the proposals of marriage: advising the parties
concerned, to appoint a convenient time and place, and to give fitting
notice to their relations, and such friends and neighbours, as they
desire should be the witnesses of their marriage: where they take one
another by the hand, and by name promise reciprocally, love and fidelity,
after the manner before expressed. Of all which proceedings, a narrative
in way of certificate is made, to which the said parties first set their

"Let the terms therefore remain, but endeavour to afford
them a fixed and definite meaning, and suffer them to be so far
analysed, as to detect their composition, and discover the reasons which
imposed them. In this endeavour there will, however, be found
considerable difficulty; especially as the minds of men are not yet
agreed respecting the process, by which it is to be performed. There are, however, only two modes, to which we can resort, for the
definite meaning of words; namely, etymology and authority. Considering
the history of our own language, and the nature of its composition, we
are enabled satisfactorily to investigate, not only the primitive sense
of our terms, but likewise their exact signification, in the languages
from whence we imported them: for there still remain, sufficient
authentic materials, in our Saxon and Norman records, to verify their
original meaning. If we enquire into the causes, which have operated to
deflect these terms from their primitive sense, we shall find authority
to be the principal source of such corruption; and this infirmity
appears to have pervaded most of the languages of those nations which
have produced poets, orators, and metaphysicians.",31747,1700s

"Certainly this _Tyrian Hercules_ could be no older
than the _Trojan_ war, because the _Tyrians_ did not begin to navigate the
_Mediterranean_ 'till after that war: for _Homer_ and _Hesiod_ knew nothing
of this navigation, and the _Tyrian Hercules_ went to the coasts of
_Spain_, and was buried in _Gades_: so _Arnobius_ [114]; _Tyrius Hercules
sepultus in finibus Hispaniæ_: and _Mela_, speaking of the Temple of
_Hercules_ in _Gades_, saith, _Cur sanctum sit ossa ejus ibi sepulta
efficiunt_. _Carthage_ [115] paid tenths to this _Hercules_, and sent their
payments yearly to _Tyre_: and thence it's probable that this _Hercules_
went to the coast of _Afric_, as well as to that of _Spain_, and by his
discoveries prepared the way to _Dido_: _Orosius_ [116] and others tell us
that he built _Capsa_ there. _Josephus_ tells of an earlier _Hercules_, to
whom _Hiram_ built a Temple at _Tyre_: and perhaps there might be also an
earlier _Hercules_ of _Tyre_, who set on foot their trade on the _Red Sea_
in the days of _David_ or _Solomon_. _Tatian_, in his book against the _Greeks_, relates, that amongst the
_Phœnicians_ flourished three ancient Historians, _Theodotus_, _Hysicrates_
and _Mochus_, _who all of them delivered in their histories, translated
into _Greek_ by _Latus_, under which of the Kings happened the rapture of
_Europa_; the voyage of _Menelaus_ into _Phœnicia_; and the league and
friendship between _Solomon_ and _Hiram_, when _Hiram_ gave his daughter to
_Solomon_, and furnished him with timber for building the Temple: and that
the same is affirmed by _Menander_ of _Pergamus__. _Josephus_ [117] lets us
know that the Annals of the _Tyrians_, from the days of _Abibalus_ and
_Hiram_, Kings of _Tyre_, were extant in his days; and that _Menander_ of
_Pergamus_ translated them into _Greek_, and that _Hiram_'s friendship to
_Solomon_, and assistance in building the Temple, was mentioned in them;
and that the Temple was founded in the eleventh year of _Hiram_: and by the
testimony of _Menander_ and the ancient _Phœnician_ historians, the rapture
of _Europa_, and by consequence the coming of her brother _Cadmus_ into
_Greece_, happened within the time of the Reigns of the Kings of _Tyre_
delivered in these histories; and therefore not before the Reign of
_Abibalus_, the first of them, nor before the Reign of King _David_ his
contemporary.",15784,1600s

"These rules are
certainly the most rational, and in the best taste, when they can be
observed, and, on the whole, they lead perhaps to the fewest
embarrassments; always so, if there happen to be none but the well-bred
present, since seats become of little consideration where no importance
is attached to them. I confess to some manoeuvring in my time, to get
near, or away from a fire, out of a draught, or next some agreeable
woman; but the idea whether I was at the head or the foot of the table
never crossed my mind: and yet here, where they do mean the salt to come
into the account, I begin to take care that they do not ""bite their
thumbs"" at me. Two or three little things have occurred in my presence,
which show that all our people do not even understand the ways of their
own good society. A very young man lately, under the impression that
gallantry required it, led one of the most distinguished women in the
room to the table, merely because he happened to be next her, at the
moment dinner was announced. This was certainly a failure even in
American etiquette, every woman being more disposed to appreciate the

nightmare, through the blue glow, and it scarcely seemed real when a
patch of night sky showed through the exit before them, and when they
stumbled panting out into the clean cold air of the mountainside, and
saw the white radiance of moonrise over the Barrier cliffs above them. They sank down to catch their breath on a rock not far from the tunnel. They'd made it none too soon--only a minute or two had passed when the

my word, while the exercise of my reason is vouchsafed to me. That you
are happy and prosperous is some consolation, and my situation requires
it all.”

This letter filled Ravenswood with the most lively alarm. He made many

precautions had been taken to prevent the possibility of their

_UEESR Foreign Minister Dzhoubinsky to Maxim G. Krylenkoff, Ambassador
at Nanking:_


3 March, 1984

Comrade Ambassador:

It is desired that you make immediate secret and confidential repeat
secret and confidential inquiry as to the whereabouts of Dr. Dimitri
O. Voronoff, the noted Soviet rocket expert, designer of the new
guided missile _Marxist Victory_, who vanished a week ago from the
Josef Vissarionovitch Djugashvli Reaction-Propulsion Laboratories at
Molotovgorod.",18261,1900s
"His ground car remained where he had parked it--in an
area clearly marked _No Parking_. They'd left him an old car that wasn't worth shipping to the stars. How
long it would last was anybody's guess. The government hadn't been
deliberately illiberal in leaving him such a shabby vehicle; if there
had been any way to ensure a continuing supply of fuel, they would
probably have left him a reasonably good one. But, since only a little
could be left, allowing him a good car would have been simply an example
of conspicuous waste, and the government had always preferred its waste
to be inconspicuous.",29791,1900s
"And perceiving that this Truth, _I think_, therefore, _I am_,
was so firm and certain, that all the most extravagant suppositions of
the Scepticks was not able to shake it, I judg'd that I might receive it
without scruple for the first principle of the Philosophy I sought. Examining carefully afterwards what I was; and seeing that I could
suppose that I had no _body_, and that there was no _World_, nor any
_place_ where I was: but for all this, I could not feign that I _was
not_; and that even contrary thereto, thinking to doubt the truth of
other things, it most evidently and certainly followed, That _I was_:
whereas, if I had ceas'd to _think_, although all the rest of what-ever
I had imagined were true, I had no reason to beleeve that _I had been_. I knew then that I was a substance, whose whole essence or nature is,
but to _think_, and who to _be_, hath need of no place, nor depends on
any materiall thing. So that this _Me_, to wit, my Soul, by which I am
what I am, is wholly distinct from the Body, and more easie to be known
then _it_; and although _that_ were not, it would not therefore cease to
be what it is. After this I considered in generall what is requisite in a Proposition
to make it true and certain: for since I had found out one which I knew
to be so, I thought I ought also to consider wherein that certainty
consisted: and having observed, That there is nothing at all in this, _I
think_, therefore _I am_, which assures me that I speak the truth,
except this, that I see most cleerly, That _to think_, one must have a
_being_; I judg'd that I might take for a generall rule, That those
things which we conceive cleerly and distinctly, are all true; and that
the onely difficulty is punctually to observe what those are which we
distinctly conceive.",25830,1500s

"And as the Solemnity of
these Matters requir'd peculiar Hands to Execute them; and Devotion
exacted that such should be liberally rewarded, and highly respected
for their Pious performances; from hence the profit which some reap'd
by these things, as well as the satisfaction that others found
therein, who were unwilling to be rigorously restrain'd by the Rule of
their Actions, yet were uneasie under the reproaches of their
Consciences when they transgressed against it, made these Inventions,
and the value set upon them, to be daily improv'd; till Men at last
have sought to be, and have effectually been perswaded that they
might render themselves acceptable to God without indeavouring
sincerely to obey the Rule by which they profess'd to believe they
were oblig'd to live; and that even when they did think that this was
a Law giv'n them by God himself. Now the great practicers, and promoters of the abovesaid things, are
every where Those who are generally esteem'd, and call'd _Religious_. Whence the Term _Religion_ appears ordinarily to have stood for
nothing else, but _some Expedient, or other, found out to satisfy Men
that God was satisfied with them, notwithstanding that their
Consciences reproach'd them with want of Conformity to the
acknowledg'd Rule, or Law of their Actions._

Having premis'd thus much concerning the Notions Men vulgarly have had
of _Vertue_ and _Religion,_ let us now proceed to see how it has come
to pass, That they have with Allowance, Approbation, and oftentimes,
with injunction of their Lawmakers and Governours, transgress'd
against the most visible Dictates of the Law of Nature, or Reason, in
Things not favourable to their Natural Passions and Appetites; but
even, sometimes, contrary thereunto; as are denying themselves the
lawfullest Enjoyments of Life; Macerating their Bodies; Prostituting
their Wives; and exposing their Off-spring and Themselves to cruel
Torments, and even Death it self. The cause of which I think appears
plainly to be; that Mankind having been generally convinc'd that there
was a Maker of themselves and of the World, who they concluded was as
well able to take cognisance of what they did, as to produce them into
Being; and to whom they could not believe that all the Actions of his
Creatures were alike pleasing, or displeasing; they became fearful
(as has been said) of incurring his displeasure, whenever they did
any thing which their Consciences reproach'd them for: From the which
Fear of a Superior invisible Power, inspecting their Actions, they
were early induc'd to hearken to, and follow such who profess'd
themselves to have some Knowledge Supernaturally reveal'd to them of
God's Will. And we find, in the Histories of all Nations, that the
generality of Mankind were perswaded (contrary to the Sentiments of
some Modern Deists) That it was a thing very congruous to the Divine
Being, that he should in this way reveal to Men his pleasure
concerning them; since the greatest part, every where, did with little
difficulty give Credit to such who had the confidence to affirm to
them, that they were sent by God to teach them what he required of
them: the which being so, a submission of Mens Reason to the dictates
of suppos'd inspir'd Teachers must necessarily follow: and they from
thence become liable to be impos'd upon, all the ways that could serve
the ends of such who made use of this pretence to promote thereby any
Interest of their own, or others.",13285,1600s
"For there is a necessity of taking with them a great
number of _Indians_, that they may gain a great sum of Mony by their
Sale, now the Ships are very slenderly furnished with Provisions and
Water in small Quantity, to satisfie few, left the Tyrants, who are
term'd Owners or Proprietors of Ships should be at too great expence in
Victualling their Vessels, nay they scarce carry Food enough with them
to maintain the _Spaniards_ that manage the Vessel, which is the reason
so many _Indians_ dye with Hunger and Thirst, and of necessity they
must be thrown over-board: Nay one of them told me this for a Truth,
that there being such a Multitude of Men thus destroy'd, a Ship may
sail from the Isle of _Lucaya_ to _Hispaniola_, which is a Voyage of
Twenty Leagues and upward, without Chart or Compass, by the sole
Direction or Observation of dead fluctuating Carkasses. But afterward, when arriv'd, and driven up into the Isle whither they
are brought to be sold, there is no Person that is in some small
measure compassionate, but would be extreamly mov'd and discompos'd at
the sight; _viz._ to spie old Men and Women, together with Naked
Children half starv'd. Then they separate Parents from Children, Wives
from their Husbands, about Ten or Twenty in a Company, and cast lots
for them, that the Detestable Owners of the Ships may have their share;
who prepare Two or Three Ships, and equip them as a Fleet of Pirates,
going ashore ravaging and forcing Men out of their Houses, and then
robbing them: But when the lot of any one of them falls upon a parcel,
that hath an aged or diseased Man; the Tyrant, whose Allotment he is,
usually bursts out, as followeth. Let this old Fellow be Damm'd, why do
you bestow him upon me; must I, think you; be at the charge of his
Burial? And this sickly Wretch, how comes he to be one of my alloted

"And this I do maintain according to God
 and my own Conscience, as far as I could possibly learn, that the
 Inhabitants of _Perusia_ never promoted or raised any Commotion or
 Rebellion, though as it is manifest to all Men, they were afflicted
 with Evil Dealings and Cruel Torments: And they, not without Cause, the
 _Spaniards_ breaking their Faith and Word, betraying the Truth and
 Tyrannically contrary to all Law and Justice, destroying them and the
 whole Country, inflicting on them great Injuries and Losses, were more
 reay to prepare themselves for Death, than still to fall at once into
 such great and irrecoverable Miseries. Nay I do declare, according to Information from the _Indians_
 themselves, that there are to this day far greater Quantities of Gold
 kept hid and concealed than ever were yet detected or brought to light,
 which by means of the _Spanish_ Injustice and Cruelty, they would not
 then, nor ever will discover so long as they are so barbarously
 treated, but will rather chose to dye with the Herd. Whereat the Lord
 God is highly offended and the King hath very ill Offices done him, for
 he is hereby defrauded of this Region, which was sufficiently able to
 furnish all _Castile_ with Necessaries, the Recovery whereof can never
 be expected without great difficulty and vast Expenses. Thus far I have acquainted you with the very words of this Religious
_Franciscan_, ratified by the Bishop of _Mexico_, who testifieth that
the said Frier _Marc_ did affirm and maintain what is above-mentioned. Here it is to be observ'd what this said Frier was an Eye-Witness of;
for he travelled up in this Countrey Fifty or a Hundred Miles, for the
space of Nine or Ten Years, when as yet, few _Spaniards_ had got
footing there, but afterward, at the noise of Gold to be had there in
great plenty, Four or Five Thousand came thither, who spread themselves
through those Kingdoms and Provinces the space of Five or Six Hundred
Miles, which they made wholly desloate, committing the same, or greater
Cruelies than are before recited; for in reality they destroyed from
that time to these very days, above an Hundred Thousand poor Souls more
than he gives an Account of, and with less fear of God and the King,
nay with less Mercy have they destroyed the greatest part of Mankind in
these Kingdoms, above Four Millions suffering by violent Death.",20321,1400s
"This people must cease to hold slaves, and to
make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people. In their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does anyone think that
Massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis? “A drab of state, a cloth-o’-silver slut,
  To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt.”

Practically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts are
not a hundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundred thousand
merchants and farmers here, who are more interested in commerce and
agriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do
justice to the slave and to Mexico, _cost what it may_. I quarrel not
with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home, co-operate with,
and do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would
be harmless. We are accustomed to say, that the mass of men are

this dreadful situation did we spend some hours, incessantly moving
from one end of the brick to the other; for the moment she had, by the
entrance of her paw at one end, driven us to the other, she stepped
over, and again made us retreat. Think with what dreadful terror our
little hearts must have been oppressed, to see our mortal enemy so
closely watching us, expecting every moment when she shook the brick
with her two forepaws in searching, and with her mouth endeavoured to
lift it up, that she would be so far able to effect her purpose, as to
make it impossible for us to escape her jaws. But, happily for us, it
had somehow or other got so wedged that she could not move it to any
distance; though it kept momentarily increasing our terrors, by shaking
as she strove to turn it. From this state of horror, however, we were at length delivered by a
little boy of about two years old, who came out of the house, and taking
the cat up round its body with both hands, tottered away with it, and

object of pleasing God. Only we are not yet fully created anew in
perfect faith and love; these require to be increased, not, however,

any other duty of his office, is not consecrated as bishop by these

have from Christ Himself is rightly taught, and we are shown in what
manner all we Christians are kings and priests, and how we are lords of
all things, and may be confident that whatever we do in the presence of
God is pleasing and acceptable to Him. Whose heart would not rejoice in its inmost core at hearing these
things? Whose heart, on receiving so great a consolation, would not
become sweet with the love of Christ, a love to which it can never
attain by any laws or works? Who can injure such a heart, or make it
afraid? If the consciousness of sin or the horror of death rush in upon
it, it is prepared to hope in the Lord, and is fearless of such evils,

this the whole city arose, and it was all the magistrates could do to
restrain these families, and prevent the actual occurrence of a disaster
which, without being the fault of either of them, had been willfully
though falsely reported as having already taken place. This apparently
trifling circumstance served to inflame the minds of the parties, and
make each the more resolved to increase the number of their followers. And as the citizens, since the ruin of the nobility, were on such an

previously been, they designed to proceed toward the suppression of this

differs, which, because of very great and manifest abuses doubtless

the end that the doctrine of our teachers on this point might be better
understood. First, concerning such as contract matrimony, they teach on our part
that it is lawful for all men who are not fitted for single life
to contract matrimony, because vows cannot annul the ordinance and
commandment of God. But the commandment of God is 1 Cor. 7, 2: To avoid
fornication, let every man have his own wife. Nor is it the commandment
only, but also the creation and ordinance of God, which forces those to

his misfortunes, which were deeply engraven on my heart, struck me when
I wrote Emilius, and uniting M. Gatier with M. Gaime, I formed from
these two worthy priests the character of the Savoyard Vicar, and
flatter myself the imitation has not dishonored the originals. While I was at the seminary, M. d’Aubonne was obliged to quit Annecy,
Moultou being displeased that he made love to his wife, which was
acting like a dog in the manger, for though Madam Moultou was extremely
amiable, he lived very ill with her, treating her with such brutality
that a separation was talked of. Moultou, by repeated oppressions, at
length procured a dismissal from his employment: he was a disagreeable
man; a mole could not be blacker, nor an owl more knavish. It is

_Galata_ was formerly a Part of the City. The Thirteenth _Ward_ of _New
Rome_, says the Author, is the _Sycene Ward_, which is divided from it
by a narrow Bay, and preserves an Intercourse with it, by Boats and
Shipping. It is seated on the Side of a Hill, except a broad Tract
of Land at the Foot of it, which lies upon the Level. _Stephanus_
says, that the Town of _Sycæ_ was situated against _New Rome_, and
that it was call’d in his Time _Sycæ Justinianæ_, but does not give
the Reason why it was call’d so. Probably it was, because _Justinian_
either repair’d or rebuilt it; for which Reasons principally Cities
frequently change their Names.",53083,1400s
"There were twelve large cities or boroughs
(taking London as a double borough) returning 24 members, with 192,000
voters, and a population of 3,268,218, and 388,000 inhabited houses. On the other side, 24 members were returned by Andover, Buckingham,
Chippenham, Cockermouth, Totnes, Harwich, Bedford, Lymington,
Marlborough, Great Marlborough, and Richmond; but they had only 3,569
voters, 67,434 inhabitants, and 1,373 inhabited houses. * * The most
timid reformer and most moderate man would hardly object to the
disfranchisement of those boroughs which had a population less than
5000, and to handing over the 20 members to those large
constituencies."" As the people of Ireland are driven from the land to London,
Liverpool, or America, the claims of that country to representation
necessarily diminish; and so with Scotland, as the Highlands and the
Isles undergo the process of wholesale clearance. The same system that
depopulates them tends to depopulate the agricultural counties of
England, and to drive their people to seek employment in the great
cities and manufacturing towns; and this, according to Mr.
McCullogh,[161] is one of the principal advantages resulting from
absenteeism.",8000,1700s
"The lesser Hills which stand upon it, extend its Length, two of which
hang over the Bay. Its Height varies according to the different Height
of the three Clifts, or small Hills which rise upon it. For the Clift
lying to the South-east, rises moderately, from the lowest part of the
Valley to the Top of the Hill, to the Height of about a thousand Paces;
afterwards, as the Valley widens, it grows less, and is rendered more
steep by two small Valleys (branching out of the great Valley) which
indeed are somewhat upon the Descent, but not above a hundred Paces
high. The different Heights of the Clifts which hang over the Bay, may
be best discover’d by considering the different Heights of the five
_publick Ways_, which reach from the Ridge to the Foot of the Hill. The first of these Ways rises to the Height of five hundred Paces, two
hundred of which from the Foot of the Hill are very easy of Ascent, the
other three hundred are very steep.",53083,1400s

"Since barbarism drove them out of Greece and Rome, they seem to have

such people please and engage you, more than such and such others, of
equal merit; and you will always find that it is because the former have
the Graces and the latter not. I have known many a woman with an exact
shape, and a symmetrical assemblage of beautiful features, please nobody;
while others, with very moderate shapes and features, have charmed
everybody. Why? because Venus will not charm so much, without her
attendant Graces, as they will without her.",3352,1600s

little trees. They lay against the bottom, transparent; they darted
away from the jar of our horses' hoofs; they swam slowly against the
current, delicate as liquid shadows, as though the clear uniform golden
color of the bottom had clouded slightly to produce these tenuous
ghostly forms. We examined them curiously from the advantage our
slightly elevated trail gave us, and knew them for the Golden Trout,

arrival of the emigrants, a number of wagons had been sent down to take
them to their destinations, Captain Maxwell soon fell in with some of
the Dutch boors of the interior with whom he had been acquainted, and
who had come down with their wagons; but previous to making any
bargains, Alexander went with Captain Maxwell to the landroost, for whom
he had brought a letter from the governor. This gentleman immediately joined the party, and through his
intervention, before night, four excellent wagons with their tilts and
canvas coverings, and four span of oxen of fourteen each, were bought
and promised to be brought down and delivered up in good order, as soon
as they had carried up the freights with which they were charged. As these wagons could not return under four days, the next object that
they had in view was to procure some more horses, and here they met with
difficulty; for Major Henderson, who, as an excellent judge of horses,
was requested to select them, would not accept of many that were
offered. Still they had plenty of time, as the wagons would require
fitting out previous to their departure, and this would be a work of
some days; and many articles which they had decided to procure at Algoa
Bay, instead of the Cape, were now to be sought for and selected. At the time appointed, the wagons and teams were delivered over and paid

"By this increase, the place
became so filled with dwellings, that it might with propriety be
enumerated among the cities of Italy. There are various opinions concerning the derivation of the word
Florentia. Some suppose it to come from Florinus, one of the principal
persons of the colony; others think it was originally not Florentia, but
Fluentia, and suppose the word derived from _fluente_, or flowing of the
Arno; and in support of their opinion, adduce a passage from Pliny, who
says, ""the Fluentini are near the flowing of the Arno."" This, however,
may be incorrect, for Pliny speaks of the locality of the Florentini,
not of the name by which they were known. And it seems as if the word
Fluentini were a corruption, because Frontinus and Cornelius Tacitus,
who wrote at nearly the same period as Pliny, call them Florentia and
Florentini; for, in the time of Tiberius, they were governed like
the other cities of Italy.",2464,1400s

          He heard the noise of a nameless sea
          On an undiscovered isle. Lifting the great green ivy
          And the great spear lowering,
          One said, ""I am Alfred of Wessex,
          And I am a conquered king."" And the man of the cave made answer,
          And his eyes were stars of scorn,
          ""And better kings were conquered
          Or ever your sires were born. ""What goddess was your mother,
          What fay your breed begot,
          That you should not die with Uther
          And Arthur and Lancelot? ""But when you win you brag and blow,
          And when you lose you rail,
          Army of eastland yokels
          Not strong enough to fail.""",1719,1800s
"_Kent._ Fair blows the wind for France: blow, gentle gale,
   Till Edmund be arriv'd for England's good! Nature, yield to my country's cause in this! A brother? no, a butcher of thy friends! Proud Edward, dost thou banish me thy presence?",20288,1500s
"They were going to watch the pond that night; they were
going to watch Cayley under the moonlight, watch him as he threw into
the silence of the pond—what? The revolver? Well, anyhow, they were
going to watch him. What fun! To Antony, who was older and who realized into what deep waters they
were getting, it did not seem fun.",1872,1800s
"Do I travel alone, or am I one of a great company, swift yet
unhurried in their passage? The voices of Penelope’s suitors shrilled on
the ears of Ulysses, as they journeyed to the nether-world, like
nocturnal birds and bats in the inarticulateness of their speech. They
had abused the gift, and fled self-condemned. Maybe silence commends
itself as most suitable for the wayfarers towards the sunrise—silence
because they seek the Word—but for those hastening towards the confusion
they have wrought there falls already the sharp oncoming of the curse. While we are still here the language of worship seems far, and yet lies
very nigh; for what better note can our frail tongues lisp than the voice
of wind and sea, river and stream, those grateful servants giving all and
asking nothing, the soft whisper of snow and rain eager to replenish, or
the thunder proclaiming a majesty too great for utterance?",705,1800s
"""I could easily....""

Onin grinned at Jay sardonically and winked. Jay shifted uncomfortably. Her hand dropped and she pushed at his naked chest. ""Back to the ship!"" Her voice snapped crisply as she led the way.",64595,1900s

"Dr.
Sands answered, ""I give God thanks, who hath moved your heart to mind me
so well, that I think myself most bound unto you. God shall requite you,
nor shall I ever be found unthankful. But as you have dealt friendly

"The second is that, while they may understand sexual
desire objectively, they can never experience it themselves. ""Those characteristics fit your man Quest to a T, Trella. There is no
other explanation for him: he must be an android."" *       *       *       *       *

Trella did not want to believe Jakdane was right, but his reasoning
was unassailable. Looking upon Quest as an android, many things were
explained: his great strength, his short, broad build, his immunity to
injury, his refusal to defend himself against a human, his inability
to return Trella's love for him.",27588,1900s
"Poor soul, God’s goodness hath been great to thee. Let never day nor night unhallowed pass,
But still remember what the Lord hath done. QUEEN MARGARET. Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance,

You would abate the strength of your displeasure? Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,
Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,

"A stranger fish myself, not yet expired,
   Tho’, rapt with Beauty’s hook, I did impart
      Myself unto th’ anatomy desired,
   Instead of gall, leaving to her my heart:
      Yet live with thoughts closed up, ’till that she will,

   Large rooms within where drops distil amain:

      Of truth, far more than alabaster pure,
      Which, though despised, yet still doth truth endure. V.

"“I can’t like
everybody.”

“Quite true, Arthur. Jasper is not a special friend of mine, and I am
not particular about your liking him. I hope you like me.”

“You know I do, Rodney,” and he gave Rodney’s hand an assuring pressure. Ten minutes after he left Rodney, Jasper fell in with Carton. The
intimacy between them had perceptibly fallen off.",399,1800s
"And already the more northern tribes are beginning to
be harried by gigantic blond savages, not much more advanced than
ape-men. The tale of the next thousand years is the tale of the rise of the
Hyborians, whose warlike tribes dominate the western world. Rude
kingdoms are taking shape. The tawny-haired invaders have encountered
the Picts, driving them into the barren lands of the west. To the
northwest, the descendants of the Atlanteans, climbing unaided from
apedom into primitive savagery, have not yet met the conquerors.",42182,1900s
"That of
Protection is the prime, for which they were originally form’d together
with the Leaves themselves, and whose service they enjoy in their
Infant-estate: For the _Hairs_ being then in form of a _Down_, alwayes
very thick set, thus give that protection to the Leaves, which their
exceeding tenderness then requires; so that they seem to be vested with a
Coat of _Frieze_, or to be kept warm, like young and dainty Chickens, in
Wooll. _Globulets_ are seen upon _Orach_, both Garden and wild; and yet more
plainly on _Mercury_ or _Bonus Henricus_. In these, growing almost upon
the whole Plant, and being very large, they are by all taken notice of. But strict Observation discovers, that these _Globulets_ are the
natural and constant Off-spring of very many other Plants. Both these
_Globulets_, and likewise the diversity of _Hairs_, I find the Learned
Mr. _Hook_ hath already observed.",58138,1600s

"And
here we speak of special faith which believes the present promise,
not only that which in general believes that God exists, but which
believes that the remission of sins is offered. This use of the
Sacrament consoles godly and alarmed minds. Moreover, no one can express in words what abuses in the Church this
fanatical opinion concerning the opus operate, without a good
disposition on the part of the one using the Sacraments, has produced. Hence the infinite profanation of the Masses, but of this we shall
speak below. Neither can a single letter be produced from the old
writers which in this matter favors the scholastics.",6744,1400s
"In these Provinces, there was a City seated on the Bay of _Codera_,
whose Lord was call'd _Higueroto_, a Name, either proper to Persons or
common to the Rulers of that Place. A _Cacic_ of such signal Clemency,
and his Subjects of such noted Vertue, that the _Spaniards_ who came
thither, were extraordinarily welcom, furnished with Provisions,
enjoying Peace and Comfort, and no Refreshment wanting: But a
perfidious Wretch got many of them on board, and sold them to the
Islanders of St. _John_. At the same time I landed upon that Island,
where I obtained a sight of this Tyrant, and heard the Relation of his
Actions. He utterly destroy'd that Land, which the rest of the
_Spaniards_ took very unkindly at his Hands, who frequently playd the
Pirate, and rob'd on that shore, detesting it as a wicked thing,
because they had lost that place, where they use to be treated with as
great Hospitality and Freedom, as if they had been under their own
Roof: Nay they transported from this place, among them, to the Isles of
_Hispaniola_ and St. _John_ Two Millions of Men and upward, and made
the Coast a Desert. It is most certainly true, that they never ship off a Vessel freighted
with _Indians_, but they pay a third part as Tribute to the Sea,
besides those who are slaughter'd, when found in their own Houses.",20321,1400s
"Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,
    To sing heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue. VI


Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,
When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,
A longing tarriance for Adonis made
Under an osier growing by a brook,
A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen. Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
For his approach, that often there had been. Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,
And stood stark naked on the brook’s green brim:
The sun look’d on the world with glorious eye,
Yet not so wistly as this queen on him. He, spying her, bounc’d in, whereas he stood,
    “O Jove,” quoth she, “why was not I a flood?”




VII


Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle,
Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty,
Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle,
Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:
    A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,
    None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.",1544,1500s
"though well he knew it was my lord: who would not answer but
would leave the honour to that other: yet when the sentinel grew more
impatient and repeated his challenge, the Commissary answered to the
last ""Who goes there?"" ""The man who pays the money."" Now as we passed the sentry-box, and I came last of all, I heard the
before-mentioned sentry, which was a new recruit, and before that by
profession a well-to-do young farmer on the Vogelsberg, thus murmur to
himself: ""Yea, and a lying customer thou art: a man, forsooth, that
pays the money? a skin-the-flint that takes the money, that art thou. So much money hast thou wrung from me that I would to God thou wert
struck dead before thou shouldst leave this town.""",33858,1600s
"Shall we have music and the jocund dance,
Or tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam
These hills about the river, flowering now
To April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,
Or play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,
I ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er
And riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,
Shall we submit to have these youths and maids
Branded as libertines and wantons?”

Ere
His words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”
Then rose a sound of moving chairs, as when
The numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;
And every head was turned, as when a flock
Of geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread
Rise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall
With riotous laughter, for with battered hat
Tilted upon her saucy head, and fist
Raised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood. Headlong she had been hurled from out the hall
Save Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,
Prevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard. Then, mid applause she hastened toward the stage
And flung both gold and silver to the cause
And swiftly left the hall.",1280,1800s
"Dicky and
Oswald walked round the garden and told each other what they thought of
the new society. ‘I’m not sure we oughtn’t to have put our foot down at the beginning,’
Dicky said. ‘I don’t see much in it, anyhow.’

‘It pleases the girls,’ Oswald said, for he is a kind brother. ‘But we’re not going to stand jaw, and “words in season”, and “loving
sisterly warnings”. I tell you what it is, Oswald, we’ll have to run
this thing our way, or it’ll be jolly beastly for everybody.’

Oswald saw this plainly.",794,1800s
"6  Then said all the Jews, Let
us send to those three men, who
said they saw him talking with
his disciples in mount Olivet. 7  After this, they asked them
what they had seen; who answered
with one accord, In the presence
of the God of Israel we affirm,
that we plainly saw Jesus talking
with his disciples in Mount Olivet,
and ascending up to heaven. 8  Then Annas and Caiaphas took
them into separate places, and
examined them separately; who
unanimously confessed the truth,
and said, they had seen Jesus. 9  Then Annas and Caiaphas said
""Our law saith, By the mouth of
two or three witnesses every word
shall be established."" 10  But what have we said?",6510,1600s
"Just what they could have done in Firth's world with
shorter hours, no one knows. They staged a spotty, amateurish strike;
speakers made reference to the labor laws applicable on the Earth and
demanded better pay. To what end, it's hard for us to say. If the first
colonists had turned over all their wealth, the workers would have had
no more use for it. John Firth was unusually alarmed by the threatened strike.",59252,1900s
"They retired quietly to rest, not aware that the precipice,
detached from the bank, and urged by an accumulation of water in the
crevice behind, was tottering to its base. It fell during the night, and
the whole party was buried under its ruins. The length of our voyage to-day was, in a direct line, sixteen miles and
a quarter, on a S.S.W. course. We encamped soon after sunset, and the
tent was scarcely pitched when a heavy rain began, which continued all
night.",18979,1700s
"""Did you ever see Frederick Stephenson with my brother?"" said her
ladyship; ""they were at Clifton together this summer.... Perhaps you
don't know that I was married there, Agnes?... and Sir Edward and I left
our two brothers there together."" This change of subject was a considerable relief; and Agnes answered
with tolerable composure,--""Oh yes!... I did know you were married
there, for I heard it mentioned several times; ... and I saw you too,
Lady Stephenson, the evening before you were married, walking up and
down Gloucester Row with ... with your brother.""",36562,1700s

"In 1325, Castruccio, having taken possession of Pistoia, became so
powerful that the Florentines, fearing his greatness, resolved, before
he should get himself firmly seated in his new conquest, to attack him
and withdraw it from his authority. Of their citizens and friends they
mustered an army amounting to 20,000 foot and 3,000 horse, and with this
body encamped before Altopascio, with the intention of taking the place
and thus preventing it from relieving Pistoia. Being successful in the
first part of their design, they marched toward Lucca, and laid the
country waste in their progress; but from the little prudence and less
integrity of their leader, Ramondo di Cardona, they made but small
progress; for he, having observed them upon former occasions very
prodigal of their liberty, placing it sometimes in the hands of a king,
at others in those of a legate, or persons of even inferior quality,
thought, if he could bring them into some difficulty, it might easily
happen that they would make him their prince. Nor did he fail frequently
to mention these matters, and required to have that authority in the
city which had been given him over the army, endeavoring to show that
otherwise he could not enforce the obedience requisite to a leader. As
the Florentines did not consent to this, he wasted time, and allowed
Castruccio to obtain the assistance which the Visconti and other tyrants
of Lombardy had promised him, and thus become very strong.",2464,1400s

"Doyle had taken a position on the
north side of the ferry, and when M'Cottry, in advance, with his mounted
riflemen, arrived at the creek, the British were scuttling a ferry boat
on the opposite side. He took a position behind trees, and gave them
a well directed and deadly fire; they ran to their arms and returned a
prodigious volley, which did no more harm than that of knocking off
the limbs of trees among the riflemen. Doyle had received news, which
occasioned him to retreat for Camden. The ferry boat being now scuttled
and sunk on the opposite side, and Lynch's creek being swollen, and at
this place wide and deep, Gen. Marion proceeded up the creek, and swam
over it at the first place he reached, five miles above Witherspoon's. This was the shortest route to come at Doyle.",923,1700s

"He and another lived alone in a little
hermitage, where they saw nobody but such as came to visit their
chapel. He had lived twelve years in this hut, never eating anything
but pulse with salt, and sometimes oil. Three times a week he lived on
bread and water. He never drank wine, and generally took but one meal
in twenty-four hours. He wore for a shirt a coarse hair cloth, and
lodged on the bare ground.",22269,1600s

Sadly, in accents forlorn, the writer said:

""Bug-eyed monsters! Ye gads! Bug-eyed monsters! Jack, old boy, do you
realize we're setting science-fiction back a hundred years?""",32726,1900s
"We can SEE an angle, because we, in the region of
Space, can see two straight lines inclined to one another; but you, who
can see nothing but one straight line at a time, or at all events only
a number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line--how can
you ever discern any angle, and much less register angles of different
sizes?"" I answer that though we cannot SEE angles, we can INFER them, and this
with great precision. Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity, and
developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far more
accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or measure
of angles. Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural
helps. It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles
class shall begin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and shall
increase (if it increases at all) by half a degree in every generation;
until the goal of 60 degrees is reached, when the condition of serfdom
is quitted, and the freeman enters the class of Regulars.",201,1800s
"Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would
serve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised
nations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or
nearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended. And
thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or
ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers. I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils
after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. The proposition, and
demonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed
of a cephalic tincture. This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting
stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.",829,1600s

through March (45.1 per cent), April (38.5 per cent), May (23.9 per
cent), June (18.7 per cent) and July (16.2 per cent) (Fig. 4). These
percentages suggest that the habitat conditions in October and November
were probably important in determining the population level for at least
the first half of the next year. [Illustration: FIG. 4.",39396,1900s

had left him satisfied for the moment. He turned onto a wider street,
heading the long distance across the city toward the most probable

official line was disapproving of such a union. But he was sure there
would be one.",24196,1900s

"Heyward was fain to wait
until the verse was ended; when, seeing David relieving himself from the
spectacles, and replacing the book, he continued. “It will be your duty to see that none dare to approach the ladies with
any rude intention, or to offer insult or taunt at the misfortune of their
brave father. In this task you will be seconded by the domestics of their
household.”

“Even so.”

“It is possible that the Indians and stragglers of the enemy may intrude,
in which case you will remind them of the terms of the capitulation, and
threaten to report their conduct to Montcalm. A word will suffice.”

“If not, I have that here which shall,” returned David, exhibiting
his book, with an air in which meekness and confidence were singularly blended. Here are words which, uttered, or rather thundered, with proper emphasis, and
in measured time, shall quiet the most unruly temper:

“‘Why rage the heathen furiously’?”

“Enough,” said Heyward, interrupting the burst of his musical
invocation; “we understand each other; it is time that we should now
assume our respective duties.”

Gamut cheerfully assented, and together they sought the females.",940,1700s

"The young duchess, though an English princess, had at heart the
interests of the country in which she had been reared, and which on her
marriage she had adopted as her own. She therefore gladly undertook this
mission, confident of her success from the fact that of all his family
she had ever been the most tenderly beloved by Charles. Therefore she
set out from France, and in the month of May, 1670, arrived at Dover,
to which port the king, Queen, and court hastened, that they might greet
and entertain her. For full ten days in this merry month, high revelry
was held at Dover, during which time Henrietta skilfully and secretly
effected the object of her visit. And her delight was now the greater,
inasmuch as one item which this agreement entrusted her to make, engaged
that Charles would, as soon as he could with safety, follow the example
of his brother the Duke of York, and become a Catholic.",1879,1800s

"They perceived that such a sight
could not but signify something heavenly; they knew that what is
flaming signifies celestial love and its affections; that a hand, to
which the flaming object adhered, signifies life and its power; that
changes of the colours signify the varieties of life as to wisdom
and intelligence; that a bird has the same signification with this
difference, however, that what is flaming signifies celestial love
and the things that belong to celestial love, while a bird signifies
spiritual love and the things that belong to that love; (celestial
love is love to the Lord, and spiritual love is charity towards the
neighbour,[note gg]); and that the changes of the colours and at the
same time of the life in the bird, till it became stony, signify the
successive changes of spiritual life as to intelligence. They also
knew that the spirits who ascend from below, through the region of the
loins to that of the breast, are in a strong persuasion that they
are in the Lord, and consequently believe that whatever they do, even
though it be evil, they do of the Lord's will. But nevertheless this
did not enable them to know who were meant by that sight. At length
they were instructed from heaven, that the inhabitants of Mars were
meant; that their celestial love, in which many of them still are, was
signified by the flaming object that adhered to the hand; and that the
bird in the beginning, while it was in the beauty of its colours and
the vigour of its life, signified their spiritual love: but that the
bird when it had become as it were stony and devoid of life, and at
length of a dusky colour, signified those inhabitants who have removed
themselves from the good of love, and are in evil, and still believe,
nevertheless, that they are in the Lord. The same thing was signified
by the spirit who rose up and wished to take away the bird.",16044,1600s

"The buried treasure was all gold and gems. Now that
it was there it seemed to grow and grow before him; it would have been,
through all time and taking all tongues, one of the most wonderful
flowers of literary art. Nothing, in especial, once you were face to
face with it, could show for more consummately _done_. When once it came
out it came out, was there with a splendour that made you ashamed; and
there hadn’t been, save in the bottomless vulgarity of the age, with
every one tasteless and tainted, every sense stopped, the smallest reason
why it should have been overlooked. It was great, yet so simple, was
simple, yet so great, and the final knowledge of it was an experience
quite apart.",645,1800s
"Sound and deep, beyond natural rest, was the sleep of Hamish MacTavish
on that eventful evening, but not such the repose of his mother. Scarce
did she close her eyes from time to time, but she awakened again with
a start, in the terror that her son had arisen and departed; and it was
only on approaching his couch, and hearing his deep-drawn and regular
breathing, that she reassured herself of the security of the repose in
which he was plunged. Still, dawning, she feared, might awaken him, notwithstanding the
unusual strength of the potion with which she had drugged his cup. If
there remained a hope of mortal man accomplishing the journey, she was
aware that Hamish would attempt it, though he were to die from fatigue
upon the road. Animated by this new fear, she studied to exclude the
light, by stopping all the crannies and crevices through which, rather
than through any regular entrance, the morning beams might find access
to her miserable dwelling; and this in order to detain amid its wants
and wretchedness the being on whom, if the world itself had been at her
disposal, she would have joyfully conferred it.",1828,1700s

"To those,
therefore, who want to be justified by their vows Christ is made of
no effect, and they fall from grace. For also these who ascribe
justification to vows ascribe to their own works that which properly
belongs to the glory of Christ. Nor can it be denied, indeed, that the monks have taught that, by their
vows and observances, they were justified, and merited forgiveness of
sins, yea, they invented still greater absurdities, saying that they
could give others a share in their works. If any one should be inclined
to enlarge on these things with evil intent, how many things could he
bring together whereof even the monks are now ashamed! Over and above
this, they persuaded men that services of man's making were a state of
Christian perfection.",275,1400s
"The contrition of Judas or Saul is of no avail, for the
reason that to this there is not added this faith which apprehends
the remission of sins, bestowed as a gift for Christ's sake. Accordingly, the contrition of David or Peter avails because to it
there is added faith, which apprehends the remission of sins granted
for Christ's sake. Neither is love present before reconciliation has
been made by faith. For without Christ the Law [God's Law or the
First Commandment] is not performed, according to [Eph. 2, 18; 3,12]

"But we did
not stay there long. The Squire was going to be married, and, as I
was his best wig, I, of course, adorned his head at the wedding. Who would have believed that I was the same hair that covered the
head of dear Alice when she was a bride? Then curling like
hyacinths, and glowing like sunshine, now stiff, dull and dead;
looking, as I thought then, and think now, like nothing human or
divine. It was the second time the Squire had been married, so he was very
sedate in his happiness.",4048,1700s

He stopped stock-still and scowled and the beautiful Monarch butterfly
swung proudly away in the air, starting to stop every now and then and
not doing it, but lifting itself on the breeze and floating away to
another place. It wouldn’t be long until fall now, I thought, when all the Monarchs
in the Sugar Creek territory would gather themselves into flocks like
blackbirds and crows do, and before winter they would migrate to the
South, flying all the way down to the bottom of the United States and
even into Mexico or South America. Then next spring they would be back
at Sugar Creek to lay their eggs on the milkweeds which grow in the
fence rows or wherever a farmer doesn’t cut them down. The larva that hatches from the milkweed or Monarch butterflies is
one of the prettiest a boy ever sees, being a long greenish-yellow
caterpillar with crow-black rings around it all along its body from
its head to its tail--only it is hard to tell which end is its head on
account of it has two short black horns on each end of itself. You can see a greenish-yellow-and-black Monarch larva hanging from a
milkweed leaf most any time in the late summer, if you stop and look
close enough.",58628,1900s

           Terror flared across the Saturnian moons. One of
           the Woollies, that perfect slave-race, had killed
               a _man_! But to Big Bill, shambling away
             from his bloody, suddenly silent master, the
              ancient pattern of obedience was unchanged. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

"I’ll go and see my
solicitor and get him to write to Miller. We can make him pay up
something, I’m sure. If we can get a hundred pounds out of him it’ll
carry you on till after the baby comes.”

“I wouldn’t take a penny from him. I’d rather starve.”

“But it’s monstrous that he should leave you in the lurch like this.”

“I’ve got my pride to consider.”

It was a little awkward for Philip. He needed rigid economy to make his
own money last till he was qualified, and he must have something over
to keep him during the year he intended to spend as house physician and
house surgeon either at his own or at some other hospital.",351,1800s
"Fritz von Tarlenheim buried his face in his hands. The King breathed
loudly and heavily. Sapt stirred him again with his foot. “The drunken dog!” he said; “but he’s an Elphberg and the son of his
father, and may I rot in hell before Black Michael sits in his place!”

For a moment or two we were all silent; then Sapt, knitting his bushy
grey brows, took his pipe from his mouth and said to me:

“As a man grows old he believes in Fate. Fate sent you here.",95,1800s

consulted either the Reverend Publisher's Epistle to the Reader, or

(in edition of Paris, 1821)]. Most excellent potent brilliant eyes,
swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun; gray, we said, of the
azure-gray color; large enough, not of glaring size; the habitual
expression of them vigilance and penetrating sense, rapidity resting on
depth. Which is an excellent combination; and gives us the notion of a
lambent outer radiance springing from some great inner sea of light and
fire in the man. The voice, if he speak to you, is of similar
physiognomy: clear, melodious and sonorous; all tones are in it, from
that of ingenuous inquiry, graceful sociality, light-flowing banter
(rather prickly for most part), up to definite word of command, up to
desolating word of rebuke and reprobation; a voice ""the clearest and
most agreeable in conversation I ever heard,"" says witty Dr. Moore. [Moore, View of Society and Manners in France, Switzerland and Germany

   I’ve an entertaining snigger, I’ve a fascinating leer;
   To everybody’s prejudice I know a thing or two;
   I can tell a woman’s age in half a minute—and I do—

   Yet everybody says I’m such a disagreeable man! And I can’t think why! THE COMING BY-AND-BY


   SAD is that woman’s lot who, year by year,
   Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear;
   As Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
   Impatiently begins to “dim her eyes”!—
   Herself compelled, in life’s uncertain gloamings,
   To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved “combings”—
   Reduced, with rouge, lipsalve, and pearly grey,
   To “make up” for lost time, as best she may! Silvered is the raven hair,
         Spreading is the parting straight,
      Mottled the complexion fair,

"Having thus cleared myself from the suspicion of any sinister view, I
cannot here refrain from presenting you with a peace-offering. Had it
been in my power to procure gums more costly, or incense more fragrant,
I would have rendered it more worthy your acceptance. It has been a subject upon which I have often reflected with
mortification, that the world is too apt to lay aside your lucubrations
with the occasions that gave birth to them, and that if they are ever
opened after, it is only with old magazines by staid matrons over their
winter fire. Such persons are totally incapable of comparing your
sentences with the maturer verdict of the public; a comparison that
would redound so much to your honour. What I design at present, is in
some measure to remedy an evil, that can never perhaps be entirely
removed.",10597,1700s
"Then harder pressed still, sick with the force of his shock, and falling
back as under the hot breath and the roused passion of a life larger than
his own, a rage of personality before which his own collapsed, he felt
the whole vision turn to darkness and his very feet give way. His head
went round; he was going; he had gone. CHAPTER III


What had next brought him back, clearly--though after how long?--was Mrs.
Muldoon's voice, coming to him from quite near, from so near that he
seemed presently to see her as kneeling on the ground before him while he
lay looking up at her; himself not wholly on the ground, but half-raised
and upheld--conscious, yes, of tenderness of support and, more
particularly, of a head pillowed in extraordinary softness and faintly
refreshing fragrance. He considered, he wondered, his wit but half at
his service; then another face intervened, bending more directly over
him, and he finally knew that Alice Staverton had made her lap an ample
and perfect cushion to him, and that she had to this end seated herself
on the lowest degree of the staircase, the rest of his long person
remaining stretched on his old black-and-white slabs. They were cold,
these marble squares of his youth; but _he_ somehow was not, in this rich
return of consciousness--the most wonderful hour, little by little, that
he had ever known, leaving him, as it did, so gratefully, so abysmally
passive, and yet as with a treasure of intelligence waiting all round him
for quiet appropriation; dissolved, he might call it, in the air of the
place and producing the golden glow of a late autumn afternoon.",1190,1800s

"_To butter Eggs upon toasts._

Take twenty eggs, beat them in a dish with some salt and put butter
to them; then have two large rouls or fine manchets, cut them into
toasts, & toast them against the fire with a pound of fine sweet
butter; being finely buttered, lay the toasts in a fair clean
scowred dish, put the eggs on the toasts, and garnish the dish with
pepper and salt. Otherways, half boil them in the shells, then
butter them, and serve them on toasts, or toasts about them. To these eggs sometimes use musk and ambergriece, and no pepper. _Otherways._

Take twenty eggs, and strain them whites and all with a little salt;
then have a skillet with a pound of clarified butter, warm on the
fire, then fry a good thick toast of fine manchet as round as the
skillet, and an inch thick, the toast being finely fryed, put the
eggs on it into the skillet, to fry on the manchet, but not too
hard; being finely fried put it on a trencher-plate with the eggs
uppermost, and salt about the dish. _An excellent way to butter Eggs._

Take twenty yolks of new laid or fresh eggs, put them into a dish
with as many spoonfuls of jelly, or mutton gravy without fat, put to
it a quarter of a pound of sugar, 2 ounces of preserved lemon-peel
either grated or cut into thin slices or very little bits, with some
salt, and four spoonfuls of rose-water, stir them together on the
coals, and being butter'd dish them, put some musk on them with some
fine sugar; you may as well eat these eggs cold as hot, with a
little cinamon-water, or without.",22790,1500s

Saxony, for which the Administrator of Magdeburg, Christian William of
Brandenburg, was otherwise to be indemnified. The Dukes of Mecklenburg,
upon acceding to this treaty, were to be acknowledged as rightful
possessors of their territories, in which the magnanimity of Gustavus
Adolphus had long ago reinstated them. Donauwerth recovered its
liberties. The important claims of the heirs of the Palatine, however
important it might be for the Protestant cause not to lose this
electorate vote in the diet, were passed over in consequence of the
animosity subsisting between the Lutherans and the Calvinists. All the
conquests which, in the course of the war, had been made by the German
states, or by the League and the Emperor, were to be mutually restored;
all which had been appropriated by the foreign powers of France and
Sweden, was to be forcibly wrested from them by the united powers.",6774,1700s
"Moreover, I was informed,
they and their Lord had sent their beloved Wives and best Effects to
an Island, which is about thirty Miles to the Eastward of _Jaqueen_
on the Sea-Coast, and under the Protection of the King of _Appah_,
whose Country extends as far as the Bay of _Bennin_. And as they
durst not trust intirely to the Conqueror’s Faith and Promises, so
the Men were always ready to fly there themselves, on the least
appearance of Hostility: There they could be in safety, the _Dahomes_
not having Cannoes to follow them, or if they had, none amongst them
understanding the Management of them. A few days after the Lord of _Jaqueen_ had refused to take his usual
Customs, another difficulty arose; for the Porters refused to bring
up my Goods from the Sea side, except I would pay them double the
price I did at my first coming. Thereupon I sent my Complaint to
their Lord, who acknowledged it was a great Imposition, but he sent
me word, “It was not in his Power to oblige those sort of People to
do me Justice; for by the stranding of the _Dutch_ Ship, they had
got so many Goods, that it had made them rich and proud; and should
he go about to force them to bring up my Goods at the usual rates,
they would forthwith quit the Country, and fly to _Appah_.” Being in
these melancholy Circumstances, imposed on by all hands, and without
hopes of redress, an accident relieved me very unexpectedly. For a
few days after this, the Lord of the place sent for me; and going to
him, he told me, “He had just then received Advice, that an _English_
Ship was arrived in the Road of _Whidaw_; and he desired I would
send my Boat there, to persuade the Captain to come to _Jaqueen_.” I
answered, “I did not doubt but that Ship was the _Italian_ Galley,
Captain _Dagge_, who was known to him; for I had expected him some
time, his Ship belonging to the same Gentleman as mine did: But
since I had received such bad usage from him and his People, he could
not expect I would be so imprudent as to advise the Captain, who was
in the same Interest with me, to come and receive the like Treatment:
Adding, If I sent my Boat, it should be to desire Captain _Dagge_ to
stay at _Whidaw_, and send a Messenger to the King of _Dahomè_, to
represent the usage I had met with from him; tho’, to let him see how
loth I was to give any Offence that way, I should intirely forget
what was past, if he would make me easy.” This immediately brought
him to do me Justice: He took his usual Custom that very day, and
the following went himself to the Sea side, to the Towns where the
Porters lived, and persuaded them to carry my Goods at the usual
rates.",75052,1600s
"And if the other Electors, Princes, and Estates of the Empire will,
according to the said Imperial proposition, present similar writings,
to wit, in Latin and German, giving their opinions in this matter of
religion, we, with the Princes and friends aforesaid, here before Your
Imperial Majesty, our most clement Lord are prepared to confer amicably
concerning all possible ways and means, in order that we may come
together, as far as this may be honorably done, and, the matter between
us on both sides being peacefully discussed without offensive strife,
the dissension, by God's help, may be done away and brought back to
one true accordant religion; for as we all are under one Christ and do
battle under Him, we ought to confess the one Christ, after the tenor
of Your Imperial Majesty's edict, and everything ought to be conducted
according to the truth of God; and this it is what, with most fervent
prayers, we entreat of God. However, as regards the rest of the Electors, Princes, and Estates,
who constitute the other part, if no progress should be made, nor some
result be attained by this treatment of the cause of religion after the
manner in which Your Imperial Majesty has wisely held that it should be
dealt with and treated namely, by such mutual presentation of writings
and calm conferring together among ourselves, we at least leave with
you a clear testimony, that we here in no wise are holding back from
anything that could bring about Christian concord,--such as could be
effected with God and a good conscience,--as also Your Imperial Majesty
and, next, the other Electors and Estates of the Empire, and all who
are moved by sincere love and zeal for religion, and who will give an
impartial hearing to this matter, will graciously deign to take
notice and to understand this from this Confession of ours and of our
associates. Your Imperial Majesty also, not only once but often, graciously
signified to the Electors Princes, and Estates of the Empire, and at the
Diet of Spires held A. D. 1526, according to the form of Your Imperial
instruction and commission given and prescribed, caused it to be stated
and publicly proclaimed that Your Majesty, in dealing with this matter
of religion, for certain reasons which were alleged in Your Majesty's
name, was not willing to decide and could not determine anything, but
that Your Majesty would diligently use Your Majesty's office with the
Roman Pontiff for the convening of a General Council. The same matter
was thus publicly set forth at greater length a year ago at the last
Diet which met at Spires. There Your Imperial Majesty, through His
Highness Ferdinand, King of Bohemia and Hungary, our friend and clement
Lord, as well as through the Orator and Imperial Commissioners caused
this, among other things, to be submitted: that Your Imperial Majesty
had taken notice of; and pondered, the resolution of Your Majesty's
Representative in the Empire, and of the President and Imperial
Counselors, and the Legates from other Estates convened at Ratisbon,
concerning the calling of a Council, and that your Imperial Majesty also
judged it to be expedient to convene a Council; and that Your Imperial
Majesty did not doubt the Roman Pontiff could be induced to hold
a General Council, because the matters to be adjusted between Your
Imperial Majesty and the Roman Pontiff were nearing agreement and
Christian reconciliation; therefore Your Imperial Majesty himself
signified that he would endeavor to secure the said Chief Pontiff's
consent for convening, together with your Imperial Majesty such General
Council, to be published as soon as possible by letters that were to be
sent out.",275,1400s

"In three minutes after this answer had been received by the captain of
the Adamant, two shells went whirring and shrieking through the air
toward Repeller No. 7, and after that the cannonading from the bow, the
stern, the starboard, and the port guns of the great battle-ship went
on whenever there was a visible object on the ocean which looked in the
least like an American coasting vessel or man-of-war. For a week Crab K towed steadily to the south this blazing and
thundering marine citadel; and then the crab signalled to the still
accompanying repeller that it must be relieved. It had not been fitted
out for so long a cruise, and supplies were getting low. The Syndicate, which had been kept informed of all the details of this
affair, had already perceived the necessity of relieving Crab K, and
another crab, well provisioned and fitted out, was already on the way
to take its place.",427,1800s

laid on sad strokes, and smitten us, yet have we not turned to him. It may
be, when the chastisement was fresh and green, some poured out a prayer,
and in trouble visited God, (Isa. xxvi. 16,) but the body of the land hath
not known him that smote them, and never ran into their hiding place, but

impossible for a man to be more amorous than the Duke is of Craon (19th
of April, 1718). It cannot be denied that she (Madame de Craon) is full of agreeable
qualities. Although she is not a beauty, she has a good shape, a fine

"It were absurd, it is true, to name this in the simple
character of a _cause_, when we speak of the rousing of the popular mind
from a long stagnation; it being itself a proof and result of some
preceding cause beginning to pervade and disturb that stagnation. But
whatever may be assigned as the true and sufficient explanation of its
origin, we have to look on the mighty operation of its progress, forcing a
restlessness, instability, and tendency to change, into almost every part
of the social economy. In the whole compass of time there has been no
train of events, that has within so short a period stirred to the very
bottom the mind of so vast a portion of the race. And the power of this
great commotion has less consisted in what may be termed its physical
energy, evinced in grand exploits and catastrophes, than in its being an
intense activity of _principles_. It was as different from other
convulsions in the moral world, as would be a tempest attributed to the
direct intervention of a mighty spirit, whether believed celestial or
infernal, from one raised in the elements by mere natural causes.",8940,1700s

nature of worship? There are many, in all countries, who, in this
confused time, have no other method of worship. He who, in any way,

"I came the other night at twelve, the door was

a man, and saw him led to you into your chamber, sighing as he went,
and panting with impatience: now, _Sylvia_, if you value my repose, my
life, my reputation, or my services, turn it off handsomely, and I am
happy.’ At that, being wholly amazed, she told him the whole story, as
you heard of her dressing _Antonet_, and bringing him to her; at which
he smiled, and begged her to go on----She fetched the pieces of
_Brilliard_’. counterfeit letters, and shewed him; this brought him a
little to his wits, and at first sight he was ready to fancy the
letters came indeed from him; he found the character his, but not his
business; and in great amaze replied, ‘Ah, madam, did you know
_Octavio_’. soul so well, and could you imagine it capable of a
thought like this? A presumption so daring to the most awful of her
sex; this was unkind indeed: and did you answer them?’ ‘Yes,’ replied
she, ‘with all the kindness I could force my pen to express.’ So that
after canvassing the matter, and relating the whole story again with
his being taken ill, they concluded from every circumstance
_Brilliard_ was the man; for _Antonet_ was called to council; who now
recollecting all things in her mind, and knowing _Brilliard_ but too
well, she confessed she verily believed it was he, especially when she
told how she stole a letter of _Octavio_’. for him that day, and how
he was ill of the same disease still.",8409,1600s

George Sand, so great a novelist, gave the world few characters who live

that real woman, Emma Bovary. _Her_ we know, her we remember, as we

"An inherited habit of muscular
exertion will thus have been gained in association with rage; and this
will directly or indirectly affect various organs, in nearly the same
manner as does great bodily suffering. The heart no doubt will likewise be affected in a direct manner; but it
will also in all probability be affected through habit; and all the
more so from not being under the control of the will. We know that any
great exertion which we voluntarily make, affects the heart, through
mechanical and other principles which need not here be considered; and
it was shown in the first chapter that nerve-force flows readily
through habitually used channels,—through the nerves of voluntary or
involuntary movement, and through those of sensation. Thus even a
moderate amount of exertion will tend to act on the heart; and on the
principle of association, of which so many instances have been given,
we may feel nearly sure that any sensation or emotion, as great pain or
rage, which has habitually led to much muscular action, will
immediately influence the flow of nerve-force to the heart, although
there may not be at the time any muscular exertion. The heart, as I have said, will be all the more readily affected
through habitual associations, as it is not under the control of the
will.",1227,1800s

himself in conversation. He brings into the talk other thoughts than
those which he expresses; you are conscious that he keeps an eye on
something else, that he does not shake off the world, nor quite forget

unfairness for his companions, who find themselves one day giving too
much, and the next, when they are wary out of season, giving perhaps too

"Any criticism of Lovecraft’s work, no matter how brief, would be
incomplete if it omitted mention of his famous essay, “Supernatural
Horror in Literature.” Even Edmund Wilson concedes that the essay
is “a really able piece of work.” In my pamphlet, “H. P. Lovecraft:
A Bibliography”, I commented: “The background and evolution of the
horror tale—a “must” for anyone seriously interested in the genre.” The
comment still holds. Apart from the letters, I think it is probably the
finest piece of non-fiction which Lovecraft ever wrote. Judging from the few letters and extracts from letters which are in
print, Lovecraft’s “Selected Letters” (or “Collected”) will definitely
enhance his reputation. It is probable that their publication will
revive and intensify interest in both the man and his work.",72004,1900s

Crabs, or a losing game--that is, aces, or ace and deuce, twelve, or
seven. Hence, the caster always called for his main; consequently, as he
could neither throw one nor seven, let his chance be what it might,
he was sure to win, and he and those who were in the secret of course
always took the odds. The false dice being concealed in the left hand,
the caster took the box with the fair dice in it in his right hand,
and in the act of shaking it caught the fair dice in his hand, and
unperceived shifted the box empty to his left, from which he dropped
the false dice into the box, which he began to rattle, called his main

"But it is manifest that, by such belief, traditions have almost
infinitely multiplied in the Church, the doctrine concerning faith and
the righteousness of faith being meanwhile suppressed. For gradually
more holy-days were made, fasts appointed, new ceremonies and services
in honor of saints instituted, because the authors of such things
thought that by these works they were meriting grace. Thus in times past
the Penitential Canons increased, whereof we still see some traces in
the satisfactions. Again, the authors of traditions do contrary to the command of God when
they find matters of sin in foods, in days, and like things, and burden
the Church with bondage of the law, as if there ought to be among
Christians, in order to merit justification a service like the
Levitical, the arrangement of which God had committed to the Apostles

"The titles of certain of the lost plays indicate the comic illumining
character; a Self-pitier, a Self-chastiser, an Ill-tempered man, a
Superstitious, an Incredulous, etc., point to suggestive domestic themes. Terence forwarded manuscript translations from Greece, that suffered
shipwreck; he, who could have restored the treasure, died on the way
home. The zealots of Byzantium completed the work of destruction. So we
have the four comedies of Terence, numbering six of Menander, with a few
sketches of plots--one of them, the Thesaurus, introduces a miser, whom
we should have liked to contrast with Harpagon--and a multitude of small
fragments of a sententious cast, fitted for quotation. Enough remains to
make his greatness felt.",1219,1800s

"His tone was warm but the gun never wavered. When he made his
connection he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece, too rapidly for
Dirrul to work out an accurate translation. It seemed, however, that

"I met with this sort of cotton afterwards at Timor (where
it was ripe in November) and nowhere else in all my travels; but I found
two other sorts of silk-cotton at Brazil, which I shall there describe. The right cotton-shrub grows here also, but not on the sandbank. I saw
some bushes of it near the shore; but the most of it is planted in the
middle of the isle, where the inhabitants live, cotton-cloth being their
chief manufacture; but neither is there any great store of this cotton. There also are some trees within the island, but none to be seen near the
seaside; nothing but a few bushes scattering up and down against the
sides of the adjacent hills; for as I said before the land is pretty high
from the sea. The soil is for the most part either a sort of sand, or
loose crumbling stone, without any fresh-water ponds or streams to
moisten it, but only showers in the wet season which run off as fast as
they fall, except a small spring in the middle of the isle, from which
proceeds a little stream of water that runs through a valley between the
hills.",15675,1600s

"“What sort of a place is it, anyway, Ixtli?” he demanded, but the Aztec
was too hurried for words, just then, save enough to warn his companion
in peril that they must descend deeper into the earth. It was more of a scramble than a deliberate descent, for the gloom was
complete, and Bruno had no time in which to feel for steps or stairs. Only for the aiding touch of his guide, he must have taken more than one
awkward tumble ere that lower level was attained. Then a breathing-spell was granted him, and, while Ixtli bent ear in
listening to discover if pursuit was being made, Bruno drew a match
from the liberal supply he had taken the precaution to fetch along,
and, striking it, held aloft the tiny torch to view their present
surroundings. Only to give an involuntary start and cry as he caught indistinct
glimpses of fleshless bones and grinning skulls, those grim relics of
mortality showing upon every side as his wild eyes roved around.",783,1800s
"The feud might, perhaps, have died down or been
compromised if the personal ill-will of the two men had not stood in the
way; as boys they had thirsted for one another’s blood, as men each
prayed that misfortune might fall on the other, and this wind-scourged
winter night Ulrich had banded together his foresters to watch the dark
forest, not in quest of four-footed quarry, but to keep a look-out for
the prowling thieves whom he suspected of being afoot from across the
land boundary. The roebuck, which usually kept in the sheltered hollows
during a storm-wind, were running like driven things to-night, and there
was movement and unrest among the creatures that were wont to sleep
through the dark hours. Assuredly there was a disturbing element in the
forest, and Ulrich could guess the quarter from whence it came. He strayed away by himself from the watchers whom he had placed in ambush
on the crest of the hill, and wandered far down the steep slopes amid the
wild tangle of undergrowth, peering through the tree trunks and listening
through the whistling and skirling of the wind and the restless beating
of the branches for sight and sound of the marauders. If only on this
wild night, in this dark, lone spot, he might come across Georg Znaeym,
man to man, with none to witness—that was the wish that was uppermost in
his thoughts.",1477,1800s
"Cap. 17.] It has been (pursues _Carneades_) by our Friend here present observ'd
concerning Salt-petre, that none of the substances into which the Fire
is wont to divide it, retaines either the Tast, the cooling vertue, or
some other of the properties of the Concrete; and that each of those
Substances acquires new qualities, not to be found in the Salt-Petre
it self. The shining property of the tayls of gloworms does survive
but so short a time the little animal made conspicuous by it, that
inquisitive men have not scrupled publickly to deride _Baptista Porta_
and others; who deluded perhaps with some Chymical surmises have
ventur'd to prescribe the distillation of a Water from the tayles of
Glowormes, as a sure way to obtain a liquor shining in the Dark. To
which I shall now add no other example than that afforded us by Amber;
which, whilst it remains an intire body, is endow'd with an Electrical
faculty of drawing to it self fethers, strawes, and such like Bodies;
which I never could observe either in its Salt, its Spirit, its Oyle,
or in the Body I remember I once made by the reunion of its divided
Elements; none of these having such a Texture as the intire Concrete.",22914,1600s

"When Tim O'Connor turned his back upon most of the things he was born
to and took up with the life which he consistently lived till the
unspeakable end, he was unable to get rid of certain peculiarities. For
example, in spite of all his debauchery, he continued to look like the
Beloved Apostle. Notwithstanding abject friendships he wrote limpid and
noble English. Purity seemed to dog his heels, no matter how violently
he attempted to escape from her. He was never so drunk that he was
not an exquisite, and even his creditors, who had become inured to his
deceptions, confessed it was a privilege to meet so perfect a gentleman.",1876,1800s

   But I did practise thus before my want;
   Like to a Tilter that would win the prize,
   Before the day he'll often exercise. So I began to put in use, at first
   These principles 'gainst hunger, 'gainst thirst. Close to the Gate,[4] there dwelt a worthy man,
   That well could take his whiff, and quaff his can,
   Right Robin Good-fellow, but humours evil,
   Do call him _Robin Pluto_, or the devil. But finding him a devil, freely hearted,
   With friendly farewells I took leave and parted,
   And as alongst I did my journey take,
   I drank at _Broom's well_, for pure fashion's sake,
   Two miles I travelled then without a bait,
   The Saracen's Head at _Whetstone_ entering straight,

of the orange trees on the broad back terrace, and of the lemons ripening
on the wall, and of some shrubs that grew around a broken fountain, had

A MULE AND A CART

Frank Fowler's heart was filled with longing for a sight of Rena's
face. When she had gone away first, on the ill-fated trip to South
Carolina, her absence had left an aching void in his life; he had
missed her cheerful smile, her pleasant words, her graceful figure
moving about across the narrow street. His work had grown monotonous
during her absence; the clatter of hammer and mallet, that had seemed
so merry when punctuated now and then by the strains of her voice,
became a mere humdrum rapping of wood upon wood and iron upon iron. He
had sought work in South Carolina with the hope that he might see her. He had satisfied this hope, and had tried in vain to do her a service;
but Fate had been against her; her castle of cards had come tumbling
down.",472,1800s

"The duke then
arranged with Ferrando to take him into pay, with the title of captain
of his forces, and give him 100,000 florins for his maintenance. After
this agreement, Jacopo, accompanied by a ducal ambassador and his wife
Drusiana, proceeded to Naples, where he was honorably and joyfully
received, and for many days entertained with every kind of festivity;
but having asked permission to go to Sulmona, where his forces were, the
king invited him to a banquet in the castle, at the conclusion of which
he and his son Francesco were imprisoned, and shortly afterward put to
death. It was thus our Italian princes, fearing those virtues in others
which they themselves did not possess, extirpated them; and hence the
country became a prey to the efforts of those by whom it was not long
afterward oppressed and ruined. At this time, Pope Pius II. having settled the affairs of Romagna, and
witnessing a universal peace, thought it a suitable opportunity to lead
the Christians against the Turks, and adopted measures similar to those
which his predecessors had used.",2464,1400s
"Old
Piety (Maintenon) did not commit this crime without an object; but if she
really did poison Louvois, it was because he had opposed her designs and
endeavoured to undeceive the King. Louvois, the better to gain his
object, had advised the King not to take her with him to the army. The
King was weak enough to repeat this to her, and this it was that excited
her against Louvois. That the latter was a very bad man, who feared
neither heaven nor hell, no man can deny; but it must be confessed that
he served his King faithfully. The Duke de Noailles' grandfather was one of the ugliest men in the

"Yet the _Indians_ were
sedated by the promises of the Religious; for they told them, they
would send Letters by the first Ship that was bound for _Hispaniola_,
whereby they would procure the Restitution and Return of their Lord and
his Retinue. It pleased God to send a Ship thither forthwith, to the
greater confirming of the Governours Damnation, where in the Letters
they sent to the Religious of _Hispaniola_, Letters containing repeated
Exclamations and Protestations, and protest against such Actions, but
those that received them denyed them Justice, for that they were
partakers of that Prey, made of those _Indians_ so injustly and
impiously captivated. But when the Religious, who had engag'd to the
Inhabitants, that their Lord _Alphonsus_ should be restor'd within Four
Moneths, and found that neither in Four, nor Eight Moneths he was
return'd, they prepar'd themselves for Death, and to deliver up their
Life to Christ, to whom they had offer'd it before their departure from
_Spain_: Thus the Innocent _Indians_ were revenged on the Innocent
Priests; for they were of Opinion, that the Religious had a hand in the
Plot, partly, because they found their Promises that their Lord should
return within Four Moneths, ineffectual, and partly because the
Inhabitants made no difference between a Religious Frier and a
_Spanish_ Rogue. At another time it fell out likewise, through the
Rampant Tyrrany and Cruel Deeds of evil-minded Christians, that the
_Indians_ put to Death two _Dominican_ Friers, of which I am a faithful
Witness, escaping my self, not without a very great Miracle, which
Transaction I resolve silently to pass over, lest I should terrifie the
Reader with the Horror of the Fact. In these Provinces, there was a City seated on the Bay of _Codera_,
whose Lord was call'd _Higueroto_, a Name, either proper to Persons or
common to the Rulers of that Place.",20321,1400s
"Why am I eager thus to prove,
To him who feels excess of love,
The tender liking we bestow
On fair and guileless things below? On Love and Joy without pretence,
On kind and playful Innocence! The pleas'd idea Memory kept,
The partial glance which never slept,
When hopes arose oft render'd vain,
Of seeing Keswick yet again. Never but once a child had won
So much upon me as thy son;
And, for each wild and winning art,
That, nestling, fastens in the heart;
For graces that light tendrils fling
Around each nerve's tenacious string;
Caprices beautiful, that strike
The heart, and captive fancy, like
Those of a tame, young bird at play,
That carols near, then flits away,
Will on a sudden upward soar,
Then give its little wanderings o'er,
For fondling, gentle, sweet repose,
When tapering pinions softly close,
Slight, warmth--pervaded quills are prest,
And head shrunk closely to the breast:
All sleeping but that lovely eye,
Which speaks delight, and asks reply:
Oh! with such graces never one
Was so much gifted as thy son!",11194,1700s

better voice now, and a clearer and louder pipe, than at any other

gloomy, as some persons pretend, who know no better; to whom, in

in turn the prey of Saxons, Danes, Normans, &c. merely
glance our eyes upon those provinces which have been
subjugated by more civilized Europe. Look at South America

not been far exceeded by the Spaniards, in that portion
of the hemisphere--and yet, with this vast difference in
the balance, that there the European drove before him
and mercilessly destroyed an unoffending race, while we,
on the contrary, have had fierce hostility and treachery
every where opposed to our progress. The Spaniards,
moreover, offered no equivalent for the country subdued;
now we have ever done so, and only where that equivalent
has been rejected, have we found ourselves compelled to

often referred to as the stronghold of the Navajos. Although Mexican
reprisals often forced the Indians to take temporary refuge north of the
San Juan River, they were too sporadic to effectively quell the raiders,

Navajos boasted they let the Mexicans live on only because they made
good shepherds for the tribe. The taunt hardly exaggerated their power

of a woman who lived at the house as servant girl at the time, and who

came off, only suspected by a few. The inutility of attempting to do away entirely with this popular

Letter Seventeenth To Anne Boleyn


The reasonable request of your last letter, with the pleasure also that I
take to know them true, causeth me to send you these news. The legate
which we most desire arrived at Paris on Sunday or Monday last past, so
that I trust by the next Monday to hear of his arrival at Calais: and then
I trust within a while after to enjoy that which I have so long longed
for, to God's pleasure and our both comforts. No more to you at this present, mine own darling, for lack of time, but

"Yet,
notwithstanding this great success of my schemes, I cannot say I was
perfectly happy; for every woman that was taken the least notice of, and
every man that was insensible to my arts, gave me as much pain as all
the rest gave me pleasure; and sometimes little underhand plots which
were laid against my designs would succeed in spite of my care: so that
I really began to grow weary of this manner of life, when my father,
returning from his embassy in France, took me home with him, and carried
me to a little pleasant country-house, where there was nothing grand
or superfluous, but everything neat and agreeable. There I led a life
perfectly solitary. At first the time hung very heavy on my hands, and
I wanted all kind of employment, and I had very like to have fallen into
the height of the vapors, from no other reason but from want of knowing
what to do with myself. But when I had lived here a little time I found
such a calmness in my mind, and such a difference between this and the
restless anxieties I had experienced in a court, that I began to share
the tranquillity that visibly appeared in everything round me. I set
myself to do works of fancy, and to raise little flower-gardens, with
many such innocent rural amusements; which, although they are not
capable of affording any great pleasure, yet they give that serene turn
to the mind which I think much preferable to anything else human nature
is made susceptible of.",1147,1700s

own Society, with a view of answering their arguments, and of endeavouring
to evince the wickedness and impolicy of slavery. In discoursing with
these, however strenuous he might appear, he seems never to have departed
from a calm, modest, and yet dignified and even friendly demeanour. At the
public meetings for discipline, held by his own Society in these provinces,
he endeavoured to display the same truths and in the same manner, but
particularly to the elders of his own Society, exhorting them, as the most
conspicuous rank, to be careful of their conduct, and to give a bright
example in the liberation of their slaves. He visited also families for the
same purpose: and he had the well-earned satisfaction of finding his
admonitions kindly received by some, and of seeing a disposition in
others to follow the advice he had given them. In the year 1758, he attended the yearly meeting at Philadelphia, where he

never known before, and trees dressed each day in lovelier and lovelier
dresses. The rains fell in the cities and on the plains. In valleys and

he will render us much better service than in prison."" The victory of Steinau was followed by the capture of Liegnitz,
Grossglogau, and even of Frankfort on the Oder. Schafgotsch, who
remained in Silesia to complete the subjugation of that province,
blockaded Brieg, and threatened Breslau, though in vain, as that free

Apparently realizing that she had paraded her personal affairs, Miss
Swenster quickly changed the subject. They continued their tour of the

St. _Stephen_, in a Place called _Sigma_. The _Sigma_ therefore here
intended, must needs be another Place in the City, distinct from that

"It may suffice for
the present to relate some passages  written in a Letter to our King
and Lord by a Revernd Bishop of these Provinces, Dated the 20th of
_May, An. Dom._ 1541. wherein among other matters he thus words it. I must acquaint your Sacred Majesty, that the only way to succour and
 support this tottering Region is to free it from the Power of a Father
 in Law, and marry it to a Husband who will treat her as she ought to be,
 and lovingly entertain her, and that must be done with all possible
 Expedition too, if not, I am certain that she will suddenly decay and
 come to nothing by the covetous and sordid Deportment of the Governours,
 _&c._  And a little after he writes thus, By this Means your Majesty
 will plainly know and understand how to depose the Prefects or Governours
 of those Regions from their Office if they deserve it, that so they may
 be alleviated and eas'd of such Burthens; which if not perform'd, in
 my Opinion, the Body Politick will never recover its Health. And this I
 will make appear to your Majesty that they are not Christians, but Devils;
 not Servants of God and the King, but Traitors to the King and Laws,
 who are Conversant in those Regions. And in reality nothing can be more
 obstructive to those that live peacably, then Inhumane and Barbarous
 Usage, which they, who lead a quiet and peacable Life, too frequently
 undergo, and this is so fastidious and nauseous to them, that there can
 be nothing in the World so odious and detestable among them, as the
 Name of a Christian: for they term the Christians in their Language
 _Yares_, that is, Devils; and in truth are not without reason; for
 the Actions of those that reside in these Regions, are not such as
 speak them to be Christians or Men, gifted with Reason, but absolute
 Devils; hence it is, that the _Indians_, perceiving these Actions
 committed by the Heads as well as Members, who are void of all Compassion
 and Humanity, do judge the Christian Laws to be of the same strain and
 temper, and that their God and King are the Authors of such Enormities:
 Now to endeavour to work upon them a contrary perswasion is to no purpose;
 for this would afford them a greater Latitude and Liberty to deride
 Jesus Christ and his Laws.",20321,1400s

concernedly. She dropped the phone into its cradle, rose, and went back to the

"Mine are horrible, social ghosts,—
   Speeches and women and guests and hosts,
   Weddings and morning calls and toasts,
      In every bad variety:
   Ghosts who hover about the grave
   Of all that’s manly, free, and brave:
   You’ll find their names on the architrave
      Of that charnel-house, Society. Black Monday—black as its school-room ink—
   With its dismal boys that snivel and think
   Of its nauseous messes to eat and drink,
      And its frozen tank to wash in. That was the first that brought me grief,
   And made me weep, till I sought relief
   In an emblematical handkerchief,
      To choke such baby bosh in. First and worst in the grim array—
   Ghosts of ghosts that have gone their way,
   Which I wouldn’t revive for a single day
      For all the wealth of PLUTUS—
   Are the horrible ghosts that school-days scared:
   If the classical ghost that BRUTUS dared
   Was the ghost of his “Cæsar” unprepared,

"The promise is useless unless it is received by faith. But the
Sacraments are the signs [and seals] of the promises. Therefore, in
the use of the Sacraments faith ought to be added so that, if any one
use the Lord's Supper, he use it thus. Because this is a Sacrament
of the New Testament, as Christ clearly says, he ought for this very
reason to be confident that what is promised in the New Testament
namely, the free remission of sins, is offered him. And let him
receive this by faith, let him comfort his alarmed conscience, and
know that these testimonies are not fallacious, but as sure as though
[and still surer than if] God by a new miracle would declare from
heaven that it was His will to grant forgiveness.",6744,1400s

"This we may see in the philosophers, who, although they
endeavored to live an honest life could not succeed, but were defiled
with many open crimes. Such is the feebleness of man when he is without
faith and without the Holy Ghost, and governs himself only by human
strength. Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be charged
with prohibiting good works, but rather the more to be commended,
because it shows how we are enabled to do good works. For without faith
human nature can in no wise do the works of the First or of the Second
Commandment. Without faith it does not call upon God, nor expect
anything from God, nor bear the cross, but seeks, and trusts in, man's
help.",275,1400s

groaned all day, and said not a word to any one. Scythrop had
quarrelled, as usual, with Marionetta, and was enclosed in his tower,
in a fit of morbid sensibility. Marionetta was comforting herself at

  Within his bending sickle's compass come,

"And for this there are many reasons. For it is necessary to
understand what it is that principally makes us members, and that,
living members, of the Church. If we will define the Church only as
an outward polity of the good and wicked, men will not understand
that the kingdom of Christ is righteousness of heart and the gift of
the Holy Ghost [that the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, as
nevertheless it is, that therein Christ inwardly rules, strengthens,
and comforts hearts, and imparts the Holy Ghost and various spiritual
gifts], but they will judge that it is only the outward observance of
certain forms of worship and rites. Likewise, what difference will
there be between the people of the Law and the Church if the Church
is an outward polity? But Paul distinguishes the Church from the
people of the Law thus, that the Church is a spiritual people, i.e.,
that it has been distinguished from the heathen not by civil rites
[not in the polity and civil affairs], but that it is the true people
of God, regenerated by the Holy Ghost.",6744,1400s

adversaries observe the form given in the canons. This topic concerning traditions contains many and difficult
questions of controversy and we have actually experienced that
traditions are truly snares of consciences. When they are exacted as
necessary, they torture in wonderful ways the conscience omitting any
observance [as godly hearts, indeed, experience when in the canonical
hours they have omitted a compline, or offended against them in a
similar way]. Again their abrogation has its own evils and its own

"Because every
public action that was ever taken can be regarded as the private act,
the personal decision of somebody, historic events can become materials
for the novel, in spite of the fact that public affairs and political
matters are not in themselves issues for a novel. The novelist looking at a historic figure sees personality where the
scientific historian is tempted to see only the incarnation of a
policy. He feels flesh and blood where the ordinary history-reader
complains that he is given only abstractions. Every historic decision
that comes under his review has for him a context in the mind of the
man who made it and not simply in the politics of the day. Behind every
great name he sees a human being, with a peculiar experience of life;
even if history does not tell of the experience he knows it is there,
he thinks it into history and endows the man with it, and he completes
the personality in his imagination, bringing in fiction to supply what
history fails to give.",72375,1900s

But if such earnest and hastie heaping vp of speaches be made by way of
recapitulation, which commonly is in the end of euery long tale and
Oration, because the speaker seemes to make a collection of all the former
materiall points, to binde them as it were in a bundle and lay them forth

Maiestie entitled [_Mourua_] wherein speaking of the mutabilitie of
fortune in the case of all Princes generally, wee seemed to exempt her
Maiestie of all such casualtie, by reason she was by her destinie and many

She thought of that. “This is better perhaps; but as we were—it was
good.”

He put her the question. “Did it never happen that he spoke of me?”

Considering more intently she made no answer, and he then knew he should
have been adequately answered by her asking how often he himself had
spoken of their terrible friend. Suddenly a brighter light broke in her
face and an excited idea sprang to her lips in the appeal: “You _have_
forgiven him?”

“How, if I hadn’t, could I linger here?”

She visibly winced at the deep but unintended irony of this; but even
while she did so she panted quickly: “Then in the lights on your altar—?”

“There’s never a light for Acton Hague!”

She stared with a dreadful fall, “But if he’s one of your Dead?”

                             JOHN OGILBY,


This poet, who was likewise an eminent Geographer and Cosmographer,
was born near Edinburgh in the year 1600[1]. His father, who was of an
ancient and genteel family, having spent his estate, and being
prisoner in the King's Bench for debt, could give his son but little
education at school; but our author, who, in his early years
discovered the most invincible industry, obtained a little knowledge
in the Latin grammar, and afterwards so much money, as not only to
procure his father's discharge from prison, but also to bind himself
apprentice to Mr. Draper a dancing master in Holbourn, London. Soon
after, by his dexterity in his profession, and his complaisant
behaviour to his master's employers, he obtained the favour of them to
lend him as much money as to buy out the remaining part of his time,
and set up for himself; but being afterwards appointed to dance in the
duke of Buckingham's great Masque, by a false step, he strained a vein
in the inside of his leg, which ever after occasioned him to halt.",16469,1700s

"The bones of his gallant army

returned have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared

proceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. “Is
Richard’s title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of
Duke Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror’s eldest son? And yet William

preferred to him by the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit
which can be pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader,
generous to his friends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a
crusader and a conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind
and miserable prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed
himself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not rule

"There is, in fact, no way of knowing with certainty if Dury's motives
were ""impure,"" especially since the exact date of the tract cannot be
determined, no entry existing for it in the Stationers' Register. According to one of Dury's biographers, but with no reference to source,
the pamphlet was printed by William Dugard ""shortly after"" the latter's
release from prison in the early spring of 1650. [9] The Calendar of
State Papers and the records of Bulstrode Whitelocke indicate that Dury
was not officially considered for the library post before late summer
and not appointed until 28 October. [10]

The contents of the letters themselves reveal Dury far ahead of his time
in his conception of the Complete Librarian, but later commentators have
generally not understood that the administrative reforms he advocated
were inseparable from his idea of the sacramental nature of the
librarian's office--and so have tended to dismiss the second letter
because it ""merely repeats the ideas of the first with less practical
suggestion and in a more declamatory style. ""[11] Such a comment

"Had I been a sordid and interested man, this news could never have given
me the satisfaction it did, for Miss Lizy was very fond of my bairns, and
it was thought that Peter would have been her heir; but so far from being
concerned at what I heard, I rejoiced thereat, and resolved in secret
thought, whenever a vacancy happened, Dr Swapkirk being then fast wearing
away, to exert the best of my ability to get the kirk for Mr Pittle, not,
however, unless he was previously married to Miss Lizy; for, to speak
out, she was beginning to stand in need of a protector, and both me and
Mrs Pawkie had our fears that she might outlive her income, and in her
old age become a cess upon us. And it couldna be said that this was any
groundless fear; for Miss Lizy, living a lonely maiden life by herself,
with only a bit lassie to run her errands, and no being naturally of an
active or eydent turn, aften wearied, and to keep up her spirits gaed may
be, now and then, oftener to the gardevin than was just necessar, by
which, as we thought, she had a tavert look. Howsever, as Mr Pittle had
taken a notion of her, and she pleased his fancy, it was far from our
hand to misliken one that was sib to us; on the contrary, it was a duty
laid on me by the ties of blood and relationship, to do all in my power
to further their mutual affection into matrimonial fruition; and what I
did towards that end, is the burden of this current chapter. Dr Swapkirk, in whom the spark of life was long fading, closed his eyes,

the hours of eleven and twelve. We had that afternoon got an inkling

"_Bu-t no`ne o`f, u-s a`ll tre`we._

Therefore whensoeuer your words will not make a smooth _dactil_, ye must
alter them or their situations or else turne them to other feete that may
better beare their maner of sound and orthographie: or if the word be
_polysillable_ to deuide him, and to make him serue by peeces, that he
could not do whole and entierly. And no doubt by like consideration did
the Greeke & Latine versifiers fashion all their feete at the first to be
of sundry times, and the selfe same sillable to be sometime long and
sometime short for the eares better satisfaction as hath bene before
remembred. Now also wheras I said before that our old Saxon English for
his many _monosillables_ did not naturally admit the vse of the ancient
feete in our vulgar measures so aptly as in those languages which stood
most vpon _polisillables_, I sayd it in a sort truly, but now I must
recant and confesse that our Normane English which hath growen since
_William_ the Conquerour doth admit any of the auncient feete, by reason
of the many _polysillables_ euen to sixe and seauen in one word, which we
at this day vse in our most ordinarie language: and which corruption hath
bene occasioned chiefly by the peeuish affectation not of the Normans them
selues, but of clerks and scholars or secretaries long since, who not
content with the vsual Normane or Saxon word, would conuert the very
Latine and Greeke word into vulgar French, as to say innumerable for
innombrable, reuocable, irreuocable, irradiation, depopulation & such
like, which are not naturall Normane nor yet French, but altered Latines,
and without any imitation at all: which therefore were long time despised
for inkehorne termes, and now be reputed the best & most delicat of any
other. Of which & many other causes of corruption of our speach we haue in
another place more amply discoursed, but by this meane we may at this day
very well receiue the auncient feete _metricall_ of the Greeks and Latines
sauing those that be superfluous as be all the feete aboue the
_trissillable_, which the old Grammarians idly inuented and distinguisht
by speciall names, whereas in deede the same do stand compounded with the
inferiour feete, and therefore some of them were called by the names of
_didactilus_, _dispondeus_, and _disiambus:_ which feete as I say we may
be allowed to vse with good discretion & precise choise of wordes and with
the fauorable approbation of readers, and so shall our plat in this one
point be larger and much surmount that which _Stamhurst_ first tooke in
hand by his _exameters dactilicke_ and _spondaicke_ in the translation of
_Virgills Eneidos_, and such as for a great number of them my stomacke can
hardly digest for the ill shapen sound of many of his wordes
_polisillable_ and also his copulation of _monosillables_ supplying the
quantitie of a _trissillable_ to his intent. And right so in promoting
this deuise of ours being (I feare me) much more nyce and affected, and
therefore more misliked then his, we are to bespeake fauour, first of the
delicate eares, then of the rigorous and seuere dispositions, lastly to
craue pardon of the learned & auncient makers in our vulgar, for if we
should seeke in euery point to egall our speach with the Greeke and Latin
in their _metricall_ observations it could not possible be by vs
perfourmed, because their sillables came to be timed some of them long,
some of them short not by reason of any euident or apparant cause in
writing or sounde remaining vpon one more then another, for many times
they shortned the sillable of sharpe accent and made long that of the
flat, & therefore we must needes say, it was in many of their wordes done

_ortographie_, and hardnesse or softnesse of a sillable, consonant, vowell

put in a verse this word [_Penelope_] which might be _Homer_ or some other
of his antiquitie, where he made [_pe-_] in both places long and [_ne`_]

pleased the Poet otherwise: so he that first shortned, _ca_, in this word
_cano_, and made long _tro_, in _troia_, and _o_, in _oris_, might haue
aswell done the contrary, but because he that first put them into a verse,
found as it is to be supposed a more sweetnesse in his owne eare to haue
them so tymed, therefore all other Poets who followed, were fayne to doe
the like, which made that _Virgill_ who came many yeares after the first

sympathize with the generous qualities of the poet than to sport with his

occasionally had him to his seat in the country. Goldsmith appreciated his
sympathy, and unburdened himself to him without reserve. Seeing the

"If the stranger at Paris is struck by the magnificent appearance which
the exterior of the Louvre presents, he cannot fail of being delighted
with an inspection of the contents of its invaluable Museum. This, like
nearly all the museums and libraries in Paris, is open to _every
individual_, except on the days appropriated for study, when only
_artists_ are admitted; but even then, a stranger, whose stay is
limited, may be admitted on producing his _passport_, a regulation which
is highly commendable for its liberality; and at none of these
repositories are the attendants permitted to lay any contributions on
the visitants. The gallery of the Louvre was built by Henry IV. to join
that palace with the Tuilleries, from which it was formerly separated,
by the walls which surrounded Paris. This vast gallery is _two hundred
toises_ in length (not a great deal short of a quarter of an English
mile); the collection of works of art here in without any parallel, as
in this place are assembled most of the finest paintings and statues in

meat, as well in regard to quantity as to quality, accustoming
myself never to cloy my stomach with eating or drinking; but
constantly rise from table with a disposition to eat and drink
still more. In this I conformed to the proverb, which says, that
a man, to consult his health, must check his appetite. Having in
this manner, and for these reasons, conquered intemperance and
irregularity, I betook myself intirely to a temperate and regular
life: which effected in me the alteration already mentioned, that
is, in less than a year it rid me of all those disorders, which
had taken so deep a root in me; nay, as I have already observed,
had made such a progress, as to be in a manner incurable. It had
likewise this other good effect, that I no longer experienced
those annual fits of sickness, with which I used to be afflicted,
while I followed a different, that is a sensual, course of life;
for then I used to be attacked every year with a strange kind of
fever, which sometimes brought me to death's door. From this
disease, then, I also freed myself, and became exceeding healthy,
as I have continued from that time forward to this very day; and
for no other reason than that I never trespassed against
regularity, which by its infinite efficacy has been the cause,
that the meat I constantly eat, and the wine I constantly drink,

"_Dear Sister_,

It is no little grief to me on this side the grave, to hear what a low
ebb the good old trade of basket-making is reduc’d to in the age you
live in; for I hear it is as much as a woman of tolerable beauty, and
reasonable share of experience can well do, to keep clean smocks to her
back, and pay her surgeon; when in my time, praised be the l--rd for it,
I kept my family as neat and sweet, poor girls, as any alderman’s
daughters in the city of _London_. I don’t know what scandal our
profession may be dwindled into since my departure from the upper world;
but I am sure thro’ the course of my life, I was look’d upon by the
whole city to be as honest an old gentlewoman, as ever hazarded her soul
for the service of her country; and always took care to deal in as good
commodities, as any shopkeeper in _London_ could desire to have the
handling of, true, wholesom country-ware; whole waggon-loads have I had
come up at a time, have dress’d them at my own expence, made them fit
for man’s use, and put them into a saleable condition. The clergy, I am
sure, were much beholden to me, for many a poor parson’s daughter have I
taken care on, bought her shifts to her back, put a trade into her
belly, taught her a pleasant livelihood, that she might support herself
like a woman, without being beholden to any body; who otherwise must
have turn’d drudge, waited upon some proud minx or other, or else have
depended upon relations; yet these unmannerly priests had the sinful
ingratitude before I dy’d, to refuse praying for me in their churches;
tho’ I dealt by all people with a conscience, and was so well beloved in
the parish I liv’d in, that the churchwardens themselves became my daily
customers. My home was always a sanctuary for distressed ladies; I never refus’d
meat, drink, washing, lodging, and cloaths, to any that had the least
spark of wit, youth, beauty, or gentility, to recommend them to my
charity; ladies women, chambermaids, cookmaids of any sort, when out of
service, were at all times welcome to my table, ’till they could better
provide for themselves; and I am sure, tho’ I say it that should not, I
kept as hospitable a house for all comers and goers, as any woman in
_England_; for the best of flesh was never wanting to delight the
appetites of both sexes; the toppingest shopkeepers in the city us’d now
and then to visit me for a good supper; and I never fail’d of having a
tid-bit ready for them; dainties that were hot and hot, never over-done,
but always with the gravy in them, which pleas’d them so wonderfully,
that they us’d to cry their own victuals at home was meer carrion to it;
nay, their very wives, sometimes, contrary to their own husbands
knowledge, have tripp’d in, in an evening, complain’d they have been as
hungry as hawks, and desired me to provide a morsel for them that might
satisfy their bellies; for you must know, both sexes were wonderful
lovers of my cookery, and would feed very heartily upon such nice
dainties that I toss’d up for them, when no other sort of flesh would by
any means go down with them. Many hopeful babes have been beholden to my
mansion-house for their generation; who tho’ they were never wise enough
to know their own father, yet some of them, for ought I know, may at
this day be aldermen; for I have had as good merchants ladies, as ever
liv’d in _Mincing-lane_, apply themselves to my fertile habitation for
change of diet; and have come twice or thrice a week to refresh nature
with my standing dishes; for I always kept an open house to feast
lovers; and, _Jove_ be thanked, never wanted variety to gratify the
appetites of mankind.",69126,1600s

compounded Liquors; which, if what I have supposed be true, that it is
by the means spoken of that this Fire is collected and driven on, as I
have said, it is plain to be seen, that at the Finger’s End of a Person
electrify’d, or at the End of a Sword, held as before described, being
in a dark Room, a Flame issues from them: It is no Wonder then, that an
inflammable Spirit, as is shewn, should take Fire from it. The second Thing I proposed to shew is, Why a Tube of Glass, rubb’d
smartly in the Hand, so as to become electrical, repels Leaf-Gold,
Feathers, and other small Bodies; and when they touch any less
electrify’d Body, they shall return back again to the Tube, and so _vice

_Phænomenon_ be otherwise? For, if that Piece of Leaf-Gold, _&c._ be
electrify’d by the Touch of the Tube, then it has as full Power given to
it as the electrify’d Body had to give to it: And when the Gold, _&c._
touches any other Body, it imparts to it so much of its electrical
Property as it had in itself: And then it may be consider’d in the same
State it was in when first electrify’d: And so it will be repeatedly
attracted to it, and be repell’d _toties quoties_. But it may be asked, What causes these attractive and repulsive

the chill shudder of repulsion-- powerless, because I could be acted

social vanities, to all the incentives within the compass of her narrow
imagination, and I lived under influences utterly invisible to her. She was really pitiable to have such a husband, and so all the world

the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and
esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be obliged to pass our
lives with those we hate or contemn. A very play or romance may afford
us instances of this pleasure, which virtue conveys to us; and pain,
which arises from vice. Now since the distinguishing impressions, by which moral good or evil is
known, are nothing but particular pains or pleasures; it follows,
that in all enquiries concerning these moral distinctions, it will be
sufficient to shew the principles, which make us feel a satisfaction or
uneasiness from the survey of any character, in order to satisfy us

holy-days, rites, fasts, and vestures. These observances had won for
themselves the exalted title of being the spiritual life and the
perfect life. Meanwhile the commandments of God, according to each

"HAVE you no truckle bed? the lover cried;
          No corner left?--we fain would here abide:
          Why, truly, said the host, we always keep
          Two beds within the chamber where we sleep;
          My wife and I, of course, take one of these;
          Together lie in t'other if you please. The spark replied, this we will gladly do;
          Come, supper get; that o'er, the friends withdrew:
          Pinucio, by Coletta's sage advice,
          In looking o'er the room was very nice;
          With eagle-eyes particulars he traced,
          Then 'tween the clothes himself and friend he placed. A camp-bed for the girl was on the floor;
          The landlord's, 'gainst the wall and next the door;
          Another opposite the last was set,
          And this, to guests, at certain times was let;
          And 'tween the two, but near the parents' best,
          A cradle for the child to rest its head,
          From which a pleasant accident arrived,
          That our gallant's young friend of rest deprived. WHEN midnight came, and this gay spark supposed
          The host and hostess' eyes in sleep were closed,
          Convinced the time appointed was at hand,
          To put in execution what was planned,
          He to the camp-bed silently repaired,
          And found the belle by Morpheus not insnared;
          Coletta taught a play that mortals find
          Fatigues the body more than plagues the mind:
          A truce succeeded, but 'twas quickly o'er:
          Those rest not long who pilfer Cupid's store.",5286,1600s
"I do not pretend to elevate my sentiments above those of others, but I
relate simply what has been my own experience as well as that of
others, and the advantage which I have found in this simple and natural
manner of going to God. If this book treats of nothing else but the _short and easy method of
prayer_, it is because, being written only for that, it cannot speak of
other things. It is certain that, if it be read in the spirit in which
it has been written, there will be found nothing in it to shock the
mind. Those who will make the experience of it will be the most certain
of the truth which it contains. It is to Thee, O Holy Child Jesus, who lovest simplicity and innocence,
and who findest Thy delight in the children of men, that is to say, with
those amongst men who are willing to become children;--it is to Thee, I
say, to give worth and value to this little work, impressing it on the
heart, and leading those who read it to seek Thee within themselves,
where Thou wilt take Thy rest, receiving the tokens of their love, and
giving them proofs of Thine.",24989,1600s
"“Doubled,” said Lady Caroline, with increased gentleness, and a few
minutes later she was pencilling an addition of twenty-four to her score. “I stayed with his people down in Herefordshire last May,” said Ada,
returning to the unfinished theme of the Canon; “such an exquisite rural
retreat, and so restful and healing to the nerves. Real country scenery;
apple blossom everywhere.”

“Surely only on the apple trees,” said Lady Caroline. Ada Spelvexit gave up the attempt to reproduce the decorative setting of
the Canon’s homelife, and fell back on the small but practical
consolation of scoring the odd trick in her opponent’s declaration of
hearts. “If you had led your highest club to start with, instead of the nine, we
should have saved the trick,” remarked Lady Caroline to her partner in a
tone of coldly, gentle reproof; “it’s no use, my dear,” she continued, as
Serena flustered out a halting apology, “no earthly use to attempt to
play bridge at one table and try to see and hear what’s going on at two
or three other tables.”

“I can generally manage to attend to more than one thing at a time,” said
Serena, rashly; “I think I must have a sort of double brain.”

“Much better to economise and have one really good one,” observed Lady
Caroline.",555,1800s

"After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came
here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said ""Please, please for

"For his theater Offenbach
wrote many operettas including his masterwork in that genre, _Orpheus in
the Underworld_, in 1858. After closing down the Bouffes Parisiens,
Offenbach went to Germany and Austria where he had produced several more
of his operettas. But in 1864 he was back in Paris. The première of _La
Belle Hélène_ at the Variétés that year enjoyed a spectacular success. Among his later operettas were _La Vie parisienne_ (1866), _La Grande
Duchesse de Gérolstein_ (1867), and _La Périchole_ (1868).",66346,1900s
"_Of the third Valley, and the tenth_ Ward; _of the House of_
  Placidia, _and her Palace; of the_ Aqueduct _of_ Valentinian, _the_
  Bagnio’s _of_ Constantine, _and the_ Nympheum. That the tenth _Ward_ extended itself towards the North, and that it
was situate in the third Valley, and on the East Side of it; as also on
the Top of the _Promontory_, rising above the third Valley, is evident
from the Author of the _Description of the Wards_, who writes, that
the tenth _Ward_ is divided from the ninth by a broad Way; that it
lies much more upon the Level; that ’tis in no part of it uneven, but
near the Sea Shore; that ’tis of a proportionable Length and Breadth;
and that it contains the Church of St. _Achatius_, the _Bagnio’s_ of
_Constantine_, the House of _Placidia Augusta_, and many other fine
Buildings. But I could not find, after the utmost Search and Enquiry,
the Situation of any of them; so that I was obliged to have Recourse
to the Authority of Historians who had wrote of these Matters; and in
consulting them, I could not but take Notice of a Mistake in the Author
_of the Description_, &c. who says, that this _Ward_ contain’d the
_Bagnio’s_ of _Constantine_, whereas I cannot find, that _Constantine_
ever had any _Bagnio’s_ at _Constantinople_, but that _Constantius_
had. For _Sozomen_, speaking of those Persons, who, favouring St.
_Chrysostom_ and his Doctrine, were expelled the City, says, _That
perceiving the People to be furiously enraged against them, they did
not assemble the next Day in the great Church, but celebrated the Holy
Communion in a_ Bagnio, _which was called the_ Bagnio _of_ Constantius. Suidas _reports, that_ Elladius Alexandrinus _wrote a Description of

"I do not, however, mean, that, for the knowledge and cure of
such disorders, as often befall those who do not live regularly,
there is no occasion for a physician, and that his assistance
ought to be slighted. For, if we are apt to receive such great
comfort from friends, who come to visit us in our illness, though
they do no more than testify their concern for us, and bid us be
of good cheer; how much more regard ought we to have for the
physician, who is a friend that comes to see us in order to
relieve us, and promises us a cure? But for the bare purpose of
keeping ourselves in good health, I am of the opinion, that we
should consider as a physician this regular life, which, as we
have seen, is our natural and proper physic, since it preserves
men, even those of a bad constitution, in health; makes them live
sound and hearty to the age of one hundred and upwards; and
prevents their dying of sickness, or through a corruption of their
humours, but merely by a dissolution of their radical moisture,
when quite exhausted; all which effects several wise men have
attributed to potable gold, and the elixir, sought for by many,
but discovered by few. However to confess the truth, men, for
the most part, are very sensual and intemperate, and love to
satisfy their appetites, and to commit every excess; therefore,
seeing that they cannot avoid being greatly injured by such
excess, as often as they are guilty of it, they, by way of
apologizing for their conduct, say, that it is better to live ten
years less, and enjoy themselves; not considering, of what
importance are ten years more of life, especially a healthy life,
and at a maturer age; when men become sensible of their progress
in knowledge and virtue, which cannot attain to any degree of
perfection before this period of life. Not to speak, at present, of many other advantages, I shall
barely mention that in regard to letters and the sciences; far
the greatest number of the best and most celebrated books extant,
were written during that period of life, and those ten years, which
some make it their business to undervalue, in order to give a loose
to their appetites.",30660,1400s
"The expenditures of 1839 were reduced $6,000,000. Those of
1840, exclusive of disbursements for public debt and trust claims, will
probably not exceed twenty-two and a half millions, being between two and
three millions less than those of the preceding year and nine or ten
millions less than those of 1837. Nor has it been found necessary in order
to produce this result to resort to the power conferred by Congress of
postponing certain classes of the public works, except by deferring
expenditures for a short period upon a limited portion of them, and which
postponement terminated some time since--at the moment the Treasury
Department by further receipts from the indebted banks became fully assured
of its ability to meet them without prejudice to the public service in
other respects. Causes are in operation which will, it is believed, justify
a still further reduction without injury to any important national
interest. The expenses of sustaining the troops employed in Florida have
been gradually and greatly reduced through the persevering efforts of the
War Department, and a reasonable hope may be entertained that the necessity
for military operations in that quarter will soon cease.",5017,1700s

"We were now out of sight of land
and had been so 4 or 5 days: but the winds now hanging in the south was
an apparent sign that we were still too nigh the shore to receive the
true general east trade; as the easterly winds we had before showed that
we were too far off the land to have the benefit of the coasting south
trade: and the faintness of both these winds, and their often shifting
from the south-south-west to the south-east with squalls, rain and small
gales, were a confirmation of our being between the verge of the south
coasting trade and that of the true trade; which is here regularly
south-east. The 3rd of May, being in latitude 20 degrees 00 minutes and meridian
distance west from Cape Salvador 234 miles, the variation was 7 degrees
00 minutes. We saw no fowl but shearwaters, as our seamen call them,

"It is every Man's Duty, and it is mine to call upon you, to give
Attention to all the Warnings which God in his Mercy affords to a

Earthquake; a Warning, which seems to have been immediately and
especially directed to these great Cities, and the Neighbourhood of
them; where the Violence of the Earthquake was so sensible, tho' in
distant Parts hardly felt, that it will be Blindness wilful and
inexcusable not to apply to ourselves this strong Summons, from God, to
Repentance. Thoughtless or hardened Sinners may be deaf to these Calls; and Little
Philosophers, who see a little, and but very little into natural
Causes, may think they see enough to account for what happens, without
calling in the Aid and Assistance of a special Providence; not
considering, that God who made all Things, never put any Thing out of
his own Power, but has all Nature under Command to serve his Purposes
in the Government of the World. But be their Imaginations to
themselves, the Subject is too serious for trifling; and calls us off
to other Views. If we consider the general Government of the World by God, and upon
what Reasons and Motives he acts, when he brings Calamities and Plagues
upon any People: Or if we recollect from History sacred and profane,
what State and Condition with respect to Religion and Morality, the
People were in, who have been Examples of Justice: And then compare our
own Case with the general Reason by which Providence acts, and with the
Circumstances of those by whose Example we ought to take Warning, we
shall soon discover whether there be just Reason for our Apprehensions. If those who have been destroyed by Fire from Heaven, or swallowed up
by the Earth were _Sinners_, and we are _righteous_, let us fear
nothing, nor be dismayed though the _Foundations_ of the Earth be
removed: But if our Consciences tell us, that we have sinned after
their Example, what Consolation is there to be had against the just
Expectation of suffering after their Example also?",26204,1600s

"1748. c. 31.] extended to the venial offence of going abroad by night, if the slave
was _notoriously_ guilty of it.--Such are the cruelties to which a state
of slavery gives birth; such the horrors to which the human mind is
capable of being reconciled, by its adoption. The dawn of humanity at
length appeared in the year 1769, when the power of dismembering, even
under the authority of a county court, was restricted to the single
offence of _attempting_ to ravish a white woman [1769. c. 19.",32239,1700s
"First, the doctrine of grace and of the righteousness of faith has been
obscured by it, which is the chief part of the Gospel, and ought to
stand out as the most prominent in the Church, in order that the merit
of Christ may be well known, and faith, which believes that sins are
forgiven for Christ's sake be exalted far above works. Wherefore Paul
also lays the greatest stress on this article, putting aside the Law
and human traditions, in order to show that Christian righteousness is
something else than such works, to wit, the faith which believes that
sins are freely forgiven for Christ's sake. But this doctrine of Paul
has been almost wholly smothered by traditions, which have produced an
opinion that, by making distinctions in meats and like services, we must
merit grace and righteousness. In treating of repentance, there was no
mention made of faith; only those works of satisfaction were set forth;
in these the entire repentance seemed to consist. Secondly, these traditions have obscured the commandments of God,
because traditions were placed far above the commandments of God.",275,1400s

composed of a twofold nature, a spiritual and a bodily. As regards the

repentance, and in repentance ought continually to increase; and in
these matters we place Christian and spiritual perfection, if
repentance and faith grow together in repentance. This can be better

also very much attached to him, but the King soon got tired of her. As
for Madame de Monaco, I would not take an oath that she never intrigued
with the King. While the King was fond of her, Lauzun, who had a regular

first time. He had forbidden his fair one to see the King; but finding
her one day sitting on the ground, and talking with His Majesty, Lauzun,
who, in his place as Captain of the guard, was in the chamber, was so
transported with jealousy that he could not restrain himself, and,
pretending to pass, he trod so violently on the hand which Madame de
Monaco had placed upon the ground, that he nearly crushed it. The King,

“‘Where is the stream?’ cried he, with tears. ‘Seest thou not its blue
waves above us?’ He looked up, and lo! the blue stream was flowing
gently over their heads.” —NOVALIS, _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_. While these strange events were passing through my mind, I suddenly, as
one awakes to the consciousness that the sea has been moaning by him
for hours, or that the storm has been howling about his window all
night, became aware of the sound of running water near me; and, looking
out of bed, I saw that a large green marble basin, in which I was wont
to wash, and which stood on a low pedestal of the same material in a
corner of my room, was overflowing like a spring; and that a stream of
clear water was running over the carpet, all the length of the room,
finding its outlet I knew not where. And, stranger still, where this
carpet, which I had myself designed to imitate a field of grass and
daisies, bordered the course of the little stream, the grass-blades and
daisies seemed to wave in a tiny breeze that followed the water’s flow;
while under the rivulet they bent and swayed with every motion of the
changeful current, as if they were about to dissolve with it, and,
forsaking their fixed form, become fluent as the waters.",325,1800s

"Palermo, April 10th, 1800. MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,

Reports are brought to me, that the Spanish ships of war in this port
are preparing to put to sea; a circumstance which must be productive
of very unpleasant consequences, to both England and this country. It is fully known, with what exactness I have adhered to the
neutrality of this port; for, upon our arrival here, from Naples, in
December 1798, from the conduct of his Catholic Majesty's minister, I
should have been fully justified in seizing those ships. We know, that one object of the Spanish fleet, combined with the
French, was to wrest entirely from the hands of his Sicilian Majesty
his kingdoms of the Two Sicilies. The Spaniards are, by bad councils, the tools of the French; and, of
course, the bitter enemy of his Sicilian Majesty and family.",15437,1700s

words that it may open.’

And the king answered: ‘What are the words? Shall I say something like
this: “Shut; shut; shut”?’

‘No,’ said he; ‘say “Open, Sartara Martara of the earth.”’

When the king had so said, the door opened of itself, and they went
in, while the king gnawed his moustache in anger. Then they came to the
second door, where the same thing happened as at the first, and they
went in and found the princess. Then spoke the king and said: ‘Yes, truly, you have found the princess. Now I will turn her as well as all her maidens into ducks, and if you
can guess which of these ducks is my daughter, then you shall have her
to wife.’

And immediately the king changed all the maidens into ducks, and he
drove them before the young man, and said: ‘Now show me which is my
daughter.’

Then the princess, according to their understanding, began to clean her
wings with her bill, and the lad said: ‘She who cleans her wings is the

Now the king could do nothing more but give her to the young man to
wife, and they lived together in great joy and happiness.",641,1800s

happier; and certainly one meets more old people in China than in
America. Since the United States of America is rich, well governed,

People terrified with their abominable Sins of Commission, fled from
their Cruelty, they were accused of Rebellion against the _Spanish_
King. This Tyrant made use of this Artifice, he commanded all that he
took, or that had bestowed Gold, Silver and other rich Gifts on him,
still to load him with other Presents, till he found they had exhausted
their Treasures, and were grown naked and incapable of affording him

amusement of mine, is that of shewing this maid and queen, in what
manner she may abound with provisions, by improving large tracts of
land, as well marshes, as barren sands, to great profit. A third
amusement, and an amusement too, without any alloy, is the shewing
how Venice, though already so strong as to be in a manner
impregnable, may be rendered still stronger; and, though extremely
beautiful, may still increase in beauty; though rich, may acquire
more wealth, and may be made to enjoy better air, though her air is

But the eyes and the ears of that loved one are closed,
And on her these rich treasures are lavished in vain. Unheeded by her the winter snow falls,
Its beautiful garment spring puts on in vain;
Many _summers_ the birds her sad requiem have sung,
But to sound of sweet music she'll ne'er wake again. There is _but one voice_ that deep slumber can break,

city's five hills; but the king's, in addition to being at the exact
center of Ammad, stood on the highest of them all. It could be seen from
the windows on the opposite side of Vokal's palace--the principal reason
his personal quarters were here. Sight of that huge sprawling pile of
white stone, its roof six levels above the ground, was a constant source

SECOND EDITION. *       *       *       *       *

In preparing a Second Edition of the following treatise, the author has
endeavoured to avail himself of every assistance in his power, from books,
observation, and the communications of some literary friends, to whom he is
indebted for several judicious remarks. In comparing the opinions of
different critics, it was not to be expected that all should be found to
agree together. It sometimes happened that one approved what another would
have rejected.",28766,1700s

whisked his long tail and in an instant had slid down the rocks and
made a dive through the entrance. Along the passage he swept, nearly filling it with his immense body,
and now he poked his head into the jeweled cavern of Ruggedo.",956,1800s
"This, amongst other circumstances treated more at large by Ségrais,
agrees with the rising of Orion, which caused the tempest described in
the beginning of the First Book. By some passages in the ""Pastorals,""
but more particularly in the ""Georgics,"" our poet is found to be an
exact astronomer, according to the knowledge of that age. Now Ilioneus
(whom Virgil twice employs in embassies, as the best speaker of the
Trojans) attributes that tempest to Orion, in his speech to Dido:

  _Cum, subito assurgens fluctu, nimbosus Orion_--

He must mean either the heliacal, or achronical rising of that sign. The heliacal rising of a constellation is, when it comes from under the
rays of the sun, and begins to appear before day-light; the achronical
rising, on the contrary, is when it appears at the close of day, and in
opposition to the sun's diurnal course. The heliacal rising of Orion is at present computed to be about the
sixth of July; and about that time it is, that he either causes or
presages tempests on the seas.",64337,1600s

"It was indeed a strange chamber
to feast in; and we could not help remarking on the cold, ghastly
appearance of the walls, and the black water at our side, with the thick
darkness beyond, and the sullen sound of the drops that fell at long
intervals from the roof of the cavern into the still water; and the
strong contrast between all this and our bed and supper, which, with our
faces, were lit up with the deep red flame of the torch. We sat long over our meal, talking together in subdued voices, for we did
not like the dismal echoes that rang through the vault above when we
happened to raise them. At last the faint light that came through the
opening died away, warning us that it was night and time for rest. We
therefore put out our torch and lay down to sleep. On awaking, it was some time ere we could collect our faculties so as to
remember where we were, and we were in much uncertainty as to whether it
was early or late.",646,1800s
"said I to
myself, 'this will never do.' So up I walked to the captain, and
touching my hat, reminded him that 'I had a father and mother, and a
pretty sprinkling of brothers and sisters, who were dying to see me, and
that I hoped that he would give me leave.' 'Ax the first lieutenant,'
said he, turning away. 'I have, sir,' replied I, 'and he says that the
devil a bit shall I put my foot on shore.' 'Then you have misbehaved
yourself,' said the captain.",13148,1700s
"55. The magnitude of the object which exists without the mind, and is at
a distance, continues always invariably the same: but the visible object
still changing as you approach to, or recede from, the tangible object,
it hath no fixed and determinate greatness. Whenever, therefore, we speak
of the magnitude of anything, for instance a tree or a house, we must
mean the tangible magnitude, otherwise there can be nothing steady and
free from ambiguity spoken of it. But though the tangible and visible
magnitude in truth belong to two distinct objects: I shall nevertheless
(especially since those objects are called by the same name, and are
observed to coexist), to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech,
sometimes speak of them as belonging to one and the same thing. 56.",4722,1600s
"The tax on tea, which is the tax here alluded to, was neither more or
less than an experiment to establish the practice of a declaratory law
upon; modelled into the more fashionable phrase _of the universal
supremacy of Parliament_. For until this time the declaratory law had
lain dormant, and the framers of it had contented themselves with
barely declaring an opinion. Therefore the _whole_ question with America, in the opening of the
dispute, was, Shall we be bound in all cases whatsoever by the British
Parliament, or shall we not? For submission to the tea or tax act,
implied an acknowledgment of the declaratory act, or, in other words,
of the universal supremacy of Parliament, which as they never intended
to do, it was necessary they should oppose it, in its first stage of
execution. It is probable, the Abbe has been led into this mistake by perusing
detached pieces in some of the American newspapers; for, in a case
where all were interested, everyone had a right to give his opinion;
and there were many who, with the best intentions, did not chuse the
best, nor indeed the true ground, to defend their cause upon.",15279,1700s

with such violent convulsive Motions as were very surprizing; during
which he expired. The Body being laid on a Table to be dissected, all
it’s Parts appeared so prodigiously inflated, that the Person, when a
live, being one of the largest Stature, it seemed perfectly monstrous. A Puncture being made in any Part through the Integuments, there was
nothing discharged but a subtile Matter or Air; immediately after which
the Part subsided, though before on a Compressure of the Fingers it
would receive such an Impression as is observed in Oedematous Tumours;
but it would suddenly return to it’s former State. The Surface of
several of the Parts appeared livid and vesicated.",52993,1600s
"No funeral, of which you ever heard,

  Afflicting him with mulligrubs and cholick. He also had imbibe'd, to sooth his pains,
  Of _pulvis rhei_ very many grains;

  To give, quite privily, his sorrows vent:

at this resistance, fell on the hostages and massacred them. [Sidenote: War with the southern Indians.]",18591,1700s

State of the Union Address
John Adams
November 22, 1797

Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:

I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account of
the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia, to
convene the National Legislature at some other place. This measure it was
desirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience and
a considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants
of this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their
fellow citizens. Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the state
and decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,
now happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or health of the
members, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by law to
meet. I submit, however, to your consideration whether a power to postpone
the meeting of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitution
upon such occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.",5011,1700s
"Clarke crossed the river, with nine men and a large part of the
merchandise, to purchase, if possible, twelve horses to transport our
baggage, and some pounded fish, as a reserve, on the passage across the
mountains. He succeeded in purchasing only four horses, and those at
double the price that had been paid to the Shoshonees. April 20.--As it was much for our interest to preserve the good will of
these people, we passed over several small thefts which they had
committed; but this morning we learned that six tomahawks and a knife
had been stolen during the night. We addressed ourselves to the chief,
who seemed angry with his people; but we did not recover the articles:
and soon afterwards two of our spoons were missing. We therefore ordered
them all from the camp.",38774,1700s
"[119] Thou hast made him _Bishop of our souls_,[120]
but there are others bishops too. He gave the Holy Ghost,[121] and
others gave it also. Thy way, O my God (and, O my God, thou lovest to
walk in thine own ways, for they are large), thy way from the beginning,
is multiplication of thy helps; and therefore it were a degree of
ingratitude not to accept this mercy of affording me many helps for my
bodily health, as a type and earnest of thy gracious purpose now and
ever to afford me the same assistances. That for thy great help, thy
word, I may seek that not from comers nor conventicles nor schismatical
singularities, but from the association and communion of thy Catholic
church, and those persons whom thou hast always furnished that church
withal: and that I may associate thy word with thy sacrament, thy seal
with thy patent; and in that sacrament associate the sign with the thing
signified, the bread with the body of thy Son, so as I may be sure to
have received both, and to be made thereby (as thy blessed servant
Augustine says) the ark, and the monument, and the tomb of thy most
blessed Son, that he, and all the merits of his death, may, by that
receiving, be buried in me, to my quickening in this world, and my
immortal establishing in the next. VII.",23772,1500s

"Sunset Amphitheater (fig. 11) is
part of the large scar left by them. About 2,800 years ago one of these
avalanches created a mudflow in the valleys of the South Puyallup River
and Tahoma Creek that was temporarily deep enough to submerge Round Pass
(on the West Side Road) to a depth of nearly 400 feet. This is
especially remarkable when we see that Round Pass itself is 600-700 feet
above the nearby valley floors. Another deep mudflow, started by an
avalanche at Sunset Amphitheater, moved down the Puyallup River valley
about 600 years ago and buried the site of the present town of Orting in

"I, on the contrary, am convinced
that he will not stir; it is in my opinion impossible. Lambert leads an
army devoid of homogeneous principles, and there is no possible army
with such elements. I have taught my soldiers to consider my authority
subordinate to another, therefore after me, round me, and beneath me
they still look for something. It would result that if I were dead,
whatever might happen, my army would not be demoralized all at once; it
results, that if I choose to absent myself, for instance, as it does
please me to do sometimes, there would not be in the camp the shadow of
uneasiness or disorder. I am the magnet—the sympathetic and natural

"But to giue you a direct Answer to the matter of warre, for which
you are so earnest, VVe confeße VVee rather expected that you should
haue giuen Vs great and hartie thanks for the so long maintaining a
setled peace in all Our Dominions, when as all Our Neighbours about
are in a miserable combustion of warre; but_ Dulce bellum inexpertis;
_and We indeed find by experience, that a number of Our Subiects are so
pampered with peace, as they are desirous of change, though they know
not what. It is true that We haue euer professed, and in that minde,
with Gods grace, Wee meane to liue and die, That We will labour by all
meanes poßible, either by treaty, or by force to restore Our Children
to their ancient Dignities and Inheritances; and whatsoeuer Christian
Princes or Potentates will set themselues against it, Wee will not
spare any lawfull meanes to bring Our so iust and Honourable purpose to
a good end; neither shall the Match of Our Sonne, or any other worldly
respect be preferred to this Our Resolution: For by Our credit, and
interuention with the King of Spaine, and the Arch–dutcheße, and her
Husband now with God, Wee preserued the lower_ Palatinat _one whole
yeere from any further conquering in it, which within any eight dayes
space in that time might haue easily been swallowed vp by_ Spinolaes
_Armie, without any resistance; and in no better case was it now, at
Our Ambassadour, the Lord_ Digbies _comming through_ Heydleberg, _if
he had not extraordinarily succoured it. But because Wee perceiue that
ye couple this warre of the_ Palatinate _with the cause of Religion,
We must a little vnfold your eyes herein. The beginning of this
miserable warre, which hath set all Christendome on fire, was not for
Religion; but onely caused by Our Sonne in law his hastie and rash
Resolution, following euill counsell, to take to himselfe the Crowne
of_ Bohemia: _And that this is true, himselfe wrote Letters vnto Vs
at that time, desiring Vs to giue aßurance, both to the French King,
and State of_ Venice, _that his accepting of the Crowne of_ Bohemia
_had no reference to the cause of Religion, but onely by reason of
his right by Election (as hee called it:) And we would be sorrie that
that aspersion should come vpon Our Religion, as to make it a good
pretext for dethroning of Kings, and vsurping their Crownes. And Wee
would bee loath that Our people here should be taught that doctrine:
No, let vs not so farre wrong the Iesuits, as to rob them of their
sweet Positions and practise in that point.",47413,1500s

And now I come as poor as Holy Christ
Who had no place to rest His weary head --
My wealth is gone; I offered it to him
Who sent me here; he sent me speedy word
""Give all unto the poor in quiet way --
And hide the giving -- ere you give yourself
To God!"" `Wilt take me now for my own sake? I bring my soul -- 'tis little worth I ween,

  To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears. Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
  And as a bed I'll take them, and there lie;

but who are polluted on account of weakness. Concerning this entire
topic enough has been said above, in regard to which indeed it is
strange, since the dangers and scandals are occurring before men's
eyes that the adversaries still defend their traditions contrary to
the manifest command of God. Neither does the voice of Christ move
them, who chides the Pharisees, Matt.",6744,1400s

The werewolf also appears in North America, duly furnished with his
wolf-skin sack; but neither in America nor in Africa is he the genuine
European werewolf, inspired by a diabolic frenzy, and ravening for human
flesh. The barbaric myths testify to the belief that men can be changed
into beasts or have in some cases descended from beast ancestors, but
the application of this belief to the explanation of abnormal cannibal
cravings seems to have been confined to Europe. The werewolf of
the Middle Ages was not merely a transformed man,--he was an insane
cannibal, whose monstrous appetite, due to the machinations of the
Devil, showed its power over his physical organism by changing the shape
of it. The barbaric werewolf is the product of a lower and simpler kind
of thinking. There is no diabolism about him; for barbaric races, while
believing in the existence of hurtful and malicious fiends, have not a
sufficiently vivid sense of moral abnormity to form the conception of
diabolism.",1061,1800s

"Whereupon exile Hakon, Jarl Sigurd's son, bestirs himself in Denmark,
backed by old King Blue-tooth, and begins invading and encroaching in a
miscellaneous way; especially intriguing and contriving plots all round
him. An unfathomably cunning kind of fellow, as well as an audacious and
strong-handed! Intriguing in Trondhjem, where he gets the under-king,
Greyfell's brother, fallen upon and murdered; intriguing with Gold
Harald, a distinguished cousin or nephew of King Blue-tooth's, who had
done fine viking work, and gained, such wealth that he got the
epithet of ""Gold,"" and who now was infinitely desirous of a share in
Blue-tooth's kingdom as the proper finish to these sea-rovings. He even
ventured one day to make publicly a distinct proposal that way to King
Harald Blue-tooth himself; who flew into thunder and lightning at the
mere mention of it; so that none durst speak to him for several days
afterwards. Of both these Haralds Hakon was confidential friend; and
needed all his skill to walk without immediate annihilation between such

"A young man belonging to
this Inn had disappeared eight weeks before (it was winter-time), and was
supposed to have had some undiscovered love affair, and to have gone for
a soldier. He had got up in the night, and dropped into the village
street from the loft in which he slept with another man; and he had done
it so quietly, that his companion and fellow-labourer had heard no
movement when he was awakened in the morning, and they said, ""Louis,
where is Henri?"" They looked for him high and low, in vain, and gave him
up. Now, outside this Inn, there stood, as there stood outside every
dwelling in the village, a stack of firewood; but the stack belonging to
the Inn was higher than any of the rest, because the Inn was the richest
house, and burnt the most fuel. It began to be noticed, while they were
looking high and low, that a Bantam cock, part of the live stock of the
Inn, put himself wonderfully out of his way to get to the top of this
wood-stack; and that he would stay there for hours and hours, crowing,
until he appeared in danger of splitting himself.",1394,1800s

"We, therefore, will add
testimonies which clearly declare that faith is that very
righteousness by which we are accounted righteous before God, namely,
not because it is a work that is in itself worthy, but because it
receives the promise by which God has promised that for Christ's sake
He wishes to be propitious to those believing in Him, or because He
knows that Christ of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,
and sanctification, and redemption, 1 Cor. 1, 30. In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul discusses this topic especially,
and declares that, when we believe that God, for Christ's sake is
reconciled to us, we are justified freely by faith. And this
proposition, which contains the statement of the entire discussion

"In this region, in the month
of June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said,
indeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics
of an American watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a
vision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither
and thither of “stylish” young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces,
a rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched
voices at all times. You receive an impression of these things at the
excellent inn of the “Trois Couronnes” and are transported in fancy to
the Ocean House or to Congress Hall. But at the “Trois Couronnes,” it
must be added, there are other features that are much at variance with
these suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of
legation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys
walking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the
sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle
of Chillon.",208,1800s
"He also against the house of God was bold:
A leper once he lost, and gained a king—
Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew
God’s altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
His odious offerings, and adore the gods
Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared
A crew who, under names of old renown—
Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train—
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape
Th’ infection, when their borrowed gold composed
The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox—
Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
Both her first-born and all her bleating gods. Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars, when the priest
Turns atheist, as did Eli’s sons, who filled
With lust and violence the house of God?",26,1600s
"At the close of the month of May it was a matter of general
observation, and, of course, of general regret, how few symptoms
of thawing had yet appeared, either on shore or on the ice. Naturally pursuing our usual comparison with the circumstances of
the former winter passed in these regions, it was impossible not
to recollect that Melville Island had, on the same day two years
before, advanced full as far as the country now before us in
throwing off its winter covering. The parts of the land which were
now the most bare were the smooth round tops of the hills, on
which here and there occurred a little pool of water, from which,
taking all together within half a mile round the ships, we should
at this time have had great difficulty in filling half a tun. There were also on the lower lands, a few dark uncovered patches,
looking, when viewed from the hills, like islets in an extensive
sea. Vegetation seemed labouring to commence, and a few tufts of
the _saxifraga oppositifolia_, when closely examined, discovered
some signs of life.",13512,1700s

possible that a heart or conscience can obtain rest, or hope for
salvation, when in afflictions and in the anguish of death our works
in the judgment and sight of God utterly become dust, unless it
becomes certain by faith that men are saved by mercy, for Christ's
sake, and not for the sake of their works, their fulfilling of the
Law? And, indeed, St. Laurentius, when placed on the gridiron, and
being tortured for Christ's sake did not think that by this work he
was perfectly and absolutely fulfilling the Law, that he was without
sin, that he did not need Christ as Mediator and the mercy of God. He rested his case, indeed, with the prophet, who says: Enter not
into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living
be justified, Ps. 143, 2. Nor did St. Bernard boast that his works
were worthy of eternal life, when he says: _Perdite vixi_, I have led
a sinful life, etc.",6744,1400s

common to either. Nevertheless, being advised not to push matters too
far, he read a lecture to his son, and made him change his conduct by
degrees. But Monsieur still remained irritated against the King; and
this completely upset him, accustomed as he always had been to live on
the best of terms with his brother, and to be treated by him in every
respect as such--except that the King would not allow Monsieur to become
a great personage. Ordinarily, whenever Monsieur or Madame were unwell, even if their little
finger ached, the King visited them at once; and continued his visits if
the sickness lasted. But now, Madame had been laid up for six weeks with

hill, that they might also attack the place on that side. Jacopo
Guicciardini was commissary of the army; and while the siege of Pietra
Santa was going on, the Genoese took and burned the fortress of Vada,
and, landing their forces, plundered the surrounding country. Biongianni
Gianfigliazzi was sent against them, with a body of horse and foot, and
checked their audacity, so that they pursued their depredations less
boldly. The fleet continuing its efforts went to Livorno, and by
pontoons and other means approached the new tower, playing their

purpose, and many Debates made at _Valedolid_ about this weighty
Affair, at length by the unanimous Consent and Advice of all those who
had committed their Opinions to Writing, they were made publick who
traced more closely therein the Laws of Christ and Christianity, and
were judged Persons pure, free from and innocent of that stain and
blemish of depriving the _Indians_ of their Treasures by Theft and
Rapine, which Riches had contaminated and sullied the Hands, but much
more the Souls of those who were enslav'd by those heaps of Wealth and
Covetousness, now this obstinate and hot pursuit after Wealth was the
Original of all those Evils committed without the least Remorse or
Check of Conscience. These Laws being thus promulgated, the _Courtiers_ who promoted these
Tyrants, took care that several Copies should be transcribed, (though
they were extremely afflicted to see, that there was no farther hopes
or means to promote the former Depredations and Extortions by the
Tyranny aforesaid) and sent them to several _Indian_ Provinces. They,

perused these Diplomata or Constitutions, before the new made Judges,
appointed to put them in Execution, could Arrive or be Landed, they by
the assistance of those (as 'tis credibly rumour'd, nor is it repugnant

knowing well that these Laws and Proclamations must necessarily take
effect, began to grow mutinous, and rebel, and when the Judges were
Landed, who were to Execute these _Mandates_, laying aside all manner
of Love and Fear of God, were so audacious as to contemn and set at
nought all the Reverence and Obedience due to their King, and so became
Traytors, demeaning themselves like Blood-Thirsty Tyrants, destitute
and void of all Humanity. More particularly this appear'd in the _Perusian_ Kingdoms, where _An. Dom._ 1542, they acted such Horrid and Stupendous Enormities, that the
like were never known or heard in _America_, or throughout the whole

occasioned new troubles. It was his common practice to be of a contrary
opinion to the most powerful men in the city; and whatever he saw the

not know or would not divulge. But the fact that he had permitted sentiment to stay his hand when
he might so easily have put Bertha Kircher out of the way in the
hotel at Wilhelmstal that night rankled in the ape-man's bosom. He was shamed by his weakness, and when he had handed the paper
she had given him to the British chief of staff, even though
the information it contained permitted the British to frustrate a
German flank attack, he was still much dissatisfied with himself. And possibly the root of this dissatisfaction lay in the fact that
he realized that were he again to have the same opportunity he
would still find it as impossible to slay a woman as it had been
in Wilhelmstal that night. Tarzan blamed this weakness, as he considered it, upon his association
with the effeminizing influences of civilization, for in the bottom

the bitterness of party spirit, instead of being abated, increased. Although the friends of Cosmo had been in favor of it, many of the
adverse faction were sent to assist in the management, as being men of
greater influence in the state. Averardo de' Medici and the rest being
unable to prevent this, endeavored with all their might to calumniate
them; and when any unfavorable circumstance occurred (and there were
many), fortune and the exertions of the enemy were never supposed to
be the causes, but solely the want of capacity in the commissary. This
disposition aggravated the offenses of Astorre Gianni; this excited the
indignation of Rinaldo degli Albizzi, and made him resign his commission
without leave; this, too, compelled the captain of the people to require
the appearance of Giovanni Guicciardini, and from this arose all
the other charges which were made against the magistrates and the
commissaries. Real evils were magnified, unreal ones feigned, and the
true and the false were equally believed by the people, who were almost
universally their foes.",2464,1400s

along the edge of the ice, without seeing any opening, and had
therefore no prospect of advancing farther north.--Until the 27th,
however, they continued to seek a passage, first on the American, and

"Where no internal lesions have occurred, there is every
reason to believe that such measures might produce restoration. My imperfect machines gave me to see how much might be done for this
important part of physiology by a more perfect apparatus. Mine was
merely horizontal--but one might be made to take as many positions as
are natural to the human frame; and how many facts might such an one
elicit concerning the effects of position on the circulation, by which
lives might every day be saved! But skilful mechanicians, not ordinary
mechanics, are needed, who are men of intellectual capacity, and are
furnished with _carte-blanche_ for time and expense. [3]

fruitless efforts to get before the public the theory, of whose truth

cheerfully than some of his comrades. But Giacomo was more delicate, and
less able to bear want and fatigue. His livelier comrade cheered him up,

Commandment, since it is impossible to worship God without ascribing to
Him the glory of truth and of universal goodness, as it ought in truth
to be ascribed. Now this is not done by works, but only by faith of
heart. It is not by working, but by believing, that we glorify God, and
confess Him to be true. On this ground faith alone is the righteousness

"Hence the
besiegers were more distressed than the people of Martinengo whom they
besieged. The count could not hold his position for want of food, nor
quit it without imminent danger; so that the duke's victory appeared
certain, and defeat equally inevitable to the count and the Venetians. But fortune, never destitute of means to assist her favorites, or to
injure others, caused the hope of victory to operate so powerfully
upon Niccolo Piccinino, and made him assume such a tone of unbounded
insolence, that, losing all respect for himself and the duke, he sent
him word that, having served under his ensign for so long, without
obtaining sufficient land to serve him for a grave, he wished to know
from himself what was to be the reward of his labors; for it was in his
power to make him master of Lombardy, and place all his enemies in
his power; and, as a certain victory ought to be attended by a sure
remuneration, he desired the duke to concede to him the city of
Piacenza, that when weary with his lengthened services he might at
last betake himself to repose. Nor did he hesitate, in conclusion, to
threaten, if his request were not granted, to abandon the enterprise. This injurious and most insolent mode of proceeding highly offended the
duke, and, on further consideration, he determined rather to let the
expedition altogether fail, than consent to his general's demand.",2464,1400s

Then suddenly the pit, the Devil Crystals, and everything else in

Evanion, who introduced me to a throng of fascinating characters, with
each of whom he seemed almost as familiar as if they had been daily
companions. Subsequently I discovered an old engraving of Chabert, published in
London in 1829, and later still another which bore the change of name,
as well as the titles enumerated above. The latter was published in New
York, September, 1836, and bore the inscription:  ""One of the most

Letter Seventeenth To Anne Boleyn


The reasonable request of your last letter, with the pleasure also that I
take to know them true, causeth me to send you these news. The legate
which we most desire arrived at Paris on Sunday or Monday last past, so
that I trust by the next Monday to hear of his arrival at Calais: and then
I trust within a while after to enjoy that which I have so long longed
for, to God's pleasure and our both comforts. No more to you at this present, mine own darling, for lack of time, but
that I would you were in mine arms, or I in yours, for I think it long
since I kissed you. Written after the killing of a hart, at eleven of the clock, minding, with
God's grace, to-morrow, mightily timely, to kill another, by the hand
which, I trust, shortly shall be yours.",32155,1400s

many blessings be not to our
condemnation; except we shall
walk worthy of him, doing with
one consent what is good and
pleasing in his sight. 2  The spirit of the Lord is a
candle, searching out the inward
parts of the belly. 3  Let us therefore consider how
near he is to us; and how that
none of our thoughts, or reasonings
which we frame within ourselves,
are hid from him,

4  It is therefore just that we
should not forsake our rank, by
doing contrary to his will. 5  Let us choose to offend a few
foolish and inconsiderate men,
lifted up and glorying in their
own pride, rather than God. 6  Let us reverence our Lord
Jesus Christ whose blood was
given for us.",6512,1600s
"[I myself have heard
a great preacher who did not mention Christ and the Gospel, and

way to preach to Christians?] Nor did such men err if those things
are true which the adversaries defend [if the doctrine of the
adversaries be true, the Ethics is a precious book of sermons, and a
fine new Bible]. For Aristotle wrote concerning civil morals so
learnedly that nothing further concerning this need be demanded. We
see books extant in which certain sayings of Christ are compared with
the sayings of Socrates, Zeno, and others, as though Christ had come
for the purpose of delivering certain laws through which we might
merit the remission of sins, as though we did not receive this
gratuitously, because of His merits.",6744,1400s

"This last
ebullition, which might well have passed for fanaticism in a later day,
and given a visionary tinge to his whole project, was not quite so
preposterous in an age, in which the spirit of the crusades might be said
still to linger, and the romance of religion had not yet been dispelled by
sober reason. The more temperate suggestion of the diffusion of the gospel
was well suited to affect Isabella, in whose heart the principle of
devotion was deeply seated, and who, in all her undertakings, seems to
have been far less sensible to the vulgar impulses of avarice or ambition,
than to any argument connected, however remotely, with the interests of
religion. [21]

Amidst all these propitious demonstrations towards Columbus, an obstacle
unexpectedly arose in the nature of his demands, which stipulated for
himself and heirs the title and authority of Admiral and Viceroy over all
lands discovered by him, with one-tenth of the profits. This was deemed
wholly inadmissible. Ferdinand, who had looked with cold distrust on the
expedition from the first, was supported by the remonstrances of Talavera,
the new archbishop of Granada; who declared, that ""such demands savored of
the highest degree of arrogance, and would be unbecoming in their
Highnesses to grant to a needy foreign adventurer.""",6967,1700s

  And knock it out of the back of your head. “There isn't a turkey or goose or swan,
  Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks,

  You turn your duck into the lucerne patch,
  And I'd be ready to make a match
  That the grasshoppers eats his feathers off!' “He came to visit us by and by,
  And it just so happened one day in Spring
  A kind of a cloud came over the sky--

"The lowest people eat in a filthy manner, putting their dirty hands into
the dish, and thrusting their food by handfuls into their mouths. The
punishment of murder is by impalement; but those who wound or hurt any
one have to pay a fine to the king. When any one is in debt, and refuses
to pay, the creditor goes to the judges, of whom there are said to be a
hundred, and having made due proof of the debt, he receives a certain
stick or branch of a tree, with authority to arrest his debtor, to whom,
when he is able to find him, he uses these words: ""I charge you by the
heads of the Bramins, and by the head of the king, that you stir not
from the spot on which you stand till you pay me what you owe."" The
debtor has now no resource but to pay immediately, or to lose his life:
for, if he escape after this ceremony, he is adjudged a rebel, and it is
lawful for any man to kill him. When they mean to pray to their idols, they resort before sunrise to
some pool or rivet where they wash themselves, after which they resort
to the idol-house, taking especial care not to touch any thing by the
way, and say their prayers prostrate on the ground, making strange
gesticulations and contortions, so marvellously distorting their faces,
eyes, and mouths, that it is horrible to behold.",13287,1700s

and in order the rest. Now they who by reason of the scantiness of
room in the hut, cannot be admitted to the feast, such are boies and
girles, climb up to the roof of the hut, and from thence let down

tall conical gold miter, and a bright blue false beard, forked like

the kind, and numbered among its associates men much more distinguished

English Society. Yet this famous body gave a poetical prize, for which
Voltaire was a candidate, to a fellow who wrote some verses about THE

that old English coins, a brass gun, a powder horn and a small
quarter-deck gun made of iron staves and hooped with iron had been found
on the site. An act of 1723 regarding a proposed town on Roanoke Island speaks of
“300 Acres of Land lying on the No. E’t side of the said Island,
commonly called Roanoke old plantation,” thus suggesting that at that
date the northeastern part of the island was regarded as the scene of
Raleigh’s settlements. The earliest known map to show Fort Raleigh is the Collet map of 1770,

"A CLIENT FOR PAUL HARLEY

Some of Paul Harley’s most interesting cases were brought to his notice
in an almost accidental way. Although he closed his office in Chancery
Lane sharply at the hour of six, the hour of six by no means marked the
end of his business day. His work was practically ceaseless. But even in
times of leisure, at the club or theatre, fate would sometimes cast in
his path the first slender thread which was ultimately to lead him into
some unsuspected labyrinth, perhaps in the underworld of London, perhaps
in a city of the Far East. His investigation of the case of the man with the shaven skull afforded
an instance of this, and even more notable was his first meeting with
Major Jack Ragstaff of the Cavalry Club, a meeting which took place
after the office had been closed, but which led to the unmasking of
perhaps the most cunning murderer in the annals of crime.",1159,1800s

the combatants still higher by emulation. So it happened even now that
Heimbert and Fadrique were commanded to storm the very same height,
which, now gleaming with the morning light, they at once recognized
as that which had shone out so fiercely and full of promise the night
before. CHAPTER VI. Thrice had Fadrique and Heimbert almost forced their way to a rampart
in the fortifications, and thrice had they been repulsed with their
men into the valley below by the fierce opposition of the Turks. The
Mussulmans shouted after the retreating foe, clashed their weapons with
the triumph of victory, and with a scornful laugh asked whether they
would not come up again to give heart and brain to the scimitar and
their limbs to the falling beams of wood.",2826,1700s
"Shortly after this event, another occurred of greater importance. The
Florentines were, as we have before remarked, at war with the duke of
Milan, who, finding that with merely open force he could not overcome
them, had recourse to secret practices, and with the assistance of the
exiles of whom Lombardy was full, he formed a plot to which many in the
city were accessory. It was resolved by the conspirators that most of
the emigrants, capable of bearing arms, should set out from the places
nearest Florence, enter the city by the river Arno, and with their
friends hasten to the residences of the chiefs of the government; and
having slain them, reform the republic according to their own will. Of
the conspirators within the city, was one of the Ricci named Samminiato;
and as it often happens in treacherous practices, few are insufficient
to effect the purpose of the plot, and among many secrecy cannot be
preserved, so while Samminiato was in quest of associates, he found an
accuser. He confided the affair to Salvestro Cavicciulli, whose wrongs
and those of his friends were thought sufficient to make him faithful;
but he, more influenced by immediate fear than the hope of future
vengeance, discovered the whole affair to the Signory, who, having
caused Samminiato to be taken, compelled him to tell all the particulars
of the matter.",2464,1400s

Solomon Macey, a small hale old man with an abundant crop of long white
hair reaching nearly to his shoulders, advanced to the indicated spot,
bowing reverently while he fiddled, as much as to say that he respected
the company, though he respected the key-note more. As soon as he had
repeated the tune and lowered his fiddle, he bowed again to the Squire

well, and wishing you health and long life and a happy New Year. And
wishing the same to you, Mr. Lammeter, sir; and to the other gentlemen,
and the madams, and the young lasses.”

As Solomon uttered the last words, he bowed in all directions

imagined that they were too far involved not to push matters to extremity. To terrify the enemies of the revolution, to excite the fanaticism of the
people by harangues, by the presence of danger, and by insurrections; to
refer everything to it, both the government and the safety of the
republic; to infuse into it the most ardent enthusiasm, in the name of
liberty, equality, and fraternity; to keep it in this violent state of
crisis for the purpose of making use of its passions and its power; such
was the plan of Danton and the Mountain, who had chosen him for their

dangers of the republic, and who, under the name of revolutionary
government, established the despotism of the multitude, instead of legal

or Seventy, arriv'd at _Trinity-Island_, which exceeds _Sicile_, both
in Amplitude and Fertility, and is contiguous to the Continent on that
side where it toucheth upon _Paria_, whose Inhabitants, according to
their Quality, are more addicted to Probity and Vertue, than the rest
of the _Indians_; who immediately published an Edict, that all the
Inhabitants should come and cohabit with them. The _Indian_ Lords and
Subjects gave them a Debonair and Brotherly Reception, serving them
with wonderful Alacrity, furnishing them with dayly Provisions in so
plentiful a manner, that they might have sufficed a more numerous
Company; for it is the Mode among _Indians_ of this New World, to
supply the _Spaniards_ very bountifuly with all manner of Necessaries. A short time after the _Spaniards_ built a stately House, which was an
Appartment for the _Indians_, that they might accomplish their
praemeditated Designs, which was thus effected. When they were to
thatch it, and had rais'd it two Mens height, they inclos'd several of
them there, to expedite the Work, as they pretended, but in truth that
they who were within, might not see those without; thus part of them
surrounded the House with Sword in Hand that no one should stir out,
and part of them entred it, and bound the _Indians_, menacing them with
Death, if they offered to move a Foot; and if any one endeavoured to
escape, he was presently hackt in pieces; but some of them partly

"They who know what strange Attractions and Combinations are made by
volatile Spirits will understand this Reasoning; especially if they
consider, how easily all kinds of _Effluvia_ are diffused in a warm Air,
such as we have described an Infectious one to be; and further, of how
penetrating a Force the finest Parts of Animal Juices are; of which the
strange Stench of a mortified Limb, upon a Body yet living, will
convince any one. A corrupted State of Air is without doubt necessary to give these
_Contagious Atoms_ their full Force; for otherwise it were not easy to
conceive how the _Plague_, when once it had seized any Place, should
ever cease, but with the Destruction of all the Inhabitants: Which is
readily accounted for by supposing an Emendation of the Qualities of the
Air, and the restoring of it to a healthy State capable of dissipating
and suppressing the Malignity. On the other hand it is evident, that _Infection_ is not received from
the Air it self, however predisposed, without the Concurrence of
something emitted from _Infected_ Persons; because, by strictly
preventing all Intercourse of Infected Places with the Neighbourhood, it
may be effectually kept from spreading: Whereas the least Wind must
necessarily convey whatever noxious Quality resides in the Air alone,
even to a great Distance. Of this we have had a fresh Proof in the
present unhappy _Plague_ in _France_, which, by keeping careful Guard,
was confined for a considerable Time within the Walls of _Marseilles_;
so that none of the adjacent Villages suffered any thing by it; till at
length some Persons finding Means to escape carried the Infection along

restrain it within moderate Bounds.",54843,1600s

are true which the adversaries defend [if the doctrine of the

learnedly that nothing further concerning this need be demanded. We
see books extant in which certain sayings of Christ are compared with
the sayings of Socrates, Zeno, and others, as though Christ had come
for the purpose of delivering certain laws through which we might
merit the remission of sins, as though we did not receive this
gratuitously, because of His merits. Therefore, if we here receive
the doctrine of the adversaries, that by the works of reason we merit
the remission of sins and justification, there will be no difference
between philosophic, or certainly pharisaic, and Christian
righteousness. Although the adversaries, not to pass by Christ altogether, require a
knowledge of the history concerning Christ, and ascribe to Him that
it is His merit that a habit is given us, or, as they say, _prima
gratia_, ""first grace,"" which they understand as a habit, inclining
us the more readily to love God; yet what they ascribe to this habit
is of little importance [is a feeble, paltry, small, poor operation,
that would be ascribed to Christ], because they imagine that the acts
of the will are of the same kind before and after this habit.",6744,1400s

"The company, I think, increased,
and our entertainment was not only hospitable, but elegant. At night, a
minister's sister, in very fine brocade, sung Erse songs; I wished to
know the meaning; but the highlanders are not much used to scholastick
questions, and no translations could be obtained. Next day, Sept. 8th, the weather allowed us to depart; a good boat was
provided us, and we went to Raarsa, under the conduct of Mr. Malcolm
Macleod, a gentleman who conducted prince Charles through the mountains
in his distresses. The prince, he says, was more active than himself;
they were, at least, one night without any shelter. The wind blew enough to give the boat a kind of dancing agitation, and,
in about three or four hours, we arrived at Raarsa, where we were met by
the laird, and his friends, upon the shore.",10835,1700s

"Besides other things this
friar is said to have collected by his industry all the labour and
materials required for the church. It was completed when fra Jacopo
Passavanti was prior of the convent, who thus deserved his marble
tomb which is on the left hand side in front of the principal chapel. The church was consecrated by Pope Martin V. in the year 1470, as
appears by an inscription on marble on a pillar on the right of the
principal chapel, which runs:

   Anno Domini 1420 die Septembris, Dominus Martinus divina
   providentia Papa V personaliter hanc ecclesiam consecravit, et
   magnas indulgentias contulit visitantibus eamdem. All these things and many more are related in a chronicle of the
building of this church, which is in the possession of the fathers of
S. Maria Novella, as well as in the history of Giovanni Villani. I
did not wish to omit these few particulars, because the church is one
of the finest and most important in Florence, and also because it
contains many excellent works of the most famous artists of a later
time, as will be related hereafter.",21212,1500s
"On a low branch he squatted above the trail. For an hour he waited. It
was growing dark. A little to one side of the ford in the densest
thicket he heard the faint sound of padded feet, and the brushing of a
huge body against tall grasses and tangled creepers. None other than
Tarzan might have heard it, but the ape-man heard and translated—it was
Numa, the lion, on the same errand as himself.",81,1800s
"These Men deserted these Regions, leaving them in
great distraction and confusion, nor were they branded with less notes
of infamy, by the certain Slaughters they perpetrated, though they were
but few in number than the rest. For the Just God cut them off before
they did much Mischief, and reserv'd the Castigation and Revenge of
those Evils which I know, and was an Eye-Witness of, to this very Time
and Place. As to the Fourth Tyrant, who lately, that is, in the Year
1538, came hither well-furnished with Men and Ammunition, we have
received no account these Three Years last past; but wer are very
confident, that he, at his first Arrival, acted like a bloody Tyrant,
even to extasie and madness, if he be still alive with his Follower,
and did injure, destroy, and consume a vast Number of Men (for he was
branded with infamous Cruelty above all those who with their Assistants
committed Crimes and Enormities of the first Magnitude in these
Kingdoms and Provinces) I conceive, God hath punished him with the same
Violent Death, as he did other Tyrants: But because my Pen is wearied
with relating such Execrable and Sanguinary Deeds (not of Men but
Beasts) I will trouble my self no longer with the dismal and fatal
Consequences thereof. These People were found by them to be Wise, Grave, and well dispos'd,
though their usual Butcheries and Cruelties in opressing them like
Brutes, with heavy Burthens, did rack their minds with great Terror and
Anguish. At their Entry into a certain Village, they were welcomed
with great Joy and Exultation, replenished them with Victuals, till
they were all satisfied, yielding up to them above Six Hundred Men to
carry their Bag and Baggage, and like Grooms to look after their
Horses: The _Spaniards_ departing thence, a Captain related to the
Superiour Tyrant returned thither to rob this (no ways diffident or
mistrustful) People, and pierced their King through with a Lance, of
which Wound he dyed upon the Spot, and committed several other
Cruelties into the bargain.",20321,1400s
"She wrote to
me four or five times into Switzerland, after which she never wrote to me
again, and nothing but my prejudice, confidence and blindness, could have
prevented my discovering in her something more than a coolness towards
me. Guy the bookseller, partner with Duchesne, who, after I had left
Montmorency, frequently went to the hotel de Luxembourg, wrote to me that
my name was in the will of the marechal. There was nothing in this
either incredible or extraordinary, on which account I had no doubt of
the truth of the information. I deliberated within myself whether or not
I should receive the legacy. Everything well considered, I determined to
accept it, whatever it might be, and to do that honor to the memory of an
honest man, who, in a rank in which friendship is seldom found, had had a
real one for me.",3912,1700s
"There were endless
contentions between the pastors and the monks concerning the parochial
right, confessions, burials, sermons on extraordinary occasions, and
innumerable other things. Issues of this sort we have passed over so
that the chief points in this matter, having been briefly set forth,
might be the more readily understood. Nor has anything been here said
or adduced to the reproach of any one. Only those things have been
recounted whereof we thought that it was necessary to speak, in order
that it might be understood that in doctrine and ceremonies nothing has
been received on our part against Scripture or the Church Catholic. For
it is manifest that we have taken most diligent care that no new and
ungodly doctrine should creep into our churches.",275,1400s
"and walking was now out of the question. But I thought the
motion of a carriage and the air would be likely to revive him. On the
power of vernal sights and sounds I did not much rely; for these had
long ceased to affect him. Of all the changes that spring brings with
it, there was one only that now interested Kant; and he longed for it
with an eagerness and intensity of expectation, that it was almost
painful to witness: this was the return of a hedge sparrow that sang in
his garden, and before his window. This bird, either the same, or one
of the next generation, had sung for years in the same situation; and
Kant grew uneasy when the cold weather, lasting longer than usual,
retarded its return.",6147,1700s
"were
prepared stately fire works on the Thames: it hapened, that they took
fire all together, and it was so dreadful, that several spectators
leaped into the river, choosing rather to be drowned than burned. In a
yard by the Thames, was my Lord Powys's coach and horses; the horses
were so frightened by the fire works, that the coachman was not able
to stop them, but ran away over one, who with great difficulty
recovered. When King James II. was at Salisbury, anno 1688, the Iron Crown upon
the turret of the council house, was blown off.- This has often been
confidently asserted by persons who were then living. In February, March, and April, two ravens built their nests on the
weather cock of the high steeple at Bakewell in Derbyshire.",4254,1600s
"I spoke about as follows: ""I
am glad to speak to the law-makers of California. I not only believe
in making laws, but enforcing them."" I called their attention to the most
needed legislation on the lines of prohibition of evil. I could see that all
seemed rather pleased at this point, I drew out the letter which read as
follows: ""Dear Madam: I see you are to visit the capitol tomorrow, I
wish to call your attention to the flagrant violations under the dome of
California's capitol. In the Bill filing room is a place where liquors are
kept, also in the Sergeant-at-Arms room in the senate chamber, behind
a screen, is stored beer and whiskey, in room 56 there is a safe where
bottles of beer and whiskey are kept.",1485,1800s
"Thus was George Fox probably the first
person, who publicly declared against this species of slavery. Nothing
in short, that could be deplored by humanity, seems to have escaped his
eye; and his benevolence, when excited, appears to have suffered no
interruption in its progress by the obstacles, which bigotry would have
thrown in the way of many, on account of the difference of a persons
country, or of his colour, or of his sect. He was patient under his own sufferings. To those, who smote his right
cheek, he offered his left; and, in the true spirit of christianity, he
indulged no rancour against the worst of his oppressors. He made use
occasionally of a rough expression towards them; but he would never have
hurt any of them, if he had had them in his power.",15260,1700s
"Works
cannot accomplish this, and yet, with impious presumption, through
our folly, they take it on themselves to do so; and thus break in with
violence upon the office and glory of grace. We do not then reject good works; nay, we embrace them and teach them in
the highest degree. It is not on their own account that we condemn them,
but on account of this impious addition to them and the perverse notion
of seeking justification by them. These things cause them to be only
good in outward show, but in reality not good, since by them men are
deceived and deceive others, like ravening wolves in sheep's clothing. Now this leviathan, this perverted notion about works, is invincible
when sincere faith is wanting.",1911,1400s

"In the highest and largest compartment, the Death and Assumption of

the Church of S. Maria del Popolo, at Rome (in the third chapel on the
right). It is comprised in five lunettes round the ceiling, beginning
with the Birth of the Virgin, and is remarkable for its elegance. About forty years after this series was completed the people of Siena,
who had always bees remarkable for their devotion to the Virgin,
dedicated to Her honour the beautiful little chapel called the Oratory
of San Bernardino (v. Legends of the Monastic Orders), near the church
of San Francesco, and belonging to the same Order, the Franciscans. This chapel is an exact parallelogram and the frescoes which cover
the four walls are thus arranged above the wainscot, which rises about
eight feet from the ground.",12047,1700s
"Scotty cut the wires loose
with one flick of his knife and Rick lurched onto the road and fled

they had slowed things down for a few minutes at least. The last view he
had was of one man, evidently an officer, trying to rally the troops
again. Rick rounded the turn leading to the hotel grounds and saw that the
scientists were waiting in the jeeps, ready to roll. He slowed long
enough to yell, ""Let's go,"" then led the way down the road to the front
of the hotel and into Calor.",32038,1900s

"This order was the cause of
great disturbances and fighting in the town, because three young
knights of Touraine swore to die in the service of the poor girl, and
to deliver her in all possible ways. Then they came into the town,
accompanied by thousands of sufferers, labouring people, old soldiers,
warriors, courtesans, and others, whom the said girls had succoured,
saved from misfortune, from hunger and misery, and searched all the
poor dwellings of the town where lay those to whom she had done good. Thus all were stirred up and called together to the plain of
Mount-Louis under the protection of the soldiers of the said lords;
they had for companions all the scape-graces of the said twenty
leagues around, and came one morning to lay siege to the prison of the
archbishop, demanding that the Moorish woman should be given up to
them as though they would put her to death, but in fact to set her
free, and to place her secretly upon a swift horse, that she might
gain the open country, seeing that she rode like a groom. Then in this
frightful tempest of men have we seen between the battlements of the
archiepiscopal palace and the bridges, more than ten thousand men
swarming, besides those who were perched upon the roofs of the houses
and climbing on all the balconies to see the sedition; in short it was
easy to hear the horrible cries of the Christians, who were terribly in
earnest, and of those who surrounded the jail with the intention of
setting the poor girl free, across the Loire, the other side of Saint
Symphorien. The suffocation and squeezing of bodies was so great in
this immense crowd, bloodthirsty for the poor creature at whose knees
they would have fallen had they had the opportunity of seeing her, that
seven children, eleven women, and eight citizens were crushed and
smashed beyond all recognition, since they were like splodges of mud;
in short, so wide open was the great mouth of this popular leviathan,
this horrible monster, that the clamour was heard at
Montils-les-Tours.",13260,1700s

in some of the churches and concert-rooms of the city. He had brought along with him two of his own compositions,
""Swamp Robin"" and ""Blackbirds""; and there were some who did not hesitate
to prophesy a brilliant career for him as ""the greatest flute-player

"These threats became
more imposing as it became more apparent in the progress of the question
that the people of Texas would decide in favor of accepting the terms of
annexation, and finally they had assumed such a formidable character as
induced both the Congress and convention of Texas to request that a
military force should be sent by the United States into her territory for
the purpose of protecting and defending her against the threatened
invasion. It would have been a violation of good faith toward the people of
Texas to have refused to afford the aid which they desired against a
threatened invasion to which they had been exposed by their free
determination to annex themselves to our Union in compliance with the
overture made to them by the joint resolution of our Congress. Accordingly,

the joy of a hot soapstone in a flannel bag to drive off the spring
dampness that seeped into the unheated rooms above-stairs. Speedy Relief was the invention of William F. Kenney of South Yarmouth

side-burns who carried a black bag full of small bottles and whose

of the Cape, from whence it was introduced by Mr. MASSON in 1774. Its principal period of flowering is from about the beginning of May to
the middle of June, at which time it is highly ornamental in the
green-house: strong healthy plants produce from five to eight blossoms
in a spike: on a plant growing with Mr. COLVILL, Nurseryman,

impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye, considers this
ray as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object; and in
like manner tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of the eye, it
is directed to the upper part of the object. Thus in the adjacent figure,
C, the lower point of the object ABC, is projected on C the upper part of
the eye. So likewise the highest point A is projected on A the lowest
part of the eye, which makes the representation CBA inverted: but the
mind considering the stroke that is made on C as coming in the straight
line CC from the lower end of the object; and the stroke or impulse on a
as coming in the line AA from the upper end of the object, is directed to
make a right judgment of the situation of the object ABC, notwithstanding
the picture of it is inverted. This is illustrated by conceiving a blind
man who, holding in his hands two sticks that cross each other, doth with
them touch the extremities of an object, placed in a perpendicular
situation. It is certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of
the object which he touches with the stick held in the undermost hand,

When they reached Mrs. Gelbraith's, Penrod sat patiently humped upon a
gilt chair during the lengthy exchange of greetings between his mother. and Mrs. Gelbraith. That is one of the things a boy must learn to bear:
when his mother meets a compeer there is always a long and dreary wait
for him, while the two appear to be using strange symbols of speech,
talking for the greater part, it seems to him, simultaneously, and
employing a wholly incomprehensible system of emphasis at other times
not in vogue. Penrod twisted his legs, his cap and his nose. “Here she is!” Mrs. Gelbraith cried, unexpectedly, and a dark-haired,
demure person entered the room wearing a look of gracious social
expectancy.",402,1800s

Who addresses me thus, at the very top of his voice from the height

Honore de Gabry, peer of France in 1842, who recently died at Monaco. And it was precisely to Monsieur Paul de Gabry’s house that I was going
with that valise of mine, so carefully strapped by my housekeeper. This excellent young man has just inherited, conjointly with his two
brothers-in-law, the property of his uncle, who, belonging to a very

"Just as Lyra also testifies, when he says:
The Church does not consist of men with respect to power, or
ecclesiastical or secular dignity, because many princes and
archbishops and others of lower rank have been found to have
apostatized from the faith. Therefore, the Church consists of those
persons in whom there is a true knowledge and confession of faith and
truth. What else have we said in our Confession than what Lyra here
says [in terms so clear that he could not have spoken more clearly]? But the adversaries perhaps require [a new Roman definition], that
the Church be defined thus, namely, that it is the supreme outward
monarchy of the whole world, in which the Roman pontiff necessarily
has unquestioned power, which no one is permitted to dispute or
censure [no matter whether he uses it rightly, or misuses it], to
frame articles of faith; to abolish, according to his pleasure, the
Scriptures [to pervert and interpret them contrary to all divine law,
contrary to his own decretals, contrary to all imperial rights, as
often, to as great an extent, and whenever it pleases him, to sell
indulgences and dispensations for money]; to appoint rites of worship
and sacrifices; likewise, to frame such laws as he may wish, and to
dispense and exempt from whatever laws he may wish, divine, canonical,
or civil; and that from him [as from the vicegerent of Christ] the
Emperor and all kings receive, according to the command of Christ,
the power and right to hold their kingdoms, from whom, since the
Father has subjected all things to Him, it must be understood, this
right was transferred to the Pope; therefore the Pope must
necessarily be [a God on earth, the supreme Majesty,] lord of the
whole world, of all the kingdoms of the world, of all things private
and public, and must have absolute power in temporal and spiritual
things, and both swords, the spiritual and temporal Besides this
definition, not of the Church of Christ but of the papal kingdom, has
as its authors not only the canonists, but also Daniel 11 36 ff. [Daniel, the prophet, represents Antichrist in this way.]",6744,1400s

any other narrow streak of upland valley. Unnerved by this disaster,

"The pope laid the whole
blame upon the city, and being enraged excommunicated her, in which
state of contumacy she remained as long as the pontiff lived; but was
reblessed by his successor Innocent V.

The pontificate was afterward occupied by Nicholas III. of the Orsini
family. It has to be remarked that it was invariably the custom of the
popes to be jealous of those whose power in Italy had become great, even
when its growth had been occasioned by the favors of the church; and as
they always endeavored to destroy it, frequent troubles and changes were
the result. Their fear of a powerful person caused them to increase the
influence of one previously weak; his becoming great caused him also to
be feared, and his being feared made them seek the means of destroying
him. This mode of thinking and operation occasioned the kingdom of
Naples to be taken from Manfred and given to Charles, but as soon as
the latter became powerful his ruin was resolved upon.",2464,1400s
"John Fox ran to the spot and reached for the thing he had killed,
but his fingers closed on a coarse mop of hair and he turned
Snettishane's face upward to the starlight. He knew how a shotgun
scattered at fifty yards, and he knew that he had peppered
Snettishane across the shoulders and in the small of the back. And
Snettishane knew that he knew, but neither referred to it

"Such was the case at that period. A rage for
polemical divinity took place, and brother against brother fought in
support of each other's tenets; each fully assured he was in the right. The same spirit of innovation is too prevalent in the present day: the
principles they profess are at variance with the prosperity and
happiness of the country. They have made their way into our possessions
in the East Indies; and by their influence have brought on disaffection
among the native troops. From the organization of their native laws,
they are particularly tenacious of their theological principles;
according to which a man had better die than be a sceptic; for on
embracing any other faith, he must first lose his cast;[3] and in that
case he is deserted by all his relatives and countrymen, and driven
from the society of all he holds most dear on earth, so that his life
becomes insupportable.",36339,1600s
"But there was one, and I could see Terry, with compass and
notebook, marking directions and trying to place landmarks. We came after a while to a sort of marshy lake, very big, so that the
circling forest looked quite low and dim across it. Our guide told us
that boats could go from there to our camp--but “long way--all day.”

This water was somewhat clearer than that we had left, but we could not
judge well from the margin. We skirted it for another half hour or so,
the ground growing firmer as we advanced, and presently we turned the
corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country--a
sudden view of mountains, steep and bare. “One of those long easterly spurs,” Terry said appraisingly.",32,1800s

"80. The bishops, curates and theologians who allow such talk to be
spread among the people, will have an account to render. 81. This

learned men, to rescue the reverence due to the pope from slander, or
even from the shrewd questionings of the laity. 82.",274,1400s
"Prostitution is one of the two categories in which Hong Kong has a higher
rate than America. A highly intelligent missionary who has dealt with the
problem for many years had this succinct comment:

“The problem hinges on two factors; the British Army Garrison and the
fact that Hong Kong is a recreation port for the United States Navy. Remove these and the problem vanishes.”

For a variety of realistic reasons, this missionary does not expect
the problem to vanish, though the police and the clergy, working from
different directions, are doing their best to reduce its incidence. Both
groups recognize poverty as one major cause of prostitution that can be
fought with education and better jobs. The comparative rates of narcotics offenses in the United States and
Hong Kong indicate that such crime is sixteen times more prevalent in
the colony than in America.",62191,1900s

"I do not expect that youth should delight to associate with age, or
should lay open its feelings and inclinations to such as have almost
forgot what they were, or how to make proper allowance for them; but if
you are fortunate enough to meet with a young woman eight or ten years
older than yourself, of good sense and good principles, to whom you can
make yourself agreeable, it may be one of the happiest circumstances of
your life. She will be able to advise and to improve you--and your
desire of this assistance will recommend you to her taste, as much as
her superior abilities will recommend her to you. Such a connection will
afford you more pleasure, as well as more profit, than you can expect
from a girl like yourself, equally unprovided with knowledge, prudence,
or any of those qualifications which are necessary to make society
delightful. With a friend, such as I have described, of twenty-three or twenty-four
years of age, you can hardly pass an hour without finding yourself
brought forward in some useful knowledge; without learning something of
the world or of your own nature, some rule of behaviour, or some
necessary caution in the conduct of life: for even in the gayest
conversations, such useful hints may often be gathered from those whose
knowledge and experience are much beyond our own. Whenever you find
yourself in real want of advice, or seek the relief of unburdening your
heart, such a friend will be able to judge of the feelings you describe,
or of the circumstances you are in--perhaps from her own experience--or,
at least, from the knowledge she will have gained of human nature!",35890,1700s

enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men in
armour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter
what hurt and mischief they could. Now was Christian somewhat in
amaze. At last, when every man started back for fear of the armed

man that sat there to write, saying, Set down my name, Sir: the

discouraged, fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely. So after
he had received and given many wounds to those that attempted to

pressed forward into the palace, at which there was a pleasant voice
heard from those that were within, even of those that walked upon

so thoughtless,” she repeated a hundred times a day to her sister,

anything happened, he would have informed us.”

Lady Bothwell listened to her sister without attempting to console her. Probably she might be of opinion that even the worst intelligence which
could be received from Flanders might not be without some touch of
consolation; and that the Dowager Lady Forester, if so she was doomed to
be called, might have a source of happiness unknown to the wife of the
gayest and finest gentleman in Scotland. This conviction became stronger
as they learned from inquiries made at headquarters that Sir Philip was
no longer with the army--though whether he had been taken or slain in
some of those skirmishes which were perpetually occurring, and in which
he loved to distinguish himself, or whether he had, for some unknown
reason or capricious change of mind, voluntarily left the service,

confirming those that were convinced of the truth, and settling good

"Among the rest that day that lost their hearts, was the
Governor’s nephew, who came into the Presence that night wholly
transported, and told _Hermione_ he died for the lovely charmer he had
that day seen; so that she, who was the most curious to gain all the
beauties to her side, that the men might be so too, endeavoured all
she could to find out where this beauty dwelt. _Philander_, now grown
the most amorous and gallant in the world, grew passionately in love
with the very description of her, not imagining it had been _Sylvia_,
because of her equipage: he knew she loved him, at least he thought
she loved him too well to conceal herself from him, or be in
_Brussels_, and not let him know it; so that wholly ravished with the
description of the imagined new fair one, he burnt with desire of
seeing her; and all this night was passed in discourse of this
stranger alone; the next day her livery being described to _Hermione_,
she sent two pages all about the town, to see if they could discover a
livery so remarkable; and that if they did, they should inquire of
them who they belonged to, and where that person’s lodging was. This
was not a very difficult matter to perform: _Brussels_ is not a large
place, and it was soon surveyed from one end to the other: at last
they met with two of her footmen, whom they saluted, and taking notice
of their livery, asked them who they belonged to? These lads were
strangers to the lady they served, and newly taken; and _Sylvia_ at
first coming, resolved to change her name, and was called Madame
de----, a name very considerable in _France_, which they told the
pages, and that she lived in such a place: this news _Hermione_ no
sooner heard, but she sends a gentleman in the name of the Prince and
herself to compliment her, and tell her she had the honour to know
some great persons of that name in _France_, and did not doubt but she
was related to them: she therefore sent to offer her her friendship,
which possibly in a strange place might not be unserviceable to her,

were almost disposed to draw their swords upon me for the lecture which I
had given them. I shall never forget the venerable air of this truly pious
man, who was upwards of seventy years of age. It commanded instant
attention, and as he fixed his eye steadily upon me, the most solemn
silence reigned around. All the angry passions that my speech had excited
were now calmed into the most serious and silent attention, in the
expectation that he was about to give me a severe reprimand for my
intemperate, and, as some considered it, not only indiscreet but audacious
speech.",8685,1700s
"Another kind of
pyrope called _rhodolite_ is noted for its soft, rosy purple color. Actually, rhodolite is one of the intermixed garnets with a composition
somewhere between pyrope and almandine. Most of the fine rhodolite gems
have come from North Carolina. Almandine is popular in its deep red, transparent form, but since the
red is so dark and intense that it appears black, the stones usually are
cut as cabochons with the back hollowed out. This makes them thinner,
and thus lightens their color.",62879,1900s

"There was some reason in ancient necessities, for these ancient customs. Protection was wanted; and the domestic tie, thought not the highest,
was the closest. The king's household has not only several strong traces
of this FEUDALITY, but it is formed also upon the principles of a BODY
CORPORATE; it has its own magistrates, courts, and by-laws. This might
be necessary in the ancient times, in order to have a government within
itself, capable of regulating the vast and often unruly multitude which
composed and attended it. This was the origin of the ancient court
called the GREEN CLOTH--composed of the marshal, treasurer, and other
great officers of the household, with certain clerks.",3286,1700s

with all the affectionate pride of a student for his alma mater. The

"When the melancholy and much dreaded
time approached, Lord Peyton gave me secret information that he would
invite my father into the country, on pretence of assisting him by his
advice in some alterations he was going to make there; and assured me of
careful attendance, and the most secret reception, from a very worthy
couple to whose house he gave me a direction if I could contrive, under
colour of some intended visit, to leave my own. 'All was executed as he had planned it; and when my servants thought I
was gone to visit a relation some miles distant from London, I went as
directed, and was received with the greatest humanity imaginable by Mr
and Mrs Selvyn; not at their own house, but at one taken for that
purpose, where the affair might be more secretly managed. Lord Peyton
had concealed my name even from them; and secured their care of me under
a borrowed appellation. 'The day after I got to them I was delivered of you, my dearest child,
whom I beheld with sorrow as well as affliction; considering you as the
melancholy memorial and partner in my shame. 'Mr and Mrs Selvyn attended me with the greatest care, and were never

"This is the celebrated clause in which the Constitution is said
to recognize slavery. To our view the clause is perfectly
immaterial in this sense, making the simple provision that so
long as a State shall choose to keep a portion of her people in
this subordinate condition, she shall enjoy only this limited
degree of representation. To us, it appears to be a concession
made to freedom, and not to slavery. There is no obligation,
unless self-imposed, to admit any but a minority of her whites to
the enjoyment of political power, aristocracy being, in truth,
more closely assimilated to republicanism than democracy. Republicanism means the sovereignty of public THINGS instead of
that of PERSONS; or the representation of the COMMON interests,

needling each other. I'd talk to him about the vast carpet of the future unrolling before us,
of the certainty that we would encounter alien intelligences some day,

Motive, it is possible for a Man to think righter than the common
opinion, and to argue, that a Rival taketh away nothing but the Heart, and
leaveth all the rest. In his latter Times he had no _Love_, but insensible Engagements that made
it harder than most might apprehend to untie them. The _Politicks_ might
have their part; a Secret, a Commission, a Confidence in critical Things,
though it doth not give a Lease for a precise term of Years, yet there may
be Difficulties in dismissing them; there may be no Love all the while;
perhaps the contrary. He was said to be as little constant as they were thought to be. Though he
had no Love, he must have some Appetite, or else he could not keep them

extreme old age. At a very advanced stage of life he wrote the
following discourses, wherein he acquaints us with the irregularity

the one-volume tale was plodding its weary round in London: in three

the preference to Virgil in their esteem; but let them like for
themselves, and not prescribe to others, for our author needs not their
admiration. The motive that induced Virgil to coin this fable I have showed already,

superseding the mechanic rules of poetry, for the same reason that a
monarch may dispense with or suspend his own laws when he finds it
necessary so to do, especially if those laws are not altogether
fundamental. Nothing is to be called a fault in poetry, says Aristotle,
but what is against the art; therefore a man may be an admirable poet
without being an exact chronologer. Shall we dare, continues Segrais, to

concealed it, until S. _Thomas_ Eve before _Christmas_, when being soon
after Sunset walking in his Garden she appeared again, and then so
threatened and affrighted him that he faithfully promised to reveal it
next morning. In the morning he went to a Magistrate and made the whole
matter known with all the circumstances, and diligent search being made,
the body was found in a coal-pit, with five wounds in the head, and the
pick and shooes and stockings yet bloody, in every circumstance as the
apparition had related unto the Miller. Whereupon _Walker_ and _Mark
Sharp_ were both apprehended, but would confess nothing. At the Assizes
following (I think it was at _Durham_) they were arraigned, found
guilty, condemned and executed, but I could never hear that they
confessed the fact. There were some that reported that the apparition
did appear to the Judge or the Foreman of the Jury, (who was alive in
_Chester_ in the street about ten years ago, as I have been credibly
informed) but of that I know no certainty.” There are many persons yet

four subspecies, one newly named, can be ascribed with certainty to

better known today than was that of North America in 1885 when Dr. C.

Catholics are the far more numerous part of the Christians in your
country; and how can Christianity (that is now the point in issue) be
supported under the persecution, or even under the discountenance, of
the greater number of Christians? It is a great truth, and which in one
of the debates I stated as strongly as I could to the House of Commons
in the last session, that, if the Catholic religion is destroyed by the
infidels, it is a most contemptible and absurd idea, that this, or any
Protestant Church, can survive that event. Therefore my humble and
decided opinion is, that all the three religions prevalent more or less
in various parts of these islands ought all, in subordination to the
legal establishments as they stand in the several countries, to be all
countenanced, protected, and cherished, and that in Ireland particularly
the Roman Catholic religion should be upheld in high respect and
veneration, and should be, in its place, provided with all the means of
making it a blessing to the people who profess it,--that it ought to be
cherished as a good, (though not as the most preferable good, if a
choice was now to be made,) and not tolerated as an inevitable evil. If
this be my opinion as to the Catholic religion as a sect, you must see
that I must be to the last degree averse to put a man, upon that
account, upon a bad footing with relation to the privileges which the
fundamental laws of this country give him as a subject.",15702,1700s

all remedies for her health to be desperate, I looked on her with
contempt, and, giving her a bill of divorcement, said to her, ""He that

be filthy still,"" giving myself up to the peaceful and quiet study of
sacred literature, that by this I might be of use to the brethren living

eyes and goaded on his servant John Eccius, that notorious adversary of
Christ, by the unchecked lust for fame, to drag me unexpectedly into the

the Church of Rome, which had fallen from me in passing. That boastful
Thraso, foaming and gnashing his teeth, proclaimed that he would dare
all things for the glory of God and for the honour of the holy apostolic
seat; and, being puffed up respecting your power, which he was about

any need of these things for justification or salvation, but that I

community or such a magistrate, or of my neighbour as an example to him;
for this cause I will do and suffer all things, just as Christ did and
suffered much more for me, though He needed not at all to do so on His
own account, and made Himself for my sake under the law, when He was
not under the law. And although tyrants may do me violence or wrong in
requiring obedience to these things, yet it will not hurt me to do them,
so long as they are not done against God. From all this every man will be able to attain a sure judgment and
faithful discrimination between all works and laws, and to know who
are blind and foolish pastors, and who are true and good ones. For
whatsoever work is not directed to the sole end either of keeping under
the body, or of doing service to our neighbour--provided he require
nothing contrary to the will of God--is no good or Christian work.",1911,1400s

"_A Description of_ Galata; _of the Temples of_ Amphiaraus, Diana,
  _and_ Venus; _of the Theatre of_ Sycæ, _and the_ Forum _of_ Honorius. The _Sycene Ward_, which is commonly called _Galata_, or _Pera_,
ought more properly to be called the _Peræan Ward_. Thus it is that
_Josephus_ calls _Judæa_, because it lay on the _other Side_ of the
River _Jordan_: And thus it is, that _Strabo_ calls that Part of the
Countrey which lies on the _other Side_ of _Euphrates_. The Reason
alledg’d by the Inhabitants, why ’tis call’d _Galata_, is, as they
tell you, (being impos’d upon by the Allusion of the Name) that _Milk_
was formerly sold there: And I make no Question of it, did they but
know, that _Galata_ was formerly call’d _Sycæ_, they would derive its
Name from the Word _Fig_; and pretend to justify their Mistake from
the Authority of _Dionysius_ their Countryman, who says, that it was
originally call’d _Sycæ_, from the Fairness and Abundance of that
Fruit which grew there. But their Conjectures had been grounded upon a
better Foundation, if they had deriv’d the Name of _Galata_ from the
_Galatæ_, back’d by the Authority of _Johannes Tzetzes_ (a Citizen of
_Constantinople_, and a very industrious Grammarian) in his _Var.",53083,1400s
"Nothing then could serve well for a
convenient measure of time, but what has divided the whole length of
its duration into apparently equal portions, by constantly repeated
periods. What portions of duration are not distinguished, or considered
as distinguished and measured, by such periods, come not so properly
under the notion of time; as appears by such phrases as these, viz. ‘Before all time,’ and ‘When time shall be no more.’

made use of for the measure of duration.",10615,1600s

nor of the Princess Aline. He was thinking of the many hours Miss
Morris and he had been together, of the way she had looked at certain
times, and of how he had caught himself watching her at others; how he
had pictured the absent Mr. Abbey travelling with her later over the
same route, and without a chaperon, sitting close at her side or
holding her hand, and telling her just how pretty she was whenever he
wished to do so, and without any fear of the consequences.",327,1800s

"The pulling of a few strings, however, gives a totally
novel aspect to the face of affairs. Inanimate objects continue, of
course, at rest; but no sooner is the clock-work set a-going, than
music sounds, soldiers march, carriages rattle about, ploughs travel,
miners dig, mills go round, monks toll bells, hermits read and nod
their heads, milkmaids ply their occupation visibly and effectively
before your eyes,--aye, and the very bird-catcher pops out and in from
behind his screen, while a rustic having caught a schoolboy in his
apple-tree, applies his rod to the young thief's seat of honour, with
all the regularity of a drummer beating time. I defy the gravest person
living to abstain from laughter, when this universal bustle begins; for
no human being appears to be idle, and no single act seems to be
performed in vain. The Graffs Kinsky seem, for some years back, to have paid a good deal
of attention to this noble relic of old times. The late count began a
chapel, I think in questionable taste, of which the walls now cover the
venerable and vaulted cavity, where knights and barons used to worship
long ago.",24419,1700s
"The very loves that belt thee must prevent
   My love, I know, with their legitimacy:
   As the metallic vapours, that are swept
   Athwart the sun, in his light intercept
               The very hues
   Which _their_ conflagrant elements effuse. But, my love, my heart, my fair,
         That only I should see thee rare,
   Or tent to the hid core thy rarity,—
      This were a mournfulness more piercing far
      Than that those other loves my own must bar,
   Or thine for others leave thee none for me. But on a day whereof I think,
         One shall dip his hand to drink
         In that still water of thy soul,
         And its imaged tremors race
         Over thy joy-troubled face,
         As the intervolved reflections roll
         From a shaken fountain’s brink,
         With swift light wrinkling its alcove. From the hovering wing of Love
   The warm stain shall flit roseal on thy cheek,
         Then, sweet blushet! whenas he,
   The destined paramount of thy universe,
      Who has no worlds to sigh for, ruling thee,
      Àscends his vermeil throne of empery,
            One grace alone I seek.",1731,1800s
"His sister

that had taken place before her very eyes. Robert spoke first. ""Golly, it's a little house."" ""A doll house!"" Emily elaborated, falling to her knees, and staring in

""But I want you to go with me to the garden,"" replied his father; ""there
are some pears to be gathered, and I know somebody that is very fond of

"Often the swiftest among
them was seen to dodge from under the very nose of some pompous lawgiver

or a chain of girls would suddenly break at the approach of a fat old
burgomaster who, with gold-headed cane poised in air, was puffing his
way to Amsterdam. Equipped in skates wonderful to behold, with their
superb strappings and dazzling runners curving over the instep and
topped with gilt balls, he would open his fat eyes a little if one of
the maidens chanced to drop him a curtsy but would not dare to bow in
return for fear of losing his balance. Not only pleasure seekers and stately men of note were upon the canal. There were workpeople, with weary eyes, hastening to their shops and
factories; market women with loads upon their heads; peddlers bending
with their packs; bargemen with shaggy hair and bleared faces, jostling
roughly on their way; kind-eyed clergymen speeding perhaps to the
bedsides of the dying; and, after a while, groups of children with
satchels slung over their shoulders, whizzing past, toward the distant
school. One and all wore skates except, indeed, a muffled-up farmer

themselves the trouble of an unprofitable labour under these unreasonable

his bosom, as they were when nailed to the cross. This is coming to
Christ for life aright; this is right running away from thy master to
him, as was said before. And for this we have multitudes of scriptures
to support, encourage, and comfort us in our so doing. But now, let him that doth thus be sure to look for it, for Satan will be
with him to-morrow, to see if he can get him again to his old service;

"When the University of Oxford
hesitated to give Warburton, who had never attended a university, the
degree of D.D., Pope declined to accept the degree of D.C.L. which had
been offered him at the same time, and wrote the Fourth Book of the
'Dunciad' to satirize the stupidity of the university authorities. In
conjunction with Warburton he proceeded further to revise the whole
poem, for which his new friend wrote notes and a ponderous introduction,
and made the capital mistake of substituting the frivolous, but clever,
Colley Gibber, with whom he had recently become embroiled, for his old
enemy, Theobald, as the hero. And the last year of his life was spent in
getting out new editions of his poems accompanied by elaborate
commentaries from the pen of Warburton. In the spring of 1744, it was evident that Pope was failing fast.",9800,1600s

"He takes these domains, almost the last
wrecks of empire left to the descendant of Tamerlane, from the man, I
say, to whose voluntary grants we owe it that we have put a foot in
Bengal. Surely, we ought, at least, to have kept our faith in leaving
this last retreat to that unfortunate prince. The House of Commons was
of that opinion, and consequently they resolved, ""That the transfer of
Corah and Allahabad to the Vizier was contrary to policy and good
faith."" This is what the Commons think of this business which Mr.
Hastings pleads as merits. But I have not yet done with it.",18315,1700s

      As he turned over in his thoughts all that he had been told of
      the singular adventure of the black fisherman, his imagination
      gave a totally different complexion to the tale. He saw in the
      gang of redcaps nothing but a crew of pirates burying their
      spoils, and his cupidity was once more awakened by the
      possibility of at length getting on the traces of some of this
      lurking wealth. Indeed, his infected fancy tinged every thing
      with gold. He felt like the greedy inhabitant of Bagdad, when his
      eye had been greased with the magic ointment of the dervise, that
      gave him to see all the treasures of the earth. Caskets of buried
      jewels, chests of ingots, bags of outlandish coins, seemed to
      court him from their concealments, and supplicate him to relieve
      them from their untimely graves.",13514,1700s

it; that report of raising the money having only occasioned a demand

"Rinaldo then reminded the new
Gonfalonier how Salvestro de' Medici was able, though unjustly, to
restrain the power of the Guelphs, to whom, by the blood of their
ancestors, shed in its cause, the government rightly belonged; and
argued that what he was able unjustly to accomplish against so many,
might surely be easily performed with justice in its favor against one! He encouraged him with the assurance that their friends would be ready
in arms to support him; that he need not regard the plebeians, who
adored Cosmo, since their assistance would be of no greater avail than
Giorgio Scali had found it on a similar occasion; and that with regard
to his wealth, no apprehension was necessary, for when he was under
the power of the Signory, his riches would be so too. In conclusion, he
averred that this course would unite and secure the republic, and crown
the Gonfalonier with glory. Bernardo briefly replied, that he thought
it necessary to act exactly as Rinaldo had advised, and that as the time
was suitable for action, he should provide himself with forces, being
assured from what Rinaldo had said, he would be supported by his
colleagues. Bernardo entered upon the duties of his office, prepared his followers,
and having concerted with Rinaldo, summoned Cosmo, who, though many
friends dissuaded him from it, obeyed the call, trusting more to his own
innocence than to the mercy of the Signory.",2464,1400s

in effect as our Author has prementioned, now in regard that I judge
such reiterated Cruelties and repeated Barbarisms are Offensive to the

Slaughter of Sheep the chief Food and Support of the _Spaniards_ as
well as _Indians_, permitting them to kill Two or Three Hundred at a
time, only for their Brains, Fat, or Suet, whose Flesh was then
altogether useless, and not fit to be eaten; but many _Indians_, the
_Spaniards_ Friends and Confederates followed them, desiring they might
have the hearts to feed upon, whereupon they butchered a great many of
them, for this only Reason, because they would not eat the other parts
of the Body. Two of their gang in the Province of _Peru_ kild Twenty
Five Sheep, who were sold among the _Spaniards_ for Twenty Five Crowns,

keep the Power of making Peace in their own Hands, and for that Purpose,
to call a Meeting of the _Sachems_ of _Onondago_, where all such Matters
had been formerly transacted among themselves, and there to determine
independently, rather than to submit themselves to another Nation at
_Albany_. They only invited the _English_ to assist at the general
Council. The _English_ used what Arguments they could to dissuade this
Meeting, but rather to observe the Promise made to the Governor; and it
seems used some Threatning. The _Mohawks_ had so much Regard to the
_English_, that they refused to assist at the Council. The other four,
notwithstanding this, met, and resolved on an Answer to be sent to the
Governor of _Canada_; but at the same Time, to shew their Regard to the
_Mohawks_ and _English_, these Resolutions were not to be final, till
they should first be communicated to the _English_ and _Mohawks_, and

"And they indeed have. For this good order is very becoming
in the Church, and for this reason is necessary. But human reason,
because it does not understand the righteousness of faith, naturally
imagines that such works justify men because they reconcile God, etc. Thus the common people among the Israelites thought, and by this
opinion increased such ceremonies, just as among us they have grown
in the monasteries [as in our time one altar after another and one
church after another is founded]. Thus human reason judges also of

sooner he cannot die, as a sober life has the virtue to remove all
the usual causes of sickness, and sickness cannot happen without a
cause; which cause being removed, sickness is, likewise, removed; and
sickness being removed, an untimely and violent death must be
prevented. And there is no doubt, that temperance has the virtue and efficacy
to remove such causes; for since health and sickness, life and
death, depend on the good or bad quality of the humours, temperance
corrects their vicious tendencies, and renders them perfect, being
possessed of the natural power of making them unite and hold
together, so as to render them inseperable, and incapable of
alteration and fermenting; circumstances, which engender cruel
fevers, and end in death. It is true, indeed, and it would be a
folly to deny it, that, let our humours be originally ever so good,
time, which consumes every thing, cannot fail to consume and exhaust
them; and that man, as soon as that happens, must die of a natural
death; but yet without sickness, as will be my case, who shall die
at my appointed time, when these humours shall be consumed, which
they are not at present. Nay, they are still perfect; nor is it
possible they should be otherwise in my present condition, when I
find myself hearty and content, eating with a good appetite, and
sleeping soundly. Moreover, all my faculties are as good as ever,

it from being set on fire. But all his efforts were ineffectual, as the
Guachacoyans thrust burning brands into the thatch of the houses, which

at the blackness of my nails the day that I began to lose the first
whiteness of my soul by falling in love at fifteen with the parish
organist, or rather with the glimpse of surplice and Roman nose and
fiery moustache which was all I ever saw of him, and which I loved to
distraction for at least six months; at the end of which time, going
out with my governess one day, I passed him in the street, and
discovered that his unofficial garb was a frock-coat combined with a
turn-down collar and a “bowler” hat, and never loved him any more. The first part of that time of blessedness was the most perfect, for I
had not a thought of anything but the peace and beauty all round me. Then he appeared suddenly who has a right to appear when and how he
will and rebuked me for never having written, and when I told him that

and it is considered by almost all as defective in many of its parts. The power to impose duties on imports originally belonged to the
several States. The right to adjust those duties with a view to the
encouragement of domestic branches of industry is so completely
incidental to that power that it is difficult to suppose the existence
of the one without the other. The States have delegated their whole
authority over imports to the General Government without limitation or
restriction, saving the very inconsiderable reservation relating to
their inspection laws. This authority having thus entirely passed from
the States, the right to exercise it for the purpose of protection does
not exist in them, and consequently if it be not possessed by the

"Approved in 3d Marine Division Memorandum
274-43, the insignia consisted of a caltrop on a triangular,
gold-bordered scarlet shield. The caltrop was a medieval defensive
weapon used against both cavalry and infantry. During the warfare of
the Middle Ages, large numbers of caltrops were scattered by defenders
on the ground in front of an approaching enemy. The four-pronged,
forged-iron caltrop was designed so that no matter which way it landed
when thrown on the ground, one point would be up with the other
three points supporting it. When used on the insignia, the caltrop
represented not only the 3d Marine Division, but also the motto painted
on the drums carried by the Continental Marines in the American
Revolution: “Don’t Tread on Me.”

Isabelle was afraid, when she heard these incoherent phrases, that the

eyes so clear and steady, her voice so earnest, and she spoke with such
an air of quiet conviction, that the supposition was not admissible,

merely boasting, she continued, “Let me think a moment, to make a

Chiquita bent down her head, put her hand over her eyes, and remained
for several minutes perfectly motionless; then she raised her head and
without a word went and opened the window, clambered up on the sill,

no apprehension of an attack. But the greatest source of anxiety to the
count, and alarm to the Venetians, was the desertion of his service by
Ciarpellone, one of his principal officers. Francesco, on learning these
matters, immediately left Venice, and, arriving at Brescia, found that
Niccolo, after doing all the mischief he could, had retired to his
quarters; and therefore, finding the war concluded for the present was
not disposed to rekindle it, but rather to use the opportunity afforded
by the season and his enemies, of reorganizing his forces, so as to be
able, when spring arrived, to avenge himself for his former injuries. To this end he induced the Venetians to recall the forces they had
in Tuscany, in the Florentine service, and to order that to succeed
Gattamelata, who was dead, Micheletto Attendulo should take the command. On the approach of spring, Niccolo Piccinino was the first to take

had been lost, and Nelson immediately put the intentions of Russia to

till a message was sent to them to inquire for what reason; and the
officer whose neglect had occasioned the delay, was put under arrest. Nelson wrote to the emperor, proposing to wait on him personally and

been taken--to weld intelligence to cunning, connect thought to

natural desert dwellers, four-footed and winged, could not be so
controlled. For thousands of years, since the first southward roving Amerindian
tribes had met with their kind, there had been a hunter of the open

an undeniable impression on the human mind. He was in countless Indian

"His mother had once prevented him from entering the navy, when a gallant
frigate was at hand, anchored in the waters of the Potomac; with all his
deference for her, which he retained through life, he could not resist the
appeal to his martial sympathies, which called him to the head-quarters of
General Braddock at Alexandria. His arrival was hailed by his young associates, Captains Orme and Morris,
the general's aides-de-camp, who at once received him into frank
companionship, and a cordial intimacy commenced between them, that
continued throughout the campaign. He experienced a courteous reception from the general, who expressed in
flattering terms the impression he had received of his merits. Washington
soon appreciated the character of the general. He found him stately and
somewhat haughty, exact in matters of military etiquette and discipline,
positive in giving an opinion, and obstinate in maintaining it; but of an
honorable and generous, though somewhat irritable nature.",7002,1700s

both hands and feet, and a voice calling out, ""Navarre! Navarre!"" My
nurse, supposing the King my husband to be at the door, hastened to open
it, when a gentleman, named M. de Teian, ran in, and threw himself
immediately upon my bed. He had received a wound in his arm from a

followed him into the bedchamber.",3838,1500s

"These opinions
have clearly sprung from heathen examples. For thus, among the
Romans Juno was thought to enrich, Febris to keep off fever, Castor
and Pollux to protect horsemen, etc. Even though we should imagine
that the invocation of saints were taught with the greatest prudence,
yet since the example is most dangerous, why is it necessary to
defend it when it has no command or testimony from God's Word? Aye,
it has not even the testimony of the ancient writers. First because,
as I have said above, when other mediators are sought in addition to
Christ, and confidence is put in others, the entire knowledge of
Christ is suppressed.",6744,1400s

"They live by what they can get by industry
from the earth, and others by what they can catch by craft from men. They live upon an estate given them by their mother, and others upon an
estate cheated from their brethren. They live like sheep and kine, by
the allowances of Nature, and others like wolves and foxes by the
acquisitions of rapine; and, I hope, I may affirm (without any offence to
the great) that sheep and kine are very useful, and that wolves and foxes
are pernicious creatures. They are, without dispute, of all men the most
quiet and least apt to be inflamed to the disturbance of the
commonwealth; their manner of life inclines them, and interest binds
them, to love peace. In our late mad and miserable civil wars, all other
trades, even to the meanest, set forth whole troops, and raised up some
great commanders, who became famous and mighty for the mischiefs they had
done.",3549,1600s

wouldn’t stop you at all — and it’s great joy she’ll have looking on
your face — but let you cure myself along with her, the way I’ll see
when it’s lies she’s telling, and be looking out day and night upon the
holy men of God.",1241,1800s
"In the midst of all this there sounded upon my ears a voice which I
recognised as that of the Mæcenas of British literature: ‘Borromeo, don’t
believe all you hear, nor think that you have accomplished anything so
very extraordinary: a great portion of your book is very sorry trash
indeed—Gypsy poetry, dry laws, and compilations from dull Spanish
authors: it has good points, however, which show that you are capable of
something much better: try your hand again—avoid your besetting sins; and
when you have accomplished something which will really do credit to —
Street, it will be time enough to think of another delivery of these
_Gypsies_.’

Mistos amande: ‘I am content,’ I replied; and sitting down I commenced
the _Bible in Spain_. At first I proceeded slowly—sickness was in the
land, and the face of nature was overcast—heavy rain-clouds swam in the
heavens,—the blast howled amid the pines which nearly surround my lonely
dwelling, and the waters of the lake which lies before it, so quiet in
general and tranquil, were fearfully agitated. ‘Bring lights hither, O
Hayim Ben Attar, son of the miracle!’  And the Jew of Fez brought in the
lights, for though it was midday I could scarcely see in the little room
where I was writing. . .",565,1800s
"If a man says that extinction is better
than existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure,
then he is not one of the ordinary people to whom I am talking. If a man prefers nothing I can give him nothing. But nearly all
people I have ever met in this western society in which I live
would agree to the general proposition that we need this life
of practical romance; the combination of something that is strange
with something that is secure. We need so to view the world as to
combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome. We need to be
happy in this wonderland without once being merely comfortable.",130,1800s

"She had always
had a look of musty mourning (as if she were wearing out old robes of
sorrow that would not come to an end), and in this respect there was no
appreciable change in her appearance. But she evidently had been crying,
crying a great deal--simply, satisfyingly, refreshingly, with a sort of
primitive, retarded sense of loneliness and violence. But she had none
of the formalism or the self-consciousness of grief, and I was almost
surprised to see her standing there in the first dusk with her hands
full of flowers, smiling at me with her reddened eyes. Her white face,
in the frame of her mantilla, looked longer, leaner than usual. I had
had an idea that she would be a good deal disgusted with me--would
consider that I ought to have been on the spot to advise her, to help
her; and, though I was sure there was no rancor in her composition and
no great conviction of the importance of her affairs, I had prepared
myself for a difference in her manner, for some little injured look,
half-familiar, half-estranged, which should say to my conscience, “Well,
you are a nice person to have professed things!” But historic truth
compels me to declare that Tita Bordereau’s countenance expressed

"The
largest seals are from five to eight feet in length; their fat yields
better train-oil than that of any other fish. This is the most common of
all the sea animals in Greenland; and contributes the most to the
subsisting and maintaining of the inhabitants, who feed upon the flesh
of it, and clothe themselves with the skin, which likewise serves them
for the covering of their boats and tents: the fat is their fuel, which
they burn in their lamps, and also boil their victuals with. As for other sea monsters and wonderful animals, we find in Tormoder’s
History of Greenland, mention made of three sorts of monsters, where he
quotes a book, called “Speculum Regale Iclandicum;” or, the Royal Island
Looking-Glass, from whence he borrows what he relates[29]. But none of
them have been seen by us, or any of our time, that ever I could hear,
save that most dreadful monster, that showed itself upon the surface of
the water in the year 1734, off our new colony in 64°. This monster was
of so huge a size, that coming out of the water, its head reached as
high as the mast-head; its body was as bulky as the ship, and three or
four times as long.",58308,1600s

"And these are the worthy Services which the Spaniards do for our Kings
in those Countries, by the injust and colourable pretences aforesaid. This Tyrant upon the same pretext sent two other Captains, who exceeded
him in impiety and cruelty, if possible to the most flourishing and
Feril (in Fruits and Men) Kingdoms of _Guatemala_, Situate toward the
South, who had also received Orders to go to the Kingdoms of _Naco,
Hondera_, and _Guaymura_, verging upon the North, and are Borderers on
_Mexico_ three hundred miles together. The one was sent by Land and
the other by Sea, and both well furnished with Horse and Foot. This I declare for a Truth, that the outrages committed by these two,
particularly by him that went to _Guatimala_ (for the other not long
after his departure died a violent Death) would afford matter
sufficient for an entire Volume, and when completed he so crouded with
slaughters, injuries, butcheries and inhuman Desolations, so horrid and
detestable as would Ague-shake the present as well as future ages with
terror. He that put out to Sea vexed all the Maritime Coasts with his cruel
Incursions; now some inhabitants of the Kingdom of _Jucatan_ which is
seated in the way to the Kingdoms of _Naco_ and _Naymura_, to which
places he steered his course, came to meet him with burthens of
Presents and Gifts: and as soon as he approacht them, sent his Captains
with a party of Soldiers to depopulate their Land, who committed great
spoils and made cruel slaughters among them; and in particular a
Seditious and Rebellious Officer who with three hundres Soldiers entred
a Neighboring Country to _Guatimala_, and there firing the Cities and
Murdering all the Inhabitants, violently deprived them of all their
goods, which he did designedly, for the space of an hundred and twenty
miles; to the end that if his Companions should follow them, they might
find the Country laid wast, and so be destroyed by the _Indians_ in

CHAPTER XVII. A DECLARATION


Dunn knew very well that he ought to give immediate information to the
authorities of what had happened. But he did not. He told himself that nothing could help poor John
Clive, and that any precipitate action on his part might still fatally
compromise his plans, which were now so near completion. But his real reason was that he knew that if he came forward he would be
very closely questioned, and sooner or later forced to tell the things
he knew so terribly involving Ella.",1888,1800s
"Strange to say (the result
perhaps of the concussion of air occasioned by the blowing up of the
city) huge, white thunder clouds lifted themselves up from the southern
horizon, and gathered over-head; they were the first blots on the blue
expanse that I had seen for months, and amidst this havoc and despair
they inspired pleasure. The vault above became obscured, lightning
flashed from the heavy masses, followed instantaneously by crashing
thunder; then the big rain fell. The flames of the city bent beneath
it; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated. I no sooner perceived an abatement of the flames than, hurried on by an
irresistible impulse, I endeavoured to penetrate the town. I could only
do this on foot, as the mass of ruin was impracticable for a horse.",18247,1700s

few of these on either side (which it was able to shut up or expand at
pleasure, much like a Fann, or rather like the posture of the feathers in a
wing, which ly all one under another, when shut, and by the side of each
other, when expanded) this pretty little grey Moth (for such was the
creature I observ’d, thus wing’d) could very nimbly, and as it seem’d very
easily move its _corpuscle_, through the Air, from place to place. Other
Insects have their wings cas’d, or cover’d over, with certain hollow
shells, shap’d almost like those hollow Trayes, in which Butchers carry
meat, whose hollow sides being turn’d downwards, do not only secure their
folded wings from injury of the earth, in which most of those creatures
reside, but whilst they fly, serves as a help to sustain and bear them up. And these are observable in _Scarabees_ and a multitude of other
terrestrial _crustaceous_ Insects; in which we may yet further observe a
particular providence of Nature. Now in all these kinds of wings, we observe this particular, as a thing
most worthy remark; that where ever a wing consists of discontinued parts,
the Pores or _interstitia_ between those parts are very seldom, either much
bigger, or much smaller, then these which we here find between the
particles of these brushes, so that it should seem to intimate, that the
parts of the Air are such, that they will not easily or readily, if at all,
pass through these Pores, so that they seem to be strainers fine enough to
hinder the particles of the Air (whether hinder’d by their bulk, or by
their _agitation_, _circulation_, _rotation_ or _undulation_, I shall not
here determine) from getting through them, and, by that means, serve the
Animal as well, if not better, then if they were little films. I say, if
not better, because I have observ’d that all those creatures, that have
film’d wings, move them aboundantly quicker and more strongly, such as all
kind of Flies and _Scarabees_ and Batts, then such as have their wings
covered with feathers, as Butter-flies and Birds, or twiggs, as Moths,
which have each of them a much slower motion of their wings; That little
ruggedness perhaps of their wings helping them somewhat, by taking better
hold of the parts of the Air, or not suffering them so easily to pass by,
any other way then one.",15491,1600s

His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight
Upborn with indefatigable wings
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive

Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
All circumspection, and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,
The weight of all and our last hope relies. This said, he sat; and expectation held
His look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d

Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each

"The Comte d'Aubigne passed from an inferior government to a government of
some importance. He made himself beloved by endorsing a thousand
petitions destined for his sister, the monarch's friend; but his
immoderate expenditure caused him to contract debts that his sister would
only pay five or six times. The Duc de Vivonne, my brother, laughed at him in society; he unceasingly
outraged by his clumsiness his sister's sense of discretion. One day, in
a gaming-house, seeing the table covered with gold, the Marshal exclaimed
at the door: ""I will wager that D'Aubigne is here, and makes all this

that of many pious people, that America was the country where the
church of Christ would preeminently flourish. She was therefore
desirous to leave her offspring there. After some correspondence with Dr. Witherspoon, and consultation
with pious friends, her plan received the approbation of the latter;
and having had an invitation from many respectable characters in the
city of New York, with assurances of patronage and support, she
arranged her affairs for quitting Edinburgh. The Algerines being then
at war with the United States, her friends insisted on her chartering
a small British vessel to carry herself and family to the port of New
York. This increased her expenses; but Providence, in faithfulness and
mercy, sent her at this time a remittance from Dr. Henderson, the

made in consequence to welcome the Kalmucks with the most paternal
benevolence. But as these couriers had been despatched from the Torgau
at the moment of arrival thither, and before the advance of Traubenberg
had made it necessary for the Khan to order a hasty renewal of the
flight, the Emperor had not looked for their arrival on their frontier
until full three months after the present time. The Khan had indeed
expressly notified his intention to pass the summer heats on the banks
of the Torgau, and to recommence his retreat about the beginning of
September. The subsequent change of plan being unknown to Kien Long,
left him for some time in doubt as to the true interpretation to be put
upon this mighty apparition in the desert; but at length the savage
clamors of hostile fury, and the clangor of weapons, unveiled to the
Emperor the true nature of those unexpected calamities which had so
prematurely precipitated the Kalmuck measure. Apprehending the real state of affairs, the Emperor instantly perceived
that the first act of his fatherly care for these erring children (as
he esteemed them) now returning to their ancient obedience, must be--
to deliver them from their pursuers.",6146,1700s
"This is acknowledged in Lord Durham's report, which says:--

""Without going so far as to accuse the Assembly of a deliberate design
to check the settlement and improvement of Lower Canada, it cannot be
denied that they looked with considerable jealousy and dislike on the
increase and prosperity of what they regarded as a foreign and hostile
race; they looked on the province as the patrimony of their own race;
they viewed it not as a country to be settled, but as one already
settled; and instead of legislating in the American spirit, and first
providing for the future population of the province, their primary care
was, in the spirit of legislation which prevails in the old world, to
guard the interests and feelings of the present race of inhabitants, to
whom they considered the newcomers as subordinate; they refused to
increase the burthens of the country by imposing taxes to meet the
expenditure required for improvement, and they also refused to direct to
that object any of the funds previously devoted to other purposes. The
improvement of the harbour of Montreal was suspended, from a political
antipathy to a leading English merchant who had been the most active of
the commissioners, and by whom it had been conducted with the most
admirable success. It is but just to say, that some of the works which
the Assembly authorised and encouraged, were undertaken on a scale of
due moderation, and satisfactorily perfected and brought into operation. Others, especially the great communications which I have mentioned
above, the Assembly showed a great reluctance to promote or even to
permit. It is true that there was considerable foundation for their
objections to the plan on which the Legislature of Upper Canada had
commenced some of these works, and to the mode in which it had carried
them on; but the English complained that, instead of profiting by the
experience which they might have derived from this source, the Assembly
seemed only to make its objections a pretext for doing nothing.",23138,1700s

Charity be wanting. And since 'tis a Maxim, _That the best of Men cannot be

affairs of state. Regarding government as an institution for the public
good, they demand a knowledge of its operations, and a participation in
its exercise. A call for the representative system, wherever it is not
enjoyed, and where there is already intelligence enough to estimate its
value, is perseveringly made. Where men may speak out, they demand it;

conscious effort into the terminology of the subject. He lost himself
amongst advancing semi-circles, left- and right-hand quadrants, the
curves of the tracks, the probable bearing of the centre, the shifts of
wind and the readings of barometer. He tried to bring all these
things into a definite relation to himself, and ended by becoming
contemptuously angry with such a lot of words, and with so much advice,
all head-work and supposition, without a glimmer of certitude. “It's the damnedest thing, Jukes,” he said. “If a fellow was to believe

roads, intending to ply up for Bab-al-Mondub, for three reasons: First,
to ease our ground tackle, which was much decayed through long riding at
anchor in boisterous weather; second, to seek some place where we could
procure water, for which we were now much distressed; and, lastly, to
stop the passage of all the Indian ships entering the Red Sea, by which
to constrain the Turks to release our general with the people and goods. We stood over in the first place for the Abyssinian coast, where we left
the Darling to look for her anchor and cable, while with the other two
ships we plied to windward, and came to anchor in the evening on the
Arabian coast, about three leagues to windward of Mokha, and about four
miles off shore, in eight fathoms water. The 3d we set sail with the

                          THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE
                    TO THE SECOND BOOK OF THESE TALES


These are the last works of this style that  will come from the pen of
the Author, and  consequently this is the last opportunity he has of
vindicating the boldness and privilege which he has assumed. We make no
mention of villainous rhymes, of lines that run into the next, of two
vowels without elision, nor, in general, of such  kinds of carelessness
as he would not allow himself in another style of poetry, but which
are part and parcel, so to say, of this style. Too anxious a care
in avoiding such would force a tale-writer into a labyrinth of shifts,
into narratives as dull as they are grand, into straits that are utterly
useless, and would make him disregard the pleasure of the heart in order
to labour for the gratification of the ear. We must leave studied
narrative for lofty subjects, and not compose an epic poem of the
Adventures of Renaud d'Ast.",5285,1600s
"No foreign Court exulted: all plumed
themselves upon praising and honouring his memory. The Emperor wore
mourning as for a father, and although four or five months elapsed
between the death of the King and the Carnival, all kinds of amusements
were prohibited at Vienna during the Carnival, and the prohibition was
strictly observed. A monstrous fact was, that towards the end of this
period there was a single ball and a kind of fete that the Comte du Luc
our own ambassador, was not ashamed to give to the ladies, who seduced
him by the ennui of so dull a Carnival. This complaisance did not raise
him in estimation at Vienna or elsewhere. In France people were
contented with ignoring it.",3870,1600s
"Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward, we’ll put you i’

"Unlocks the heart that favours would withhold. To this the god of love has oft recourse,
          When arrows fail to reach the secret source,
          And I'll maintain he's right, for, 'mong mankind,
          Nice presents ev'ry where we pleasing find;
          Kings, princes, potentates, receive the same,
          And when a lady thinks she's not to blame,
          To do what custom tolerates around;
          When Venus' acts are only Themis' found,
          I'll nothing 'gainst her say; more faults than one,
          Besides the present, have their course begun. A MANTUAN judge espoused a beauteous fair:
          Her name was Argia:--Anselm was her care,
          An aged dotard, trembling with alarms,
          While she was young, and blessed with seraph charms. But, not content with such a pleasing prize,
          His jealousy appeared without disguise,
          Which greater admiration round her drew,
          Who doubtless merited, in ev'ry view,
          Attention from the first in rank or place
          So elegant her form, so fine her face. 'TWOULD endless prove, and nothing would avail,
          Each lover's pain minutely to detail:
          Their arts and wiles; enough 'twill be no doubt,
          To say the lady's heart was found so stout,
          She let them sigh their precious hours away,
          And scarcely seemed emotion to betray.",5281,1600s

“Very well, mother, I'll go now. I suppose it won't make any difference
if I don't come back for an hour or two.”

“No, that will be in time.”

Mrs. Frost did not ask Frank where he was going. She had perfect faith
in him, and felt sure that he would never become involved in anything
discreditable. Frank passed through the village without stopping at the store.",1573,1800s

Augustine says, as also do very many others who follow him: God

community or such a magistrate, or of my neighbour as an example to him;

suffered much more for me, though He needed not at all to do so on His
own account, and made Himself for my sake under the law, when He was
not under the law. And although tyrants may do me violence or wrong in
requiring obedience to these things, yet it will not hurt me to do them,

by Captain Warren were still in India, but he had been a great while from
the coast and had not seen them. He gave me a chart of these straits from
the Button and Cap to Batavia, and showed me the best way in thither. At
11 o'clock, it being calm, I anchored in 14 fathom good oazy ground. ARRIVAL AT BATAVIA.",15685,1600s
"It is the same
in everything; we think a difference of opinion, of conduct, of manners,
a tacit reproach, at least, upon our own; we must therefore use ourselves
to a ready conformity to whatever is neither criminal nor dishonorable. Whoever differs from any general custom, is supposed both to think, and
proclaim himself wiser than the rest of the world: which the rest of the
world cannot bear, especially in a young man. A young fellow is always
forgiven and often applauded, when he carries a fashion to an excess; but
never if he stops short of it. The first is ascribed to youth and fire;
but the latter is imputed to an affectation of singularity or
superiority. At your age, one is allowed to 'outrer' fashion, dress,
vivacity, gallantry, etc., but by no means to be behindhand in any one of
them.",3357,1600s

"This bird also will sound the alarm, and strike at
cats when they climb on the roofs of houses, or otherwise approach the
nests. Each species of hirundo drinks as it flies along, sipping the
surface of the water; but the swallow alone, in general, washes on the
wing, by dropping into a pool for many times together: in very hot
weather house-martins and bank-martins dip and wash a little. The swallow is a delicate songster, and in soft sunny weather sings
both perching and flying; on trees in a kind of concert, and on
chimney-tops: is also a bold flyer, ranging to distant downs and
commons even in windy weather, which the other species seem much to
dislike; nay, even frequenting exposed sea-port towns, and making
little excursions over the salt water. Horsemen on wide downs are often
closely attended by a little party of swallows for miles together,
which plays before and behind them, sweeping around, and collecting all
the skulking insects that are roused by the trampling of the horses’
feet: when the wind blows hard, without this expedient, they are often
forced to settle to pick up their lurking prey. This species feeds much on little coleoptera, as well as on gnats and
flies: and often settles on dug ground, or paths, for gravels to grind
and digest its food.",1408,1700s

pronounce the Epilogue made by the Author, and leave the Reader to
judge whether it deserves a Plaudite. The _Spaniards_ first set Sail to _America_, not for the Honour of God,
or as Persons moved and merited thereunto by servent Zeal to the True
Faith, nor to promote the Salvation of their Neighbours, nor to serve
the King, as they falsely boast and pretend to do, but in truth, only
stimulated and goaded on by insatiable Avarice and Ambition, that they
might for ever Domineer, Command, and Tyrannize over the _West-
Indians_, whose Kingdoms they hoped to divide and distribute among
themselves. Which to deal candidly in no more or less intentionally,
than by all these indirect wayes to disappoint and expel the Kings of
_Castile_ out of those Dominions and Territories, that they themselves
having usurped the Supreme and Regal Empire, might first challenge it
as their Right, and then possess and enjoy it. FINIS.",20321,1400s
"It hapned that after the departure of that Vessel that
brought these Religious Men, another came into the Port, whose Crew
according to their Hellish Custom, fraudulently, and unknown to the
Religious brought away a Prince of that Province as Captive, who was
call'd _Alphonsus_, (for they are ambitious of a Christian Name,) and
forthwith desire without farther Information, that he would Baptize
him: But the said Lord _Alphonsus_ was deceitfully overperswaded to go
on board of them with his Wife and about Seventeen more, pretending
that they would give hime a Collation; which the Prince and they did,
for he was confident, that the Religious would by no means suffer himo
be abus'd, for he had no so much Confidence in the _Spaniards_; but as
soon as they were upon Deck, the perfidious Rogues, set Sail for
_Hispaniola_, where they were sold as Slaves. The whole Country being
extreamly discompos'd, and understanding that their Prince and Princess
were violently carried away, addressed themselves to these Religioso's,
who were in great danger of losing their Lives: But they being made to
understand this unjust Action, were extraordinarily afflicted, and 'tis
probable would have suffered Death, rather than permit the _Indians_ to
be so injuriously dealt with, which might prove an Obstruction to their
receiving of, and believing in God's Word. Yet the _Indians_ were
sedated by the promises of the Religious; for they told them, they
would send Letters by the first Ship that was bound for _Hispaniola_,
whereby they would procure the Restitution and Return of their Lord and
his Retinue. It pleased God to send a Ship thither forthwith, to the
greater confirming of the Governours Damnation, where in the Letters
they sent to the Religious of _Hispaniola_, Letters containing repeated
Exclamations and Protestations, and protest against such Actions, but
those that received them denyed them Justice, for that they were
partakers of that Prey, made of those _Indians_ so injustly and
impiously captivated. But when the Religious, who had engag'd to the
Inhabitants, that their Lord _Alphonsus_ should be restor'd within Four
Moneths, and found that neither in Four, nor Eight Moneths he was
return'd, they prepar'd themselves for Death, and to deliver up their
Life to Christ, to whom they had offer'd it before their departure from
_Spain_: Thus the Innocent _Indians_ were revenged on the Innocent
Priests; for they were of Opinion, that the Religious had a hand in the
Plot, partly, because they found their Promises that their Lord should
return within Four Moneths, ineffectual, and partly because the
Inhabitants made no difference between a Religious Frier and a
_Spanish_ Rogue.",20321,1400s

[Footnote A: From Turtle Creek, Kerr County, Texas, after Osgood
(1909:148).] _Distribution of Peromyscus boylii in Kansas_

The subspecies _Peromyscus boylii attwateri_ is known in the state only
from Cherokee County, the southeasternmost county in the state. Probably
the only locality where the brush mouse occurs in that county is on the
systems of cliffs along Shoal Creek, southward from Galena, to the

"The clause I now read is as plainly written in the
Constitution as any other of its provisions:

    “No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws
    thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or
    regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but
    shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or
    labor may be due.”

It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who
made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the
intention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear
their support to the whole Constitution—to this provision as much as to
any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come
within the terms of this clause “shall be delivered up”, their oaths
are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could
they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of
which to keep good that unanimous oath? There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be
enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference
is not a very material one.",9,1800s

had caused Spoleto to be sacked for having, through internal factions,
fallen into rebellion. Citta di Castello being in the same state of
contumacy, he besieged that place; and Niccolo Vitelli its prince, being
on intimate terms with Lorenzo de' Medici, obtained assistance from
him, which, though inadequate, was quite enough to originate that enmity
between Sixtus IV. and the Medici afterward productive of such unhappy
results. Nor would this have been so long in development had not the
death of Frate Piero, cardinal of St. Sixtus, taken place; who, after
having traveled over Italy and visited Venice and Milan (under the
pretense of doing honor to the marriage of Ercole, marquis of Ferrara),
went about sounding the minds of the princes, to learn how they were
disposed toward the Florentines. But upon his return he died, not
without suspicion of having been poisoned by the Venetians, who found
they would have reason to fear Sixtus if he were allowed to avail
himself of the talents and exertions of Frate Piero.",2464,1400s

"This is supposing the present race of kings in the world to have
had an honorable origin; whereas it is more than probable, that could
we take off the dark covering of antiquity, and trace them to their
first rise, that we should find the first of them nothing better than
the principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage manners or
pre-eminence in subtility obtained him the title of chief among
plunderers; and who by increasing in power, and extending his
depredations, over-awed the quiet and defenceless to purchase their
safety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no idea
of giving hereditary right to his descendants, because such a
perpetual exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free and
unrestrained principles they professed to live by. Wherefore,
hereditary succession in the early ages of monarchy could not take
place as a matter of claim, but as something casual or complimental;
but as few or no records were extant in those days, and traditionary
history stuffed with fables, it was very easy, after the lapse of a
few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently
timed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the
vulgar. Perhaps the disorders which threatened, or seemed to
threaten, on the decease of a leader and the choice of a new one (for
elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at
first to favor hereditary pretensions; by which means it happened, as
it hath happened since, that what at first was submitted to as a
convenience, was afterwards claimed as a right. England, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs, but
groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones; yet no man in his

markets by a brilliant action, in which the French chivalry was found
powerless against the English yeoman-archers; and in 1338 Edward crossed
over to Antwerp to see what forward movement could be made. The other
frontier war was that of Brittany, which began a little later (1341). The
openings of the war were gloomy and wasteful, without glory. Edward did
not actually send defiance to Philip till 1339, when he proclaimed
himself King of France, and quartered the lilies of France on the royal
shield. The Flemish proved a very reed; and though the French army came

according to his custom, when he received any indignity which he durst
not revenge, began to sing a Welsh ditty. I guessed he was under some agitation of spirits and desired to know
the cause; but, instead of answering me directly, he asked with great
emotion, if I thought him a monster and a stinkard? “A monster and a
stinkard!” said I, with some surprise: “did anybody call you so?” “Cot

CHAPTER XXXV


Captain Whiffle sends for me—his situation described—his surgeon
arrives, prescribes for him, and puts him to bed—a bed is put up for
Mr. Simper contiguous to the state room, which, with other parts of the
captains behaviour, gives the ship’s company a very unfavourable idea
of their commander—I am detained in the West Indies by the admiral, and
go on board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeon’s mate,
where I make myself known to the surgeon, who treats me very kindly—I
go on shore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and, at my return on
board, am surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed
lieutenant of the sloop—we sail on a cruise—take a prize in which I
arrive at Port Morant under the command of my messmate, with whom I
live in great harmony


He was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a

"His ballades are generally
thin and scanty of import; for the ballade presented too large a canvas,
and he was preoccupied by technical requirements. But in the rondel he
has put himself before all competitors by a happy knack and a prevailing
distinction of manner. He is very much more of a duke in his verses than
in his absurd and inconsequential career as a statesman; and how he shows
himself a duke is precisely by the absence of all pretension, turgidity,
or emphasis. He turns verses, as he would have come into the king’s
presence, with a quiet accomplishment of grace. Théodore de Banville, the youngest poet of a famous generation now nearly

those primitive Christians were led, who joined sobriety to so
recluse a life. By living, like them, to the age of one hundred and
twenty, they might, like them, expect, by the power of God, to work

"Any man possessing this knowledge may easily keep clear of danger among
those innumerable commands and precepts of the Pope, of bishops, of
monasteries, of churches, of princes, and of magistrates, which some
foolish pastors urge on us as being necessary for justification and
salvation, calling them precepts of the Church, when they are not so
at all. For the Christian freeman will speak thus: I will fast, I will
pray, I will do this or that which is commanded me by men, not as having
any need of these things for justification or salvation, but that I
may thus comply with the will of the Pope, of the bishop, of such a
community or such a magistrate, or of my neighbour as an example to him;
for this cause I will do and suffer all things, just as Christ did and
suffered much more for me, though He needed not at all to do so on His
own account, and made Himself for my sake under the law, when He was
not under the law. And although tyrants may do me violence or wrong in
requiring obedience to these things, yet it will not hurt me to do them,
so long as they are not done against God. From all this every man will be able to attain a sure judgment and
faithful discrimination between all works and laws, and to know who
are blind and foolish pastors, and who are true and good ones. For
whatsoever work is not directed to the sole end either of keeping under
the body, or of doing service to our neighbour--provided he require
nothing contrary to the will of God--is no good or Christian work.",1911,1400s

"Lambert, who
had hastened northward to encounter the army of Scotland, was abandoned
by his troops, and became a prisoner. During thirteen years the civil
power had, in every conflict, been compelled to yield to the military
power. The military power now humbled itself before the civil power. The Rump, generally hated and despised, but still the only body in the

of which he prudently withdrew his spouse, without attempting to
continue the war of tongues, in which she had shown such a decided

"They
next sent advocates to Florence, and the question was referred to the
consideration of certain citizens, who, either through being bribed by
the party in possession, or from a sincere conviction, declared the
aim of the people of Volterra to be unjust in desiring to deprive their
citizens of the fruit of their labor; and decided that the alum-pit was
the rightful property of those who had hitherto wrought it; but, at
the same time, recommended them to pay an annual sum by way of
acknowledgment to the city. This answer instead of abating, served only
to increase the animosities and tumult in Volterra, and absorbed entire
attention both in the councils and throughout the city; the people
demanding the restitution of what they considered their due, and
the proprietors insisting upon their right to retain what they had
originally acquired, and what had been subsequently been confirmed
to them by the decision of the Florentines. In the midst of these
disturbances, a respectable citizen, named Il Pecorino, was killed,
together with several others, who had embraced the same side, whose
houses were also plundered and burned; and the fury of the mob rose to
such a height, that they were with difficulty restrained from putting
the Florentine rectors to death. After the first outrage, the Volterrani immediately determined to send
ambassadors to Florence, who intimated, that if the Signory would allow
them their ancient privileges, the city would remain subject to them as
formerly. Many and various were the opinions concerning the reply to be
made.",2464,1400s

can be transmitted. I consider this question ridiculous, and will prove
it so. It is my contention that such 'life force' is not a thing apart
from the physical shell.""",59693,1900s
". Then a deathly spell on the watchers fell --
      God! it was still, that place! He raised the head of the careless Dead;
      He fumbled a vagrant curl;

"In
this matter we must listen to Scripture, which teaches us to turn aside
neither to the right hand nor to the left, but to follow those right
precepts of the Lord which rejoice the heart. For just as a man is
not righteous merely because he serves and is devoted to works and
ceremonial rites, so neither will he be accounted righteous merely
because he neglects and despises them. It is not from works that we are set free by the faith of Christ, but
from the belief in works, that is from foolishly presuming to seek
justification through works. Faith redeems our consciences, makes them
upright, and preserves them, since by it we recognise the truth that
justification does not depend on our works, although good works neither
can nor ought to be absent, just as we cannot exist without food and
drink and all the functions of this mortal body. Still it is not on them
that our justification is based, but on faith; and yet they ought not
on that account to be despised or neglected.",1911,1400s
"My Emily’s
spinnet stood at the end of it, open, with a book of music folded down at
some of my favourite lessons. I touched the keys; there was a vibration
in the sound that froze my blood; I looked around, and methought the
family pictures on the walls gazed on me with compassion in their faces. I sat down again with an attempt at more composure; I started at every
creaking of the door, and my ears rung with imaginary noises! “I had not remained long in this situation, when the arrival of a friend,
who had accidentally heard of my return, put an end to my doubts, by the
recital of my daughter’s dishonour. He told me he had his information
from a young gentleman, to whom Winbrooke had boasted of having seduced
her.",5083,1700s
"Nor
would they trespass against their rules; they would rather improve
upon them; since every religious community allows its subjects
bread, wine, and sometimes eggs (some of them allow meat) besides
soups made with vegetables, sallets, fruit, and cakes, things which
often disagree with them, and even shorten their lives. But, as
they are allowed such things by their rules, they freely make use of
them; thinking, perhaps, that it would be wrong to abstain from
them, whereas it would not. It would rather be commendable, if,
after the age of thirty, they abstained from such food, confined
themselves to bread, wine, broths and eggs: for this is the true
method of preserving men of a bad constitution; and it is a life of
more indulgence than that led by the holy fathers of the desart,
who subsisted intirely on wild fruits and roots, and drank nothing
but pure water; and, nevertheless, lived, as I have already
mentioned, in good health and spirits, and always happy within
themselves. Were those of our days to do the same, they would,
like them, find the road to heaven much easier; for it is always
open to every faithful Christian, as our Saviour Jesus Christ left
it, when he came down upon earth to shed his precious blood, in
order to deliver us from the tyrannical servitude of the devil; and
all through his immense goodness. So that, to make an end of this discourse, I say, that since length
of days abounds with so many favours and blessings, and I happen to
be one of those who are arrived at that state, I cannot (as I would
not willingly want charity) but give testimony in favour of it,
and solemnly assure all mankind, that I really enjoy a great deal
more than what I now mention; and that I have no other reason for
writing, but that of demonstrating the great advantages which arise
from longevity, to the end that their own conviction may induce them
to observe those excellent rules of temperance and sobriety.",30660,1400s
"O, if thou hadst ever readmitted Adam into
Paradise, how abstinently would he have walked by that tree! And would
not the angels that fell have fixed themselves upon thee, if thou hadst
once readmitted them to thy sight? They never relapsed; if I do, must
not my case be as desperate? Not so desperate; for _as thy majesty, so
is thy mercy_,[343] both infinite; and thou, who hast commanded me to
pardon my brother seventy-seven times, hast limited thyself to no
number. If death were ill in itself, thou wouldst never have raised any
dead man to life again, because that man must necessarily die again.",23772,1500s

a modest heat glow’d freshly on his Cheeks. Aurelian waited with a
pleasing Admiration the discovery promised him, when the Youth still
struggling with his Resolution, with a timorous haste, pulled off a
Peruke which had concealed the most beautiful abundance of Hair that
ever graced one Female Head; those dishevelled spreading tresses, as at
first they made a discovery of, so at last they served for a veil to

"He was exactly five feet six
inches in height and six feet five inches in circumference. His head was
a perfect sphere, and of such stupendous dimensions, that Dame Nature,
with all her sex's ingenuity, would have been puzzled to construct a neck
capable of supporting it; wherefore, she wisely declined the attempt, and
settled it firmly on the top of his backbone; just between the shoulders. His body was oblong and particularly capacious at bottom, which was wisely
ordered by Providence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits, and
very averse to the idle labor of walking. His legs were short, but sturdy in proportion to the weight they had to
sustain; so that, when erect, he had not a little the appearance of a beer
barrel on skids. His face, that infallible index of the mind, presented a
vast expanse, unfurrowed by any of those lines and angles which disfigure
the human countenance with what is termed expression.",13042,1700s
"Accordingly, as the carriage drew abreast of her in climbing the long
ascent, she walked close to the wheels, the rays of the nearest lamp
penetrating her very pores. She had only just dropped behind when the
carriage stopped, and to her surprise the coachman asked her, over his
shoulder, if she would ride. What made the question more surprising was
that it came in obedience to an order from the interior of the vehicle. Marty gladly assented, for she was weary, very weary, after working all
night and keeping afoot all day. She mounted beside the coachman,
wondering why this good-fortune had happened to her.",482,1800s

approximate date (July, 1527), before Anne's return to court. Henry's
passion must date therefore from 1526. The 7th is fixed by references in
other correspondence to February, 1528, and the 8th to June before she
left the court. The 9th, 10th and 11th relate to the sweating sickness

"“By authority of the right reverend Lord Abbot of Unreason.”

[Footnote: We learn from no less authority than that of Napoleon
Bonaparte, that there is but a single step between the sublime and
ridiculous; and it is a transition from one extreme to another; so very
easy, that the vulgar of every degree are peculiarly captivated with it. Thus the inclination to laugh becomes uncontrollable, when the solemnity
and gravity of time, place, and circumstances, render it peculiarly
improper. Some species of general license, like that which inspired the
ancient Saturnalia, or the modern Carnival, has been commonly indulged
to the people at all times and in almost all countries. But it was, I
think, peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church, that while they studied
how to render their church rites imposing and magnificent, by all that
pomp, music, architecture, and external display could add to them, they
nevertheless connived, upon special occasions, at the frolics of the
rude vulgar, who, in almost all Catholic countries, enjoyed, or at least
assumed, the privilege of making: some Lord of the revels, who, under
the name of the Abbot of Unreason, the Boy Bishop, or the President
of Fools, occupied the churches, profaned the holy places by a mock
imitation of the sacred rites, and sung indecent parodies on hymns of
the church. The indifference of the clergy, even when their power was
greatest, to the indecent exhibitions which they always tolerated, and
sometimes encouraged, forms a strong contrast to the sensitiveness with
which they regarded any serious attempt, by preaching or writing, to
impeach any of the doctrines of the church.",6407,1700s

great account in the days of apostasy, but now of repute with the best of
the town. This man, therefore, they were willing to prefer. Now Mr.

"It has been my settled principle, that
the reading of the ancient books is probably true, and therefore
is not to be disturbed for the sake of elegance, perspicuity, or
mere improvement of the sense. For though much credit is not due
to the fidelity, nor any to the judgement of the first publishers,
yet they who had the copy before their eyes were more likely to
read it right, than we who only read it by imagination. But it is
evident that they have often made strange mistakes by ignorance or
negligence, and that therefore something may be properly attempted by
criticism, keeping the middle way between presumption and timidity. Such criticism I have attempted to practise, and where any passage
appeared inextricably perplexed, have endeavoured to discover how
it may be recalled to sense, with least violence. But my first labour
is, always to turn the old text on every side, and try if there
be any interstice, through which light can find its way; nor would
Huetius himself condemn me, as refusing the trouble of research,

"A brief instant later the snapping of wood fibres began like the rapid
explosions of infantry fire; a crash and bang of timbers smote the air;
and then the river, exultant, roaring with joy, rushed from its pent
quietude into the new passage opened for it. At the same moment, as
though at the signal, a single bird, premonitor of the yet distant day,
lifted up his voice, clearly audible above the tumult. Orde stormed into the camp up stream, his eyes bright, his big voice
booming exultantly. “Roll out, you river-hogs!” he shouted to those who had worked out their
shifts earlier in the night. “Roll out, you web-footed sons of guns, and
hear the little birds sing praise!”

Newmark, who had sat up the night through, and now shivered sleepily by

"From them I
gathered that the greater part of the property bequeathed by the
Worshipful Master Richard Watts for the maintenance of this foundation
was, at the period of his death, mere marsh-land; but that, in course of
time, it had been reclaimed and built upon, and was very considerably
increased in value. I found, too, that about a thirtieth part of the
annual revenue was now expended on the purposes commemorated in the
inscription over the door; the rest being handsomely laid out in
Chancery, law expenses, collectorship, receivership, poundage, and other
appendages of management, highly complimentary to the importance of the
six Poor Travellers. In short, I made the not entirely new discovery
that it may be said of an establishment like this, in dear old England,
as of the fat oyster in the American story, that it takes a good many men
to swallow it whole. ""And pray, ma'am,"" said I, sensible that the blankness of my face began

"Whereat the Lord
 God is highly offended and the King hath very ill Offices done him, for
 he is hereby defrauded of this Region, which was sufficiently able to
 furnish all _Castile_ with Necessaries, the Recovery whereof can never
 be expected without great difficulty and vast Expenses. Thus far I have acquainted you with the very words of this Religious
_Franciscan_, ratified by the Bishop of _Mexico_, who testifieth that
the said Frier _Marc_ did affirm and maintain what is above-mentioned. Here it is to be observ'd what this said Frier was an Eye-Witness of;
for he travelled up in this Countrey Fifty or a Hundred Miles, for the
space of Nine or Ten Years, when as yet, few _Spaniards_ had got
footing there, but afterward, at the noise of Gold to be had there in
great plenty, Four or Five Thousand came thither, who spread themselves
through those Kingdoms and Provinces the space of Five or Six Hundred
Miles, which they made wholly desloate, committing the same, or greater
Cruelies than are before recited; for in reality they destroyed from
that time to these very days, above an Hundred Thousand poor Souls more
than he gives an Account of, and with less fear of God and the King,
nay with less Mercy have they destroyed the greatest part of Mankind in
these Kingdoms, above Four Millions suffering by violent Death. A few days after they darted to Death with Arrows made of Reeds a
Puissant Queen, the Wife of a Potentate, who still sways the Imperial
Scepter of that Kingdom, whom the _Spaniards_ had a design to take,
which instigated him to raise a Rebellion, and he still continues a
Rebel. They seized the Queen his Consort, and contrary to all Law and
Equity murdered her, as is said before, who was then, as report, big
with Child, only for this Reason, that they might add fresh Affliction
and Grief to her Husband.",20321,1400s

these twelve years the Spaniards have destroyed in the Said Countinent,

under that word they mask their Cruel Actions) or rather those of the
Turk himself, which are reported of them, tending to the ruin of the
Catholick Cause, together with their Invasions and Unjust Wars,
contrarty to and condemned by Divine as well as Human Laws; nor are
they reckoned in this number who perished by their more then _Egyptian_
Bondage and usual Oppressions. There is no Tongue, Art, or Human knowledge can recite the horrid
Impieties, which these Capital Enemies to Government and all Mankind
have been guilty of at several times and in several Nations; nor can
the circumstantial Aggravations of some of their wicked Acts be
unfolded or display'd by any manner of Industry, time or writing, but
yet I will say somewhat of every individual particular thing, which

City of _Cholula_, which consisted of Thirty Thousand Families; all the
Chief Rulers of that Region and Neighboring places, but first the
Priests with their High Priest going to meet the Spaniards in Pomp and
State, and to the end they might give them a more reverential and
honourable reception appointed them to be in the middle of the
Solemnity, that so being entertained in the Appartments of the most
powerful and principal Noblemen, they might be lodged in the City. The
Spaniards presently consult about their slaughter or castigation (as
they term it) that they might fill every corner of this Region by their
Cruelties and wicked Deeds with terror and consternation; for in all
the Countries that they came they took this course, that immediately at
their first arrival they committed some notorious butcheries, which
made those Innocent Sheep tremble for fear.",20321,1400s

That made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the same he was born
hoggish after money and didn’t like to let go a cent; so he begun to
whine and explain, and said times was hard, and although he had took a
full freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn’t git
no return freight, and so he warn’t making no great things out of his
trip. So the dervish starts along again, and says:

“All right, if you want to take the risk; but I reckon you’ve made a
mistake this time, and missed a chance.”

Of course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had
missed, because maybe there was money in it; so he run after the
dervish, and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at
last the dervish gave in, and says:

“Do you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures
of the earth, and I was looking around for a man with a particular good
kind heart and a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find
just that man, I’ve got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and
he could see the treasures and get them out.”

[Illustration: “The camel-driver in the treasure-cave”]

So then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he cried, and begged, and
took on, and went down on his knees, and said he was just that kind of
a man, and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he
wasn’t ever described so exact before. “Well, then,” says the dervish, “all right.",91,1800s
"TAMORA. My lovely Aaron, wherefore look’st thou sad

And make a chequered shadow on the ground. Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,

Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
As if a double hunt were heard at once,
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;

When with a happy storm they were surprised,

I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with
excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of
the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been
supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished
future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient
gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such
as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my
head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the
public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that
when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take
stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already
committed to a profound duplicity of life.",43,1800s

"The intoxicating powers of spirits are diminished by the addition of
vegetable acids, or substances which contain oxygen, which will
counteract the effects of the hydrogen. Thus it is known that the
same quantity of spirit, made into punch, will not produce either the
same ebriety, or the same subsequent exhaustion, as when simply mixed
with water. Recollect however that I propose this only as a hypothesis: its truth
may be confirmed by future observations and experiments, or it may be
refuted by them: but it is certainly capable of explaining many of
the phenomena, which is one of the conditions required by Newton's
first rule of philosophizing. Heat, and light, and other stimuli, may perhaps exhaust the
excitability, by facilitating the combination of oxygen in the fibres
with the hydrogen and carbon in the blood. There are several substances which cause a diminution or exhaustion
of the excitability, without producing any previous increased
excitement.",27748,1700s

establish perfect equality among them, the monarch, and, after his
example, the other members of this society, dropt their own and adopted
other names. Angelbert was called Homer, from his partiality to that
poet; Riculphus, archbishop of Mentz, chose the name of Damétas, from an
eclogue of Virgil: another member took that of Candidus; Eginhard, the
Emperor's biographer, was called Calliopus, from the Muse Calliope;
Alcuin received, from his country, the name of Albinus; the archbishop
Theodulfe was called Pindar; the abbot Adelard was called Augustine;
Charlemagne, as the man of God's own heart, was called David. [Sidenote: 800-911]

The Emperor corresponded with men of learning, on subjects of
literature; they generally related to religion. In one of his letters,
he requires of Alcuin an explanation of the words Septuagesima,
Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima, which denote the Sundays which
immediately precede, and the word Quadragesima, which denotes the first
Sunday which occurs in Lent. The denominations of those Sundays give
rise to two difficulties; one, that they seem to imply that each week
consists of ten, not of seven days; the other, that the words sound as
if Septuagesima were the seventieth, when it is only the sixty-third day
before Easter Sunday; Sexagesima, as if it were the sixtieth, when it is

Titus had given them. 7  At length they saw a man coming

handsome legs, hollow-eyes; and a

 provocation on their part, as soon as they entred upon these
 Territories, did burn at the Stake their most Potent _Caciq Ataliba_,
 Prince of the whole Country, after they had extorted from him above Two
 Millions of Gold, and possessed themselves of his Province, without the
 least Opposition: and _Cochilimaca_, his Captain General, who with
 other Rulers, came peaceably into them, follow'd him by the same fiery
 Tryal and Death. As also some few days after, the Ruler of the
 Province of _Quitonia_, who was burnt, without any Cause given, or
 Crime laid to his Charge. They likewise put _Schapera_, Prince of the
 _Canaries_ to the same Death, and in like manner, burnt the Feet of
 _Alvidis_, the greatest of all the _Quitonian_ Lords, and rackt him
 with other Torments to Extract from him a discovery of _Ataliba's_
 Treasure, whereof as appear'd after, he was totally ignorant. Thus
 they treated _Cocopaganga_, Governour of all the Provinces of
 _Quitonia_, who being overcome with the Intreaties of _Sebastian
 Bernalcarus_, the Governours Captain, went peaceably to pay them a
 Visit; but because he could not give them as much Gold as they
 demanded, they burnt him with many other _Casics_ and Chief Persons of
 Quality. And as I understnad, did it with this evil Intention, that

ceased to be a necessary human state, and only the absence of any
collective intelligence and an imagined need for tough and
unintelligent soldiers and for a prolific class at a low level,
prevented its systematic replacement at that time....

And while this settlement of the country was in progress, the urban
camps of the first phase of the council’s activities were rapidly
developing, partly through the inherent forces of the situation and
partly through the council’s direction, into a modern type of town.... Section 6

It is characteristic of the manner in which large enterprises forced
themselves upon the Brissago council, that it was not until the end of
the first year of their administration and then only with extreme
reluctance that they would take up the manifest need for a _lingua
franca_ for the world. They seem to have given little attention to the
various theoretical universal languages which were proposed to them. They wished to give as little trouble to hasty and simple people as
possible, and the world-wide distribution of English gave them a bias
for it from the beginning. The extreme simplicity of its grammar was
also in its favour.",1059,1800s

imaginary Glory, rational Dreams and Visions, Revelations, Inspirations,
Experiences, or Voices proceeding from an incomprehensible Spirit. Again, I have both read and heard a Voice to say, that the Secrets of
the Lord are his Choice Treasures, reserved only for Redeemed ones; but
I never read or heard from any Spiritual wise Man before now, that any
Satanical Spirit was able to intellect deceived Persons, exactly to
write of the hidden Mysteries of the Everlasting God. Again, you pretend
unto no such Revelations as I proceed upon, but say you, there is
another Way more certain than Reason or Revelation, which whether as I
presume you were led into, the Lord will one Day make manifest, from the

of the composition of the present Assembly deputed by them, (in which
Assembly there are not quite fifty persons possessed of an income
amounting to 100_l._ sterling yearly,) must discern clearly, _that the
political and civil power of France is wholly separated from its
property of every description_, and of course that neither the landed
nor the moneyed interest possesses the smallest weight or consideration
in the direction of any public concern. The whole kingdom is directed by
_the refuse of its chicane_, with the aid of the bustling, presumptuous
young clerks of counting-houses and shops, and some intermixture of
young gentlemen of the same character in the several towns. The rich
peasants are bribed with Church lands; and the poorer of that

"For gradually
more holy-days were made, fasts appointed, new ceremonies and services
in honor of saints instituted, because the authors of such things
thought that by these works they were meriting grace. Thus in times past
the Penitential Canons increased, whereof we still see some traces in
the satisfactions. Again, the authors of traditions do contrary to the command of God when
they find matters of sin in foods, in days, and like things, and burden
the Church with bondage of the law, as if there ought to be among
Christians, in order to merit justification a service like the
Levitical, the arrangement of which God had committed to the Apostles
and bishops. For thus some of them write; and the Pontiffs in some
measure seem to be misled by the example of the law of Moses. Hence are
such burdens, as that they make it mortal sin, even without offense
to others, to do manual labor on holy-days, a mortal sin to omit the
Canonical Hours, that certain foods defile the conscience that fastings
are works which appease God that sin in a reserved case cannot be
forgiven but by the authority of him who reserved it; whereas the Canons
themselves speak only of the reserving of the ecclesiastical penalty,
and not of the reserving of the guilt.",275,1400s

the ingredients. Next sift the flour, powder the sugar, pound or grind
the spice, and prepare the fruit; afterwards mix and stir the butter
and sugar, and lastly beat the eggs; as, if allowed to stand any time,
they will fall and become heavy. When all the ingredients are mixed
together, they should be stirred very hard at the last; and (unless
there is yeast in the cake) the sooner it is put into the oven the
better. While baking, no air should be admitted to it, except for a
moment, now and then, when it is necessary to examine if it is baking
properly, For baking; cakes, the best guide is practice and experience;

occurred during the treatment of several hundred patients. As a knowledge
of the structure, and functions of the body, have been held indispensably
necessary in order to become acquainted with its diseases, and to a
scientific mode of treating them; so it would appear, that he who proposes
to write on Madness should be well informed concerning the powers and

of the brain, and more especially respecting its consistence in maniacal
disorders, I have been induced to examine that viscus in those who have
died insane, and have endeavoured with accuracy to report the

"This is a sufficient _Encomium_ of Riding, coming from the
Mouth of one of the Ancients, who relied so much upon other Exercises,
tho’ we in these Northern Parts want no Recommendation from them, of a
thing so much experienc’d by our selves; only we slight and neglect this
Advantage, as we do many others, because it is common. I have now with sufficient Brevity, consider’d how much the Ancients
depended on the Assistance of Exercises in their Practice; and I leave
it to any one, that is not prejudic’d, to judge whether this may not
pass for one Reason, why they cur’d so well with so bad a Theory, and
such indifferent Materials; when we, with our Circulation and Splendid
Pharmacy, are not perhaps able to outdo ’em proportionably to our larger
Acquisition of Knowledge; I say, I think this may be one Reason, for
I know there is another may be alledg’d likewise, and I think I speak
without any undue Aggravation. The Power of Exercises us’d at proper Seasons, and with great and exact
Patience, must needs be very great; and if it be true, that in the
_Roman_ Common Wealth there was no profess’d Physician for the first Five
Hundred Years, there is no way to account for it but by their incredible
Temperance, and Variety of Exercises; the few Chronical Distempers they
had among ’em, were in all likelyhood, for the most part subsequent to
Acute Distempers, which no Temperance can always prevent, and the little
vegetable Physick, which they could not but know, with their resolute
and indefatigable Application to some of their Exercises, might suffice
to help ’em to get clear of ’em. This may perhaps by some be thought
rather a Gloss than an Argument, who do no duly consider their wonderful
Patience in this respect; the _Pletherismus_, and _Pitylismus_, two odd
uncouth Exercises mention’d by _Galen_, are sufficient to convince any
Man, that they that would heartily drudge at them in the middle of the
_Stadium_, would do any thing that was possible to recover their Health,
and might expect the very utmost Benefit that could be obtain’d from the
various Motion of the whole, or any part of the Body. I will grant, that they carried these things too far, the whole Education
of the _Athletæ_ was blameable; I will grant likewise that they were
too Nice in the Exercises for the Preservation of Health; I can’t

"Philip V. himself wrote to the Provincial of Paraguay on this occasion
asking him to send troops to the defence of the city. In 1785 four thousand Guaranís, commanded by Don Baltazar Garcia, were
at the second siege of the Colonia del Sacramento. Funes says of them:
‘A juicio de un testigo ocular, no es menos admirable la sangre fria de
sus capellanes.’

[193] ‘Perro Luterano’. It is astonishing how in Spain the
comparatively innocuous Luther has fallen heir to the heritage of
hatred that should more properly have belonged to the inhuman and
treacherous Calvin. [194] Philip V. in 1745, after an examination which lasted six years,
approved of all the actions of the Jesuits in Paraguay (Cretineau Joly,
‘Histoire de la Compagnie de Jésus’, vol.",1479,1800s
"_The Reformed
School_ was a basic presentation of the ideas of Comenius, Hartlib, and
Dury for transforming the nature of education in such a way that from
infancy people would be directed in their striving toward universal
knowledge and spiritual betterment. The _Supplement to the Reformed
School_ deals with the role that universities should take in preparing
for the Kingdom of God, a role making them more actively part of the
world. Having placed educational institutions in the scheme of things
preparatory to the millennium, Dury then proceeds to place library
keeping and libraries in this scheme as well. Unfortunately, according
to Dury, library keepers had traditionally regarded their positions as
opportunities for profit and gain, not for ""the service, which is to bee
don by them unto the Common-wealth of Israel, for the advancement of
Pietie and Learning"" (p. 15). Library keepers ""ought to becom Agents for
the advancement of universal Learning"" and not just mercenary people (p.
17).",15199,1500s
"I instantly saw that something was the matter; his
complexion was raised, and he spoke with great emotion; you know his
eager manner, my dear mother, when his mind is interested. “Catherine,”
said he, “I am going home to-day; I am sorry to leave you, but I must
go: it is a great while since I have seen my father and mother. I am
going to send James forward with my hunters immediately; if you have
any letter, therefore, he can take it. I shall not be at home myself
till Wednesday or Thursday, as I shall go through London, where I have
business; but before I leave you,” he continued, speaking in a lower
tone, and with still greater energy, “I must warn you of one thing—do
not let Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin. He wants to
marry her; her mother promotes the match, but she cannot endure the
idea of it.",946,1700s
"And, because they find themselves
unable to digest the great quantity of food, with which they must
load their stomachs, by eating twice in the four and twenty hours,
they make a resolution to eat but once, that the long interval
between one meal and the other may enable them to eat at one sitting
as much as they used to do in two: thus they eat till their
stomachs, overburthened with much food, pall, and sicken, and change
the superfluous food into bad humours, which kill a man before his
time. I never knew any person, who led that kind of life, live to
be very old. All these old men I have been speaking of would live
long, if, as they advanced in years, they lessened the quantity of
their food, and eat oftener, but little at a time; for old
stomachs cannot digest large quantities of food; old men changing,
in that respect, to children, who eat several times in the four and
twenty hours. Others say, that temperance may, indeed, keep a man in health, but
that it cannot prolong his life. To this I answer, that experience
proves the contrary; and that I myself am a living instance of it.",30660,1400s
"He will send for the police. There is no one in the world I shall be so glad to see!”

Ford considered that running over roofs, even when their pitfalls were
not concealed by a yellow fog, was an awkward exercise, and decided that
before he made his dash for freedom, the part of a careful jockey would
be to take a preliminary canter over the course. Accordingly, among
party walls of brick, rain-pipes, chimney-pipes, and telephone wires,
he felt his way to the wall of the apartment house; and then, with a
clearer idea of the obstacles to be avoided, raced back to the point
whence he had started. Next, to discover the exact position of the fire-escape, he dropped to
his knees and crawled to the rear edge of the roof. The light from the
back windows of the fourth floor showed him an iron ladder from the edge
of the roof to the platform of the fire-escape, and the platform itself,
stretching below the windows the width of the building.",1807,1800s
"Though all are
agreed, that intemperance is the offspring of gluttony, and sober
living of abstemiousness; the former, nevertheless, is considered
a virtue and a mark of distinction, and the latter, as dishonourable
and the badge of avarice. Such mistaken notions are entirely
owing to the power of custom, established by our senses and
irregular appetites; these have blinded and besotted men to such
a degree, that, leaving the paths of virtue, they have followed
those of vice, which lead them before their time to an old age,
burthened with strange and mortal infirmities, so as to render
them quite decrepid before forty, contrary to the effects of
sobriety, which, before it was banished by this destructive
intemperance, used to keep men sound and hearty to the age of
eighty and upwards. O wretched and unhappy Italy! do you not
see, that intemperance murders every year more of your subjects,
than you could lose by the most cruel plague, or by fire and
sword in many battles? Those truly shameful feasts, no so much
in fashion, and so intolerably profuse, that no tables are large
enough to hold the dishes, which renders it necessary to heap them
one upon another; those feasts, I say, are so many battles; and
how is it possible to support nature by such a variety of contrary
and unwholesome foods?",30660,1400s
"16. Hell, purgatory, and heaven seem to differ as do despair,
almost-despair, and the assurance of safety. 17. With souls in purgatory it seems necessary that horror should grow
less and love increase. 18.",274,1400s
"If it was good for him, it was good for them to be
permitted these means of extorting; and if it ought at all to be
practised, they ought to be admitted to extort for the good of the
Company. Rajah Nobkissin was one of the men from whom he interdicted
them to receive bribes, and from whom he received a bribe for his own
use. But he says he concealed it from them, because he thought great
mischief might happen even from their suspicion of it, and lest they
should thereby be inclined themselves to practise it, and to break their
oaths. You take it, then, for granted that he really concealed it from them? No
such thing.",18192,1700s

"GWENDOLINE. [_Taking her by the chin shall say thus_.] Yes, damsel, yes; Sabren shall surely die,
Though all the world should seek to save her life;
And not a common death shall Sabren die,
But after strange and grievous punishments
Shortly inflicted upon thy bastard’s head,
Thou shalt be cast into the cursed streams,
And feed the fishes with thy tender flesh. SABREN. And thinkst thou then, thou cruel homicide,
That these thy deeds shall be unpunished?",1548,1500s
"""And have you mentioned t his to the podestà?"" inquired Benedetta, who
stood with the empty flask in her hand, listening to the discourse; ""I
should think that sail would open his eyes."" ""I cannot say I have; but then I told him so many other things more to
the point, that he cannot do less than believe this, when he hears it. Signor Viti promised to meet me here, after he has had a conversation
with the vice-governatore; and we may now expect him every minute."" ""Il Signor Podestà will be welcome,"" said Benedetta, wiping off a spare
table, and bustling round the room to make things look a little smarter
than they ordinarily did; ""he may frequent grander wine-houses than
this, but he will hardly find better liquor.""",11957,1700s
"However, other buildings were contemplated. On February 20,
1736, the Assembly reserved the lots on Chestnut Street at the corners
of Fifth and Sixth Streets for the erection of a city hall and county
courthouse within the next 20 years, but these buildings were not
constructed until several years after the Revolution. _Two Centuries of Independence Hall_

    Hamilton. The elevation of the main building shows it substantially
    as first built. A skimpy plan like this seems inadequate to people

    drawings.",60572,1900s
"He

No answer. The question was repeated, with the same result. To be

"The _Senecaa Indians_ in their War Dress may appear as terrible as any
of the Sons of _Anak_. The _Usherees_, _Shuterees_, and _Cherackees_ are
full as formidable as the _Hittites_, _Jebusites_, and _Amalakites_; and
a _Tuskaroodau_ is as savage and strange as any _Canaanite_, that dwelt
by the Sea; and a _Pomunkee_, _Sapony_, or _Sugarr_ is as fierce and
frightful as any _Amorite_ that dwelt upon or beyond the Mountains; and
_Powhatan_, _Oppechancanough_ and _Wickmaunatauchee_ have fought many
Battles not unlike _Og_, _Sihon_, and _Chederlaomer_. In my mean Judgment it seems not improbable that when _Noah_ had cursed
the Posterity of _Ham_, and reserved different blessings for _Shem_ and
_Japheth_, God set a distinguishing Colour upon their Bodies, and
ingrafted in their Nature various Tempers, and endowed them with
separate Talents. From whence their Posterity are of three different
Complexions and Countenances, as is apparent in _White_, _Black_, and
_Brown_ People, which by Mixtures, or from Climates or otherwise are
subdivided: Particularly the _brown_ Children of _Shem_ have two
peculiar Aspects different from each other, and distinct from all the
rest; one proper to the _Jews_, the Sons of _Peleg_, and the other

The Hermen-street going northward from Lincoln is scarce diminished,
because its materials are hard stone, and the heath on both sides
favours it: three miles off, near a watering-place, a branch divides
from it with an obtuse angle to the left, which goes towards Yorkshire. We suppose the Romans at first had an erroneous idea of the island of
Britain, and thought its northern parts in a more easterly longitude
than by experience they found; and thus in Ptolemy’s maps the length
of Scotland is represented running out enormously that way: but when
Agricola, in his conquests northward, had discovered that mistake,
and that the passage over the Humber was very incommodious for the
march of soldiers, he struck out this new road, as another branch of
the Hermen-street, by way of Doncaster, from thence observing its
natural direction northward. When we turn ourselves here, and look
back to Lincoln, we see the road butts upon the western spires of the
cathedral: and when from thence you survey the road, it is an agreeable
prospect; your eye being in the middle line of its whole length to the

are.” She saw the effort with which he spoke Katharine’s name, and
believed that he forced himself to make amends now for his concealment
in the past. At any rate, she was conscious of no anger against him;
but rather of a deep pity for one condemned to suffer as she had

more strongly built than I, he succeeded in drawing me with him to the
ground. We fell together with a heavy crash, tugging and straining in
what we were both conscious was a mortal struggle. At length I succeeded

spate, like coffee covered with scald cream, while the fish are swirling
at your fly as an oar-blade swirls in a boat-race, or flashing up the
cataract like silver arrows, out of the fiercest of the foam; or whether
the fall be dwindled to a single thread, and the shingle below be as
white and dusty as a turnpike road, while the salmon huddle together in

rain creeps back again off the sea. You will not care much, if you have

water-ouzel piping on the stones, and watch the yellow roes come down to
drink and look up at you with their great soft trustful eyes, as much as
to say, “You could not have the heart to shoot at us?”  And then, if you
have sense, you will turn and talk to the great giant of a gilly who lies
basking on the stone beside you. He will tell you no fibs, my little
man; for he is a Scotchman, and fears God, and not the priest; and, as
you talk with him, you will be surprised more and more at his knowledge,
his sense, his humour, his courtesy; and you will find out—unless you

"Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

spending money. He never went to the Rising Sun; there was a coffee-shop
near, where he now and then went, or he bought of an old man, who came

spirits and beer made a man colder afterward, and that dry clothes, good
food, cheerfulness, and a comfortable wife at home, were the best things

"Our eyes are to be cast far away from
human reason, far away from Moses upon Christ, and we are to believe
that Christ is given us, in order that for His sake we may be
accounted righteous. In the flesh we never satisfy the Law. Thus,
therefore, we are accounted righteous, not on account of the Law but
on account of Christ because His merits are granted us, if we believe
on Him. If any one, therefore, has considered these foundations,
that we are not justified by the Law because human nature cannot
observe the Law of God and cannot love God, but that we are justified
from the promise, in which, for Christ's sake, reconciliation,
righteousness, and eternal life have been promised, he will easily
understand that justification must necessarily be ascribed to faith,
if he only will reflect upon the fact that it is not in vain that
Christ has been promised and set forth, that He has been born and has
suffered and been raised again; if he will reflect upon the fact that
the promise of grace in Christ is not in vain, that it was made
immediately from the beginning of the world apart from and beyond the
Law; if he will reflect upon the fact that the promise should be
received by faith, as John says, 1 Ep. 5, 10 sq.",6744,1400s

"For nature, having herself formed
the union between our body and soul, knows best in what manner it
may be most easily dissolved, and grants us a longer day to do it,
than we could expect from sickness, which is violent. This is the
death, which, without speaking like a poet, I may call, not death,
but life. Nor can it be otherwise. Such a death does not overtake
one till after a very long course of years, and in consequence of
an extreme weakness; it being only by slow degrees, that men grow
too feeble to walk, and unable to reason, becoming blind, and
deaf, decrepid, and full of every other kind of infirmity. Now I
(by God's blessing) may be quite sure that I am at a very great
distance from such a period.",30660,1400s

Adhar; for Adhar has vowed himself to a life of penance and celibacy in
the temple of Indore, by order of an offended prince;--may he find peace! The writings of divorce are drawn up, and my daughter being already past
the age when a prudent father hastens to marry his child, in order that
the souls of the dead may be duly honoured by their posterity, I have

things, in every good work fruitful, and increasing in the knowledge of
God; (11)strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
unto all patience and long-suffering with joy; (12)giving thanks to
God, even the Father, who hath made us meet for a portion in the
inheritance of the saints in light; (13)who hath plucked us out from
the dominion of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of the
Son of his love: (14)in whom we have redemption through his blood, and
forgiveness of sins. (15)Who is the image of the invisible God, the
prime author of all creation: (16)for by him were all things created,
celestial and terrestrial, visible or invisible, whether thrones, or
dominations, or principalities, or powers, all were created by him, and
for him: (17)and he is before all, and by him all things subsist. (18)And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning,
the first begotten from the dead, that he might be in all things
pre-eminent. (19)For it hath pleased the Father that in him all fulness
should dwell; (20)and by him to reconcile all things to himself, making
peace by the blood of his cross: by him, I say, whether they be things
on earth, or things in the heavens. (21)And you who in time past were
all aliens, and enemies in mind by wicked works, hath he now
reconciled, (22)by the body of his flesh, through death, to present you
holy, and blameless, and irreprehensible in his presence: (23)if ye
abide in faith grounded and firm, and never moved aside from the hope

"Undoubtedly, these
observations have provoked questions which, for lack of sufficient
information, have gone unanswered in the mind of the observer. In the
hopes of remedying this situation—a very grievous situation in the eyes
of a geologist—this brief geologic pamphlet has been written to help the
visitor to the State Forest obtain a greater appreciation of the
handiwork of nature. To begin with, _geology_ can be defined as the study of the history of
the earth as recorded in the rocks. It includes the study of minerals,
rocks, fossils, the structure of the rocks, and the forms of the land. Although only a few have been fortunate enough to choose this subject as
a profession, the field is wide open for amateurs.",62053,1900s

"In his confidential letters to gentlemen of the most
influence in the several states, he represented in strong terms the
dangers which yet threatened the country, and earnestly exhorted them
to a continuance of those sacrifices and exertions which he still
deemed essential to the happy termination of the war. The dissensions
in congress; the removal of individuals of the highest influence and
character from the councils of the nation to offices in the respective
states; the depreciation of the currency; the destructive spirit of
speculation which the imaginary gain produced by this depreciation had
diffused throughout the Union; a general laxity of principles; and an
unwillingness to encounter personal inconvenience for the attainment
of the great object, in pursuit of which so much blood and treasure
had been expended; were the rocks on which, he apprehended, the state
vessel might yet split, and to which he endeavoured, incessantly, to
point the attention of those whose weight of political character
enable them to guide the helm. [Sidenote: Letters from General Washington on the state of public
affairs.] ""I am particularly desirous of a free communication of sentiments with
you at this time,"" says the General in a letter written to a gentleman
of splendid political talents, ""because I view things very
differently, I fear, from what people in general do, who seem to think
the contest at an end, and that to make money, and get places, are the
only things now remaining to be done. I have seen without despondency,
even for a moment, the hours which America has styled her gloomy ones;
but I have beheld no day since the commencement of hostilities, when I
have thought her liberties in such imminent danger as at present.",18593,1700s

"Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return. Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After
discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,
with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained
that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;
for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would
be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early
day for making him the happiest of men.",1342,1700s
"Atten. This was a bad Beginning indeed, and did demonstrate that he
was, as you say, polluted, very much polluted with Original Corruption. For to speak my mind freely, I do confess, that it is mine opinion,
that Children come polluted with sin into the World, and that oft-times
the sins of their youth, especially while they are very young, are
rather by vertue of Indwelling sin, than by examples that are set
before them by others. Not but that they learn to sin by example too,
but Example is not the root, but rather the Temptation unto wickedness. The root is sin within; for from within, out of the heart of man
proceedeth sin.",1986,1600s
"But the Law always accuses us, always shows that God is
angry. [Therefore, what the scholastics say of the love of God is a
dream.] God therefore is not loved until we apprehend mercy by faith. Not until then does He become a lovable object. Although, therefore, civil works, i.e., the outward works of the Law,
can be done, in a measure, without Christ and without the Holy Ghost
[from our inborn light], nevertheless it appears from what we have
said that those things which belong peculiarly to the divine Law, i.e.,
the affections of the heart towards God, which are commanded in the
first table, cannot be rendered without the Holy Ghost.",6744,1400s

method, _Surely the Isles shall wait for me; the ships of Tarshish
first, to bring my sons from far, their silver, and their gold with
them, unto the name of the Lord, thy God._ Isai. lx. 9. This seems to
imply that in the time of the glorious increase of the church, in the
latter days, (of which the whole chapter is undoubtedly a prophecy,)
commerce shall subserve the spread of the gospel. The ships of
Tarshish were trading vessels, which made voyages for traffic to
various parts; thus much therefore must be meant by it, that
_navigation_, especially that which is _commercial_, shall be one
great mean of carrying on the work of God;  and perhaps it may imply
that there shall be a very considerable appropriation of wealth to
that purpose.",11449,1700s
"This has been the case of others, who, as we read in many
authors, have lived a sober life, and, of course, were born with
this perfect constitution; and had it been my lot to enjoy such
a constitution, I should make no doubt of attaining the same age. But, as I was born with feeble stamina, I am afraid I shall not
outlive an hundred. Were others, too, who are also born with an
infirm constitution, to betake themselves to a regular life, as I
have done, they would attain the age of one hundred and upwards,
as will be my case. And this certainty of being able to live a great age is, in my
opinion, a great advantage, and highly to be valued; none being
sure to live even a single hour, except such as adhere to the
rules of temperance. This security of life is built on good and
true natural reasons, which can never fail; it being impossible in
the nature of things, that he, who leads a sober and regular life,
should breed any sickness, or die of an unnatural death, before
the time, at which it is absolutely impossible he should live.",30660,1400s

"The enemy followed our movement with a heavy column of
infantry; but, when they came near enough to exchange shots, they did
not seem to like our looks, as we occupied a low ridge of broken
rocks, against which even a rat could scarcely have hoped to advance
alive; and they again fell back, and opening a tremendous fire of
artillery, which was returned by a battery of our guns. In the course
of a short time, seeing no further demonstration against this part of
the position, our division was withdrawn, and placed in reserve in
rear of the centre. The battle continued to rage with fury in and about the village,
whilst we were lying by our arms under a burning hot sun, some stray
cannon-shot passing over and about us, whose progress we watched for
want of other employment. One of them bounded along in the direction
of an _amateur_, whom we had for some time been observing securely
placed, as he imagined, behind a piece of rock, which stood about five
feet above the ground, and over which nothing but his head was shown,
sheltered from the sun by an umbrella. The shot in question touched
the ground three or four times between us and him; he saw it
coming--lowered his umbrella, and withdrew his head.",28981,1700s

"When the discomfiture was known at Florence, the government was filled
with indignation; and, to impart fresh vigor to the enterprise, and
restore the reputation of their forces, they immediately appointed
Antonio Pucci and Bernardo del Neri commissaries, who, with vast sums of
money, proceeded to the army, and intimated the heavy displeasure of the
Signory, and of the whole city, if they did not return to the walls; and
what a disgrace, if so large an army and so many generals, having only
a small garrison to contend with, could not conquer so poor and weak
a place. They explained the immediate and future advantages that would
result from the acquisition, and spoke so forcibly upon the subject,
that all became anxious to renew the attack. They resolved, in the first
place, to recover the rampart upon the hill; and here it was evident how
greatly humanity, affability, and condescension influence the minds of
soldiers; for Antonio Pucci, by encouraging one and promising another,
shaking hands with this man and embracing that, induced them to proceed
to the charge with such impetuosity, that they gained possession of
the rampart in an instant. However, the victory was not unattended by
misfortune, for Count Antonio da Marciano was killed by a cannon shot. This success filled the townspeople with so much terror, that they began
to make proposals for capitulation; and to invest the surrender with
imposing solemnity, Lorenzo de' Medici came to the camp, when, after a
few days, the fortress was given up.",2464,1400s
"Take him, for
better for worse, you must; and I must love him as I have done from his
childhood, a little while longer--to the end of my life.”

“A little longer, to the end of her life!” said Beauclerc to himself,
as leaning on the back of Helen’s chair he looked at Lady Davenant. “I
cannot believe that she whom I see before me is passing away, to be
with us but a little longer; so full of life as she appears; such energy
divine! No, no, she will live, live long!”

And as his eyes looked that hope, Helen caught it, and yet she doubted,
and sighed, but still she had hope. Cecilia had none; she was sitting
behind her mother; she looked up at Helen, and shook her head; she had
seen more of her mother’s danger, she had been with her in nights of
fearful struggle. She had been with her just after she had written to

Helen’s difficulties, subjects so agitating that the writing of them had

"Although there
are a number of locations known by both Indians and local whites as old
burying grounds, all my informants agreed that in the “real old days”
there was no special cemetery and that these burial spots have developed
since the coming of the white man. This may well have been as a result of
direct white interference with native funeral customs and an insistence
that Indians concentrate their burials. Some of these sites have become
traditional among the Washo. The dispute between the widow and the sister mentioned earlier was an
argument as to whether the deceased would be buried in one of these sites
or in the cemetery at Stewart, Nevada. A white man who has lived in the area for ninety years, reported that as a
boy he often came across caches of belongings of dead Indians in the
mountains.",31429,1900s

"It is natural to think that
at first, men, for ease of memory and help of computation, made use of
counters, or in writing of single strokes, points, or the like, each
whereof was made to signify an unit, i.e., some one thing of whatever
kind they had occasion to reckon. Afterwards they found out the more
compendious ways of making one character stand in place of several
strokes or points. And, lastly, the notation of the Arabians or Indians
came into use, wherein, by the repetition of a few characters or figures,
and varying the signification of each figure according to the place it
obtains, all numbers may be most aptly expressed; which seems to have
been done in imitation of language, so that an exact analogy is observed
betwixt the notation by figures and names, the nine simple figures
answering the nine first numeral names and places in the former,
corresponding to denominations in the latter. And agreeably to those
conditions of the simple and local value of figures, were contrived
methods of finding, from the given figures or marks of the parts, what
figures and how placed are proper to denote the whole, or vice versa. And
having found the sought figures, the same rule or analogy being observed
throughout, it is easy to read them into words; and so the number becomes
perfectly known.",4723,1600s

leave of him at Marly. She came there from Paris on Tuesday, the 6th of
August, so as to arrive as he left dinner, that is, about ten o'clock. She was immediately admitted into the cabinet of the King, with whom she

"To this the insolence of Giorgio Scali
and Tommaso Strozzi (who by their popular influence overawed the
magistrates) also contributed, for the rulers were apprehensive that by
the power these men possessed with the plebeians they could set them at
defiance; and hence it is evident that not only to good men, but even to
the seditious, this government appeared tyrannical and violent. To put a
period to the outrageous conduct of Giorgio, it happened that a servant
of his accused Giovanni di Cambio of practices against the state, but
the Capitano declared him innocent. Upon this, the judge determined to
punish the accuser with the same penalties that the accused would have
incurred had he been guilty, but Giorgio Scali, unable to save him
either by his authority or entreaties, obtained the assistance of
Tommaso Strozzi, and with a multitude of armed men, set the informer
at liberty and plundered the palace of the Capitano, who was obliged
to save himself by flight. This act excited such great and universal
animosity against him, that his enemies began to hope they would be able
to effect his ruin, and also to rescue the city from the power of
the plebeians, who for three years had held her under their arrogant
control. To the realization of this design the Capitano greatly contributed, for
the tumult having subsided, he presented himself before the signors,
and said ""He had cheerfully undertaken the office to which they had
appointed him, for he thought he should serve upright men who would take
arms for the defense of justice, and not impede its progress.",2464,1400s

seems--doesn’t it?--the part that is fullest of an esoteric
fascination?”

argumentatively. “Well, didn’t you notice how intensely interested Osric Dane became
as soon as she heard what the brilliant foreigner--he WAS a foreigner,
wasn’t he?--had told Mrs. Roby about the origin--the origin of the
rite--or whatever you call it?”

Mrs. Plinth looked disapproving, and Mrs. Ballinger visibly wavered. Then she said in a decisive tone: “It may not be desirable to touch on
the--on that part of the subject in general conversation; but, from the
importance it evidently has to a woman of Osric Dane’s distinction,
I feel as if we ought not to be afraid to discuss it among
ourselves--without gloves--though with closed doors, if necessary.”

support; “on condition, that is, that all grossness of language is
avoided.”

lye at the Bottom of it, and partly on the Shore of the _Propontis_,
extending itself as far as the Gardens call’d _Blanchæ_; I am
convinced, among other Authorities, principally by the Author _of the

_Ward_, which as it is not terminated on the Side of the _Taurus_,

on the Top of the third Hill, but not the Descents below it, and
that the ninth _Ward_ lies partly under the eighth, on that Side of
it, which extends from the _Taurus_ Southward towards the Sea of the
_Propontis_, and was partly situate also on the two Declivities; one of
which descends from the _Taurus_ to South, South-west, the other from

court, in consequence of reports injurious to her reputation, which had
begun to be publicly circulated. Her removal indeed was so abrupt that she

the river foamed, and boiled, and whirled among the masses of rock that
had fallen into its channel. As they crept cautiously on, leading their
solitary pack-horse along these giddy heights, they all at once came to
where the river thundered down a succession of precipices, throwing up
clouds of spray, and making a prodigious din and uproar. The travellers
remained, for a time, gazing with mingled awe and delight, at this
furious cataract, to which Mr. Stuart gave, from the color of the
impending rocks, the name of “The Fiery Narrows.”

Letter Tenth To Anne Boleyn


The uneasiness my doubts about your health gave me, disturbed and alarmed
me exceedingly, and I should not have had any quiet without hearing
certain tidings. But now, since you have as yet felt nothing, I hope, and
am assured that it will spare you, as I hope it is doing with us. For when
we were at Walton, two ushers, two valets de chambres and your brother,
master-treasurer, fell ill, but are now quite well; and since we have
returned to our house at Hunsdon, we have been perfectly well, and have
not, at present, one sick person, God be praised; and I think, if you
would retire from Surrey, as we did, you would escape all danger. There is
another thing that may comfort you, which is, that, in truth in this
distemper few or no women have been taken ill, and what is more, no person
of our court, and few elsewhere, have died of it.",32155,1400s

"The Cossack infantry is represented on the other
side of this wagon. On another wagon is a very jolly picture of Stenka
Razin in his boat with little old-fashioned brass cannon, rowing up the
river. Underneath is written the words: ""I attack only the rich, with
the poor I divide everything."" On one side are the poor folk running
from their huts to join him, on the other the rich folk firing at him
from their castle. One wagon is treated purely decoratively, with a
broad effective characteristically South Russian design, framing a
huge inscription to the effect that the Cossacks need not fear that
the Soviet Republic will interfere with their religion, since under its
regime every man is to be free to believe exactly what he likes.",1326,1800s
"Once or twice the friends at whose houses we slept
were able to assist us. But generally they either had no horses, or
none of the commanding power demanded. Often, again, it happened, as
our route was very circuitous, that no inns lay in our neighborhood;
or, if there _were_ inns, the horses proved to be of too slight a
build. At Ballinasloe, and again at Athlone, half the town came out to
help us; and, having no suitable horses, thirty or forty men, with
shouts of laughter, pulled at ropes fastened to our pole and splinter-
bar, and compelled the snorting demons into a flying gallop. But,
naturally, a couple of miles saw this resource exhausted.",6171,1700s
"That is the steam bath kind of weather.”

Houston gets more steam bath weather than any other kind. In 1952, when
the Prudential Insurance Company transferred scores of employees from
New Jersey to its new Southwestern Home Office in Houston, it prepared
an immigrant’s guide. The question “How’s the Climate?” was answered:
“To be perfectly frank about Houston’s weather, even a Texan wouldn’t
brag about it in the summertime. It’s hot and it’s sticky.”

    [Illustration: _On February 14, 1895, Houston received what may have
    been the heaviest snow in its history—twenty-two inches. The old
    Burns house, shown on the day of the snowfall, occupied the site of
    the twenty-one story Texas National Bank Building._]

After the St. Louis Cardinals played their first games in Houston in
1962, Stan Musial said the city has only three seasons—“Summer, and then
July and August.” Members of the British diplomatic service are paid an

Burma, Indonesia, Panama, the Persian Gulf—and Houston.",59068,1900s
"If it were only
a big enough cloud I might try to run away in the darkness. But I am
tired.”

That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined
ditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how
dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run
any risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and
few in the jungle care for those odds. “I will go to the west wall,” Kaa whispered, “and come down swiftly with
the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon
my back in their hundreds, but--”

“I know it,” said Bagheera.",236,1800s
"""That was bad,"" replied Malachi. ""Look at me, my son; say, did you ever

Indian's arm as he spoke. This was the signal agreed upon between Malachi and the party concealed,
who rushed forward and seized the Indian. The Young Otter sprang up in
spite of their endeavors to keep him, and would certainly have escaped,
for he had got his tomahawk clear, and was about to wield it around his
head, had not Martin already passed one of the deer thongs round his
ankle, by which the Indian was thrown again to the ground.",22496,1700s

"But he did not conceal
from me that, although there might be many cases in which the
forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this
case to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not
related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;
he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his
apprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I
finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my
heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to

draughts from an immense jug of whitish wine which stood between his

   Dissabacca _Sea in_ Tartaria; _the Description of those seas, and his
   usage._


This Noble Gentlewoman took sometime occasion to shew him to some Friends,
or rather to speak with him, because she could speak Italian, would feign
her self sick when she should go to the _Bannians,_ or weep over the
Graves, to know how _Bogal_ took him Prisoner; and if he were as the
_Bashaw_ writ to her, a _Bohemian_ Lord conquered by his Hand, as he had
many others, which ere long he would present her, whose Ransomes should
adorn her with the glory of his Conquests. But when she heard him protest he knew no such matter, nor ever saw
_Bogal,_ till he bought him at _Axopolis,_ and that he was an
_English-man,_ only by his Adventures made a Captain in those Countries. To try the truth, she found means to find out many who could speak
_English, French, Dutch,_ and _Italian,_ to whom relating most part of
these former Passages she thought necessary, which they so honestly
reported to her, she took (as it seemed) much compassion on him; but having
no use for him, lest her Mother should sell him, she sent him to her
Brother, the _Timor Bashaw_ of _Nalbrits,_ In the Country of _Cambia,_ a
Province in _Tartaria._

{MN-1} Here now let us remember his passing, in this speculative course
from _Constantinople_ by _Sander, Screw, Panassa, Musa, Lastilla,_ to
_Varna,_ an ancient City upon the _Black Sea._ In all which Journey,
having little more liberty, than his eyes judgment, since his Captivity,
he might see the Towns with their short Towers, and a most plain, fertile,
and delicate Country, especially that most admired place of _Greece,_ now
called _Romania,_ but from _Varna,_ nothing but the _Black Sea_ Water,
till he came to the two Capes of _Taur_ and _Pergilos,_ where he passed
the Streight of _Niger,_ which (as he conjectured) is some ten Leagues
long, and three broad, betwixt two Low-lands, the Channel is deep, {MN-2}
but at the entrance of the Sea _Dissabacca,_ there are many great
Osie-shaulds, and many great black Rocks, which the _Turks_ said were
Trees, Weeds, and Mud, thrown from the In-land Countries, by the
Inundations and violence of the Current, and cast there by the Eddy.",55199,1500s

"Yet they imagine that
satisfactions are of profit in redeeming from the punishments,
whether of purgatory or other punishments. For thus they teach that
in the remission of sins, God [without means, alone] remits the guilt,
and yet, because it belongs to divine justice to punish sin, that He
commutes eternal into temporal punishment. They add further that a
part of this temporal punishment is remitted by the power of the keys,
but that the rest is redeemed by means of satisfactions. Neither
can it be understood of what punishments a part is remitted by the
power of the keys, unless they say that a part of the punishments of
purgatory is remitted, from which it would follow that satisfactions
are only punishments redeeming from purgatory. And these
satisfactions, they say, avail even though they are rendered by those
who have relapsed into mortal sin, as though indeed the divine
displeasure could be appeased by those who are in mortal sin.",6744,1400s
"His own
boat was there anchored by a stone, and he stepped into it, keeping his
hand on the gunwale of Nina's canoe. In a moment the two little
nutshells with their occupants floated quietly side by side, reflected by
the black water in the dim light struggling through a high canopy of
dense foliage; while above, away up in the broad day, flamed immense red
blossoms sending down on their heads a shower of great dew-sparkling
petals that descended rotating slowly in a continuous and perfumed
stream; and over them, under them, in the sleeping water; all around them
in a ring of luxuriant vegetation bathed in the warm air charged with
strong and harsh perfumes, the intense work of tropical nature went on:
plants shooting upward, entwined, interlaced in inextricable confusion,
climbing madly and brutally over each other in the terrible silence of a
desperate struggle towards the life-giving sunshine above--as if struck
with sudden horror at the seething mass of corruption below, at the death
and decay from which they sprang. ""We must part now,"" said Dain, after a long silence. ""You must return at
once, Nina. I will wait till the brig drifts down here, and shall get on

    His martyr'd glory round the accursed cross,

    Its hallow'd numbers, in the realms of bliss

    By his delightful genius saved from death. Oft when the soul is lost in thoughtless guilt,
    And seeming deaf unto the still small voice
    Of conscience and of God, some simple phrase
    Of beauty or sublimity will break

mutton;” and when they said, “An’t it solitary, Old Cheeseman?” he said,
“It is a little dull sometimes:” and then they said, “Well good-bye, Old
Cheeseman!” and climbed down again. Of course it was imposing on Old
Cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole Vacation,

mutton, they gave him rice pudding, pretending it was a treat. And saved
the butcher. So Old Cheeseman went on.",1467,1800s

on every believer these remissions and participations?"" 89. ""Since the pope, by his pardons, seeks the salvation of souls

effect. His name will be carried pretty far, and it will make our system

raised, and distilled over in the ventilating Way, than without it;
having procured 18 Gallons of Sea-water by the _Margate_ Hoy, which
was taken up at some Distance from the Shore, I put three Gallons of
this Sea-water, as soon as I had received it, into the Still; and when
it began to distill, Air was blown up thro’ it. For some Time, as is
usual, in the Distillation of Sea-water; no Spirit of Salt arose; but
after distilling some Time longer, there were very weak whitish Clouds,

Vexations and Persecutions, and forced to bear the _Spanish_ Tyranny

And I was trim'd in Madam Iulias gowne,
Which serued me as fit, by all mens iudgements,
As if the garment had bin made for me:
Therefore I know she is about my height,
And at that time I made her weepe a good,
For I did play a lamentable part.",1108,1500s

The writer of this letter would not cease, till she had caused me likewise
to set my hand, desiring you, though it be short, to take it in good part. I ensure you that there is neither of us but greatly desireth to see you,
and are joyous to hear that you have escaped this plague so well, trusting
the fury thereof to be passed, especially with them that keepeth good

_A farther Discourse of_ New Spain: _And some Account of_ Panuco
_and_ Xalisco. After the perpetration of all the Cruelties rehearsed in _New Spain_
and other places, there came another Rabid and Cruel Tyrant to
_Panuco_, who acted the part of a bloody Tragedian as well as the rest,
and sent away many Ships loaden with these _Barbarians_ to be sold for
Slaves, made this Province almost a Wilderness, and which was
deplorable, Eight Hundred _Indians_, that had Rational Souls were given
in Exchange for a  Burthen-bearing-Beast, a Mule, or Camel. Well, He
was made Governour of the City of _Mexico_, and all _New Spain_, and
with him many other Tyrants had the Office of Auditors confer'd upon
them:  Now they had already made such a progress toward the Desolation
of this Region, that if the _Franciscans_ had not vigorously opposed
them, and that by (the King's Council, the best and greatest Encourager
of Vertue) it had not speedily bin prevented, that which hapned to
_Hispaniola_ in Two Years, had bin the Fate of _Hispania nova_, namely
to be unpeopled, deferred, and intomb'd in its own Rules. A Companion
of this Governour employed Eight Thousand _Indians_ in Erecting a wall
to inclose his Garden, but they all dyed, having no Supplies, nor Wages
from him, to support themselves, at whose Death he was not in the least
concern'd. After the first Captain before spoken of had absolutely profliaged and
ruin'd the _Panuconians_, Fifteen Thousand whereof perished by carrying
their Bag and Baggage: At length he arriv'd at the Province of
_Machuacan_, which is Forty Miles Journey from _Mexico_, and as Fertile
and Populous: The King to honour him in the Rencounter, with a Multiple
of People, marcheth toward him, from whom he had received One Thousand
Services and Civilities very considerable, who gratefully requited him
with Captivity, because Fame had nois'd it abroad, that he was a most
Opulent Prince in Gold and Silver; and to the end he might export from,
and purge him of his Gold, he was cruciated with Torments after this
manner; his Body was extended, Hands bound to a Post, and his Feet put
into a pair of Stocks, they all the while applying burning Coals to his
Feet at a tormenting distance, where a Boy attended, who by little and
little sprinkled them with Oyl, that his Flesh might roast the better:
Before him there stood a Wicked Fellow, presenting a Bow to his Breast
charged with a Mortal Arrow, (if let fly) behind him, another with Dogs
held in with Chains, which he threatned to let loose at him, which if
done, he had bin torn to pieces in a moment; and with these kind of
Torments they racked him to extort a Confession, where his Treasures
lay; till a _Franciscan_ Monk came and deliver'd him from his Torments,
but not from Death, for he departed this miserable Life not long after:
And this was the severe Fate of many _Cacics_ and _Indian_ Lords, who
dyed with the same Torments which they were expos'd to by the
_Spaniards_, in order to the engrossing of their Gold and Sliver to
themselves.",20321,1400s

"They first, however, employed an Ottawa messenger to
bear their defiance to their enemies, and to assure them of their
eternal hatred. It was not long after that a large war-party of the Andirondacks,
composed of the flower of that nation, and headed by Piskaret,
ascended the Mississippi, to make an incursion into the territories of
a nation who dwelt upon its borders above the Falls. It is the custom
of the tribes, when travelling upon the river, to approach to the
verge of the cataract, and then transport their canoes around it. The
Andirondacks were within a bowshot of the cataract, when all at once
the surface of the water became covered with grisly heads, which
grinned hatred and defiance upon the Andirondacks, who, though filled
with courage to dare encounter with men of their own form and nature,
shook with a new sense of fear, as they beheld the hideous
countenances and uplifted arms of the spirits of the flood. In the
centre of the array of water spirits, they beheld the face of the
beautiful Menana, still shining in all its former beauty, her eyes lit
up by the fires of an unquenched and unquenchable love.",20828,1700s

"He look’d, & saw the face of things quite chang’d;
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
All now was turn’d to jollitie and game,
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
And of thir doings great dislike declar’d,
And testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
In prison under Judgements imminent:
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas’d
Contending, and remov’d his Tents farr off;
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
Measur’d by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
Contriv’d, and of provisions laid in large
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons
With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
From under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
Sent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain
Impetuous, and continu’d till the Earth
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting o’re the Waves, all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
Deep under water rould; Sea cover’d Sea,
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
Where luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d
And stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t. How didst thou grieve then, _Adam_, to behold
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
Depopulation; thee another Floud,
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
By th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;

THE _MAHABHARATA_: KRISHNA THE HERO

The first reference to Krishna occurs in the _Chandogya Upanishad_ of
perhaps the sixth century B.C. _Upanishads_ were 'forest sittings' or
'sessions with teachers.' Sages and their disciples discussed the nature
of life and strove to determine the soul's exact relationship to God. The
starting-point was the theory of re-incarnation. Death, it was believed,
did not end the soul.",11924,1900s

    me into this apparel. CLOWN. Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia; if you had but
    look'd big and spit at him, he'd have run. AUTOLYCUS. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter; I am false
    of heart that way, and that he knew, I warrant him.",1800,1500s
"“I’ll get my hat and coat on and get some of the boys to go with me,” he
thought, as he opened the kitchen door and went in. Coach Jordan and his helpers were nearly finished. Barry left the can
and went into the living room, picking up his coat and hat. Kent and the
twins were not around at the time, and so Barry slipped out of the front
door alone. His chums were in the bedroom attending to the fire there.",47613,1900s
"The eyes of all Europe
were turned towards him, for his malady was not without danger;
nevertheless in his bed he affected to attend to affairs as usual; and he
arranged there with Madame de Maintenon, who scarcely ever quitted his
side, the household of the Savoy Princess. The persons selected for the
offices in that household were either entirely devoted to Madame de
Maintenon, or possessed of so little wit that she had nothing to fear
from them. A selection which excited much envy and great surprise was
that of the Duchesse de Lude to be lady of honour. The day before she
was appointed, Monsieur had mentioned her name in sport to the King. ""Yes,"" said the King, ""she would be the best woman in the world to teach
the Princess to put rouge and patches on her cheek;"" and then, being
more devout than usual, he said other things as bitter and marking strong
aversion on his part to the Duchess.",3861,1600s

"She has nothing left but the
remembrance of her fortune, of her beauty, her faults, and her
extravagant living. After the son had wept a long time with his mother, he at length said to
her:

""Let us not give ourselves up to despair. This young widow loves me to
excess; she is more generous than rich, I can answer for her; I will go
and bring her to you."" He returns to his mistress, and finds her in company with a very amiable
young officer. ""What, is it you, M. de la Jeannotière,"" said she; ""what brings you
here?",35595,1600s
"So they let him alone to doe as he would; and when he saw his
time, he tooke a rapier and rane him through the body once or twise, and
tooke from him 5. fathume of wampam, and 3. coats of cloath, and wente
their way, leaving him for dead. But he scrabled away, when they were

by which means they were discovered; and by subtilty the Indeans tooke

"But I had a knife too, and all
a disappinted father's rage to boot, so at it we' went
closin' and strikin' with our knives like two fierce
fiends of the forest. It was noble sport sure-LY. At last
the Delaweer fell over the bleedin' body of his warrior
and I top of him. As he fell the knife dropt from his

"There would be no passing the Straits of the _Bosporus_ which
is inhabited on both Shores by a barbarous People, but for the same
Reason. And though a Man was never so secure of a safe Passage, yet he
might mistake his Road at the Mouth of the _Bosporus_, being misguided
by the false Lights, which the _Thracians_, who inhabit the Coasts of
the _Black Sea_, formerly used to hang out, instead of a _Pharos_. ’Tis
therefore not only in the Power of _Constantinople_, to prevent any
Foreigners sailing the _Black Sea_; but in reality no Powers can sail
it, without some Assistance from her. Since therefore _Constantinople_
is the Fortress of all _Europe_, both against the Pyrates of _Pontus_,
and the Savages of _Asia_, was the never so effectually demolish’d,
as to all Appearance, yet would she rise again out of her Ruins to her
former Grandeur and Magnificence. With what Fury did _Severus_ pursue
this City, even to an entire Subversion?",53083,1400s

nobles, would never have pronounced in favour of the Vicomte, unless he
happened to be in a particularly good humour. Altogether, it was a risky
thing. I deeply sympathised with Mademoiselle d’Amurande in her trouble, and
assured her of my good-will and protection, but I begged her to approve
my course of action, though taken independently of the King. She
willingly left her fate in my hands, and I bade her write my sister the
following note:

MADAME:--You know the vows that bind me; they are sacred, having been
plighted at the foot of the altar. Do not persist, I entreat you, do not
persist in claiming the solemn declaration of my vows.",3854,1600s

got. Madam. _Il le fera, Madame._

"It should
teach us that there is something more in surgery than mechanics,
and something more in medicine than physical diagnosis and drugs. Conclusion


The brain-cells have existed for eons and, amid the vicissitudes
of change, they have persisted with perhaps less alteration than has
the crust of the earth. Whether in man or in the lower animals,
they are related to and obey the same general biologic laws,
thus being bound to the entire past and performing their function
in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association. For so long a time have we directed our attention to tumors,
infections, and injuries that we have not sufficiently considered
the vital force itself. We have viewed each anatomic and pathologic
part as an entity and man as an isolated phenomenon in nature.",1233,1800s
"All the most wealthy
monasteries support only an idle crowd, which gluttonizes upon the
public alms of the Church. Christ, however, teaches concerning the
salt that has lost its savor that it should be cast out and be
trodden under foot, Matt. 5, 13. Therefore the monks by such morals
are singing their own fate [requiem, and it will soon be over with
them]. And now another sign is added, because they are in many
places, the instigators of the death of good men.",6744,1400s
"It was an efficient system, operating much like a modern
cigarette lighter with the spark produced by holding a piece of pyrites
against a revolving rough-edged wheel. The wheel lock, however, was an
expensive weapon, costing twice as much as a matchlock and half as much
again as a flint arm. This did not necessarily preclude its purchase
by the Pilgrims since those colonists were not so apt to economize
on something which affected their life expectancy as closely as did
their firearms. There are no records which state positively that there
were wheel locks at Plymouth, and no authentic wheel lock used there
has survived. The term “firelock” which is used occasionally in the
documents very often was used to denote a wheel lock, and in the case
of the 1646 order mentioned above, it almost certainly had that meaning.",65335,1900s
"On the same
principle we ought to act, receiving those that are weak in the faith,
but boldly resisting these hardened teachers of works, of whom we shall
hereafter speak at more length. Christ also, when His disciples were asked for the tribute money, asked
of Peter whether the children of a king were not free from taxes. Peter
agreed to this; yet Jesus commanded him to go to the sea, saying, ""Lest
we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up
the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth thou
shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for Me and
thee"" (Matt. xvii. 27).",1911,1400s
"He sobbed aloud,
     and had strength enough only to kiss the hands of the two friends. We all advanced, ready to throw ourselves upon the guards at the
     announced signal; but I saw with grief M. de Cinq-Mars cast his hat
     from him with an air of disdain. Our movement had been observed,
     and the Catalonian guard was doubled round the scaffold. I could
     see no more; but I heard much weeping around me. After the three
     usual blasts of the trumpet, the recorder of Lyons, on horseback at
     a little distance from the scaffold, read the sentence of death, to
     which neither of the prisoners listened.",3952,1700s

loved no person but himself. It is said that he caused his own death by taking stimulating medicines,
which destroyed a constitution naturally feeble. There had been some

"Yet these
works are not the means of his justification before God; he does them
out of disinterested love to the service of God; looking to no other
end than to do what is well-pleasing to Him whom he desires to obey most
dutifully in all things. On this principle every man may easily instruct himself in what measure,
and with what distinctions, he ought to chasten his own body. He will
fast, watch, and labour, just as much as he sees to suffice for keeping
down the wantonness and concupiscence of the body. But those who pretend
to be justified by works are looking, not to the mortification of their
lusts, but only to the works themselves; thinking that, if they can
accomplish as many works and as great ones as possible, all is well with
them, and they are justified. Sometimes they even injure their brain,
and extinguish nature, or at least make it useless.",1911,1400s

"REFERENCES TO THE PROTEVANGELION. [This Gospel is ascribed to James. The allusions to it in the ancient
Fathers are  frequent, and their expressions indicate that it had
obtained a very general credit in the Christian world. The controversies
founded upon it chiefly  relate to the age of Joseph at the birth of
Christ, and to his being a widower with children, before his marriage
with the Virgin. It seems material to remark, that the legends of the
latter ages affirm the virginity of Joseph, notwithstanding Epiphanius,
Hilary, Chrysostom, Cyril, Euthymius, Thephylaet, Occumenius, and indeed
all the Latin Fathers till Ambrose, and the Greek Fathers afterwards,
maintain the opinions of Joseph's age and family, founded upon their
belief in the authenticity of this book.",6508,1600s

backed by the whole opinion of the village, condemned justly the conduct

his disturbing the Sacred Ashes of King _Charles_ the Second, from his

requisite to prove a negative; indeed, this is ranked by logicians
amongst those things impossible to be, but it is considered of
the highest importance to soundness of argument, to establish the
affirmative by the most conclusive reasoning. Taking this for granted,
we will apply the doctor's own reasoning. He says, ""Nothing is that of
which every thing, can truly be affirmed. So that the idea of nothing,
if I may so speak, is absolutely the negative of all ideas; the idea,
therefore, either of a finite or infinite nothing is a contradiction

the junta. But Madame des Ursins, who thought that the time had not yet
arrived for this step, persuaded him to remain, and endeavoured to
flatter his vanity by an expedient altogether ridiculous. She gave him
the command of a regiment of guards, and he, priest, archbishop, primate

"On the other hand, the demands of the people of Florence being insolent
and unjust, the nobility, became desperate, prepared for their defense
with their utmost energy, and thus bloodshed and the exile of citizens
followed. The laws which were afterward made, did not provide for the
common good, but were framed wholly in favor of the conquerors. This
too, must be observed, that from the acquisition of power, made by the
people of Rome, their minds were very much improved; for all the offices
of state being attainable as well by the people as the nobility,
the peculiar excellencies of the latter exercised a most beneficial
influence upon the former; and as the city increased in virtue she
attained a more exalted greatness. But in Florence, the people being conquerors, the nobility were deprived
of all participation in the government; and in order to regain a portion
of it, it became necessary for them not only to seem like the people,
but to be like them in behavior, mind, and mode of living. Hence arose
those changes in armorial bearings, and in the titles of families, which
the nobility adopted, in order that they might seem to be of the people;
military virtue and generosity of feeling became extinguished in them;
the people not possessing these qualities, they could not appreciate
them, and Florence became by degrees more and more depressed and
humiliated.",2464,1400s

WE lay three days in New Orleans, but the captain did not succeed in
finding another pilot; so he proposed that I should stand a daylight
watch, and leave the night watches to George Ealer. But I was afraid; I
had never stood a watch of any sort by myself, and I believed I should

          Their daughters (whether willingly or not),

patterns or mode of manufacturing, until he was driven to it to keep his
customers. At the time when I invented the one-day brass clock in 1838,
he said much against it, that it was not half so good as a wood clock,
and that he never would take up any thing again that Jerome had adopted;
but he was compelled to, in a year or two, to keep his customers. He
sent his foreman over to Bristol, where I was then carrying on business,

resemblance to Adeline in expression and manner; and in conduct his
reason told him that she was her superior; nor could he for a moment
hesitate to prefer as a wife, Emma Douglas who had never erred, to
Adeline who had. Colonel Mordaunt felt, to borrow the words of a celebrated female
writer,[1] that 'though it is possible to love and esteem a woman who
has expiated the faults of her youth by a sincere repentance; and though
before God and man her errors may be obliterated; still there exists one
being in whose eyes she can never hope to efface them, and that is her
lover or her husband.' He felt that no man of acute sensibility can
be happy with a woman whose recollections are not pure: she must
necessarily be jealous of the opinion which he entertains of her; and he
must be often afraid of speaking, lest he utter a sentiment that may
wound and mortify her. Besides, he was, on just grounds, more desirous
of marrying a woman whom he 'admired, than one whom he forgave;' and
therefore, while he addressed Emma, he no longer regretted Adeline.",37908,1700s

waters of which, met by the sunbeams, looked like draperies of silver
gauze, formed a contrast to the solemn darkness of the groves. In the evening nothing more was necessary for any well-dressed man to
procure admission to the Queen’s card parties than to be named and
presented, by some officer of the Court, to the gentleman usher of the
card-room. This room, which was very, large, and of octagonal shape, rose
to the top of the Italian roof, and terminated in a cupola furnished with
balconies, in which ladies who had not been presented easily obtained
leave to place themselves, and enjoy, the sight of the brilliant
assemblage. Though not of the number of persons belonging to the Court, gentlemen
admitted into this salon might request one of the ladies seated with the
Queen at lansquenet or faro to bet upon her cards with such gold or notes
as they presented to her.",3891,1700s
"THIS Observation, that the_ Plague _usually begins among the =Poor=,
was the Reason, why I did not make any Difference in my Directions for
=removing the Sick=, in regard to their different Fortunes, when I first
gave my Thoughts upon this Subject: which however, to prevent Cavils, I
have at present done; and have shewn what Method ought to be taken, if
by some unusual Chance, the =Plague= should at the beginning enter a
wealthy Family. And, in this Case, I have advised nothing, which I would
not most readily submit to my self: For I should much rather chuse to be
thus removed from my Dwelling, with the Distemper upon me, to save my
Family, than they, by being shut up with me, should be all exposed to
perish. And as this Way of treating diseased Families is the most
compassionate, that can be devised with any regard to the restraining
the Progress of the Distemper; so it is still much preferable to what
was formerly practised amongst us, on other Accounts. For, according to
what I have advised, it is only required, to =remove some few= Families
at the beginning of the Disease: whereas the Method of =shutting up=
Houses was continued through the whole Course of the Sickness. Perhaps
the Plague, under this Management, may not reach half a Score Families:
I have given Instances, where it has thus been stopt in =One=.",32171,1600s
"I will not be very rash, my dear, in protesting to the contrary:
but I think it never can, and, what is still more, never ought to
be!--My temper, I know, is depended upon. But I have heretofore said,*
that I have something in me of my father's family, as well as of my
mother's. And have I any encouragement to follow too implicitly the
example which my mother sets of meekness, and resignedness to the wills
of others? Is she not for ever obliged (as she was pleased to hint to
me) to be of the forbearing side? In my mother's case, your observation
I must own is verified, that those who will bear much, shall have much
to bear.",9296,1600s

"Somebody has asked me to meet him, either on the Budmouth Road
at noon today, or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae’s. He says he came to
see me some time ago, but a trick was played him, so that he did not
see me. I don’t understand it; but between you and me I think Donald is
at the bottom of the mystery, and that it is a relation of his who
wants to pass an opinion on his choice. But I did not like to go till I
had seen you. Shall I go?”

Henchard replied heavily, “Yes; go.”

The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of
by this closing in of Newson on the scene.",143,1800s
"He wished every man
in St. Helena--a turbulent adjunct of the British Empire--to be a
landowner, and I do think, neither desired nor hoped that any man in
that island should be happy until he was one. Yet there were other men
ready to offer simpler remedies, and to prove that if every man in St.
Helena became a landowner it would become a very hell upon earth,
and more unmanageable than it was before. If these gentlemen do not
sacrifice their pet fancies for the sake of a settlement, what will
become of St. Helena? Just now they were discussing Ginx's Baby. One thought that repeal of
the Poor-Laws and a new system of relief would reach his case; another
saw the root of the Baby's sorrow in Trades' Unions; a third propounded
cooperative manufactures; a fourth suggested that a vast source of
income lay untouched in the seas about the kingdom, which swarmed with
porpoises, and showed how certain parts of these animals were available
for food, others for leather, others for a delicious oil that would be
sweeter and more pleasant than butter; a fifth desired a law to repress
the tendency of Scotch peers to evict tenants and convert arable lands
into sheep-walks and deer-forests; a sixth maintained that there were
waste lands in the kingdom of capacity to support hungry millions.",581,1800s
"No sooner said than done. In union queer
   Together yoked were soon winged horse and steer. The griffin pranced with rage, and his remaining might
   Exerted to resume his old-accustomed flight. 'Twas all in vain--his partner stepped with circumspection,
   And Phoebus' haughty steed must follow his direction;
   Until at last, by long resistance spent,
    When strength his limbs no longer was controlling,
   The noble creature, with affliction bent,
    Fell to the ground, and in the dust lay rolling. ""Accursed beast!""",6796,1700s
"They that give
this right to the bishops refer to this testimony John 16, 12. 13:
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into
all truth. They also refer to the example of the Apostles, who commanded
to abstain from blood and from things strangled, Acts 15, 29. They refer
to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord's Day, contrary
to the Decalog, as it seems.",275,1400s
"It is probably
the same Granary, in which was placed the Statue of _Manaim_, who
march’d his Army against the _Scythians_. There was kept here a brazen
Bushel, which was the common Standard, by which Corn was bought, and
sold. _Valens_ commanded that twelve Bushels of Wheat should be sold at
the Price of an _Aureus_, (in _English_ Coin 17_s._ 1_d._ _ob. qua._)
and commanded a Sailor’s Hand to be cut off, who had eluded the Force
of that Law by Tricks, and Evasions, and in Memory of the Fact, order’d
a Brazen Hand to be hung up in the Granary. They had also at _Constantinople_ Store-houses where they reposited
their Gold, and Silver, and Jewels.",53083,1400s

"151
  Love is too young to know what conscience is,
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love? Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove. For thou betraying me, I do betray
  My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side. No want of conscience hold it that I call,
    Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall. 152
  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
  When I break twenty?",1105,1500s
"Tis, without question. CLARE. Two tedious winters have past o’er, since first
These couple lov’d each other, and in passion
Glued first their naked hands with youthful moisture—
Just so long, on my knowledge. DORCAS. And what of this?",4774,1500s
"But it can readily be imagined, that a burning sensation rose in his
breast, like that of the celebrated painter Correggio, when low-born,
untaught, poor and destitute of every advantage, save that of splendid
native endowment, he stood before the work of the immortal Raphael, and
said, ""I too am a painter!"" Boone's purpose was fixed. In a region, such
as Finley described, far in advance of the wearying monotony of a life
of inglorious toil, he would have space to roam unwitnessed, undisturbed
by those of his own race, whose only thought was to cut down trees, at
least for a period of some years. We wish not to be understood to laud
these views, as wise or just. In the order of things, however, it was
necessary, that men like Finley and Boone, and their companions, should
precede in the wilderness, to prepare the way for the multitudes who
would soon follow.",12846,1700s
"Nonvolcanic craters

Some well-exposed, nearly circular areas of intensely deformed
sedimentary rocks, in which a central vent-like feature is surrounded by
a ring-shaped depression, resemble volcanic structures in gross form. As
no clear evidence of volcanic origin could be found in or near these
structures, scientists initially described them as “cryptovolcanic,” a
term now rarely used. Recent studies have shown that not all craters are
of volcanic origin. Impact craters, formed by collisions with the Earth
of large meteorites, asteroids, or comets, share with volcanoes the
imprints of violent origin, as evidenced by severe disruption, and even
local melting, of rock. Fragments of meteorites or chemically detectable
traces of extraterrestrial materials and indications of strong forces
acting from above, rather than from below, distinguish impact from
volcanic features.",46894,1900s
"During
three-and-twenty years of rough actual trial. I find something of a
veritable Hero necessary for that, of itself. His last words are a prayer; broken ejaculations of a heart
struggling-up, in trembling hope, towards its Maker. We cannot say
that his religion made him _worse_; it made him better; good, not bad. Generous things are recorded of him: when he lost his Daughter, the
thing he answers is, in his own dialect, everyway sincere, and yet
equivalent to that of Christians, 'The Lord giveth, and the Lord
taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'",20585,1700s
"DEAR COUSIN,

We have been in daily hope for a long time, I must call it, of hearing
that the happy knot was tied. My Lord has been very much out of order:
and yet nothing would serve him, but he would himself write an answer to
your letter. It was the only opportunity he should ever have, perhaps,
to throw in a little good advice to you, with the hope of its being of
any signification; and he has been several hours in a day, as his gout
would let him, busied in it. It wants now only his last revisal. He
hopes it will have the greater weight with you, as it appear all in his
own hand-writing.",10462,1600s

"Their path had neatly
bisected the line joining the two stars, and they had begun to put both
glowing masses behind them. Unexpectedly, as if they had reached the
end of a great rubber band to which they had been attached, they had
stopped dead in space. The rubber had stretched as much as it was ever
going to stretch. Then, as Jan reversed direction, it seemed as if the band were
contracting once more. They picked up speed, and the differential
screen glowed green and yellow while their position with respect to
the twin stars underwent a change.",73357,1900s
"nor would the landed-man have receiv’d less for his
victual, than now; for that paper-money would have bought him 20 times
the quantity of goods, silver-money will buy. Land has a more certain value than other goods, for it does not
encrease in quantity, all other goods may. the uses of goods may be
discharged, or by custom be taken from them, and given to other goods:
the use of bread may be taken from oats, and wholly given to wheat:
the use of money may be taken from silver, and given to land: the use
of plate, and the other uses of silver as a metal, may be taken from
silver, and given to some other metal, or some mixture that may be more
fitted for these uses. in any of these cases, these goods lose a part
of their value, proportion’d to the uses are taken from them: but land
cannot lose any of its uses. for as every thing is produced by land,
so the land must keep its value, because it can be turn’d to produce
the goods that are in use.",70784,1600s

Mezzerow didn't return to report his discovery in person, he did send in

In such a just and charitable war. KING PHILIP. Well then, to work; our cannon shall be bent
Against the brows of this resisting town. Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
To cull the plots of best advantages. We’ll lay before this town our royal bones,
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen’s blood,
But we will make it subject to this boy.",1511,1500s
"Imbowell'd? If thou imbowell mee to day, Ile
giue you leaue to powder me, and eat me too to morow. 'Twas time to counterfet, or that hotte Termagant Scot,
had paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I am no counterfeit;
to dye, is to be a counterfeit, for hee is but the
counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man: But
to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liueth, is to be
no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeede.",2251,1500s
"These they
raised on their shoulders to men above, who pulled them up as if from
the grave, and carried them to a neighbouring house; they were unable to
walk, and so wasted that they appeared like mere skeletons. They were
immediately put to bed, and gruel of rye-flour and a little butter was
given to recover them. ""Some days after, the magistrate of the place came to visit them, and
found the wife still unable to rise from bed, or use her feet from the
intense cold she had endured, and the uneasy posture she had been in. The sister, whose legs had been bathed with hot wine, could walk with
some difficulty, and the daughter needed no further remedies. ""On the magistrate's interrogating the women, they told him that, on the
morning of the 19th of March, they were in the stable with a boy of six
years old, and a girl of about thirteen.",30274,1700s

"We know, however, that
he retained to the time of his death some portion of the family property,
and left it to his sister, Edith Pope, perhaps then the sole survivor. Of the fourteen daughters, it would seem that some may have died in
infancy or in very early life. The General used to speak of his _ten_
sisters, and to compare them with the five wise and five foolish virgins,
that is, five Roman Catholics, and five of the English Protestant Church;
but which, in his opinion, were the wise, and which the foolish, does not
appear in the family tradition preserved by John Charles Brooke, Somerset
Herald, who was descended of one of them. To place them in the exact order of seniority is out of our power, though
a more thorough search in the Yorkshire parish registers might enable us
to do so. All we can pretend to is to place them in an order approximate to the
truth; and I need not apprise the reader that where we have to deal with
so large a family, there must be a long interval between the elder and the
younger.",36544,1700s

"One day, when at the Nelson’s Head
      (For which he may be blamed of you),
   A holy man appeared, and said,
      “Oh, ROBERT, I’m ashamed of you.”

   He laid his hand on ROBERT’S beer
      Before he could drink up any,
   And on the floor, with sigh and tear,
      He poured the pot of “thruppenny.”

   “Oh, ROBERT, at this very bar
      A truth you’ll be discovering,
   A good and evil genius are
      Around your noddle hovering. “They both are here to bid you shun
      The other one’s society,
   For Total Abstinence is one,
      The other, Inebriety.”

   He waved his hand—a vapour came—
      A wizard POLTER reckoned him;
   A bogy rose and called his name,
      And with his finger beckoned him. The monster’s salient points to sum,—
      His heavy breath was portery:
   His glowing nose suggested rum:
      His eyes were gin-and-_wor_tery. His dress was torn—for dregs of ale
      And slops of gin had rusted it;
   His pimpled face was wan and pale,
      Where filth had not encrusted it. “Come, POLTER,” said the fiend, “begin,
      And keep the bowl a-flowing on—
   A working man needs pints of gin
      To keep his clockwork going on.”

   BOB shuddered: “Ah, you’ve made a miss
      If you take me for one of you:
   You filthy beast, get out of this—
      BOB POLTER don’t wan’t none of you.”

   The demon gave a drunken shriek,
      And crept away in stealthiness,
   And lo!",931,1800s
"Galactically speaking,
twenty thousand years is a mere wink in time. The breeze didn't carry the page very far. It simply whisked it through
a convenient window, deposited it beneath a xixxix tree and then
returned to the hills to rest. But the choice of a xixxix tree is highly
significant and substantiates the malicious nature of the breeze's act. If it had chosen a muu or a buxx tree instead, the Galactic Historian
might have found the page in the morning when he took his constitutional
through the university grounds.",28924,1900s
"Secondly, this tacitly also insinuates, as if we had IDEAS of these
proposed essences. For to what purpose else is it, to inquire whether
this or that thing have the real essence of the species man, if we did
not suppose that there were such a specifick essence known? Which yet
is utterly false. And therefore such application of names as would make
them stand for ideas which we have not, must needs cause great disorder
in discourses and reasonings about them, and be a great inconvenience in
our communication by words. 22.",10616,1600s

“It doesn’t matter,” said the Philosopher. “In its proper place I
admit the necessity for water. As a thing to sail a ship on it can
scarcely be surpassed (not, you will understand, that I entirely
approve of ships, they tend to create and perpetuate international
curiosity and the smaller vermin of different latitudes). As an
element wherewith to put out a fire, or brew tea, or make a slide

"It is evident, for
instance, that Napoleon at the zenith of his glory enjoyed an
immense prestige by the mere fact of his power, but he was
already endowed in part with this prestige when he was without
power and completely unknown. When, an obscure general, he was
sent, thanks to influential protection, to command the army of
Italy, he found himself among rough generals who were of a mind
to give a hostile reception to the young intruder dispatched them
by the Directory. From the very beginning, from the first
interview, without the aid of speeches, gestures, or threats, at
the first sight of the man who was to become great they were
vanquished. Taine furnishes a curious account of this interview
taken from contemporary memoirs. ""The generals of division, amongst others Augereau, a sort of
swashbuckler, uncouth and heroic, proud of his height and his
bravery, arrive at the staff quarters very badly disposed towards
the little upstart dispatched them from Paris.",445,1800s

"A like bold adventure carried
out from the same grounds the following month was attended with graver
peril. A heavy thunderstorm appearing imminent, Garnerin elected to
ascend with great rapidity, with the result that his balloon, under the
diminished pressure, quickly became distended to an alarming degree, and
he was reduced to the necessity of piercing a hole in the silk, while
for safety's sake he endeavoured to extinguish all lamps within reach. He now lost all control over his balloon, which became unmanageable in
the conflict of the storm. Having exhausted his ballast, he presently
was rudely brought to earth and then borne against a mountain side,
finally losing consciousness until the balloon had found anchorage three
hundred miles away from Paris. A night ascent, which reads as yet more sensational and extraordinary,
is reported to have been made a year or two previously, and when it is
considered that the balloon used was of the Montgolfier type the account

“All night, my boy—for _you!_” And Jim fetched him, with a vulgar
little guffaw, a thrust that gave relief to the picture. But he had got

Princess does; Heaven or our mood is the reason why we judge differently
about everything. But, as she blames you, and fancies your jealousy to
be a frightful monster, if I were in your place I should obey her
wishes, and endeavour to conceal from her eyes what offends them. A
lover undoubtedly acts wisely when he tries to suit his temper to ours;
a hundred acts of politeness have less influence than this unison, which
makes two hearts appear as if stirred by the same feelings. This
similarity firmly unites them; for we love nothing so much as what
resembles ourselves. GARC.",6740,1600s

Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two present, and
promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied. She was
particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady
Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to
come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.",105,1700s

cruelly sharp, sudden and overwhelming that it brought him to his knees

"In the year 1758, the Quakers thought it their duty, as a body, to pass
another resolution upon this subject. At this, time the nature of the
trade beginning to be better known, we find them more animated upon it,
as the following extract will show:--

""We fervently warn all in profession with us, that they carefully avoid
being any way concerned in reaping the unrighteous profits, arising from
the iniquitous practice of dealing in negro or other slaves; whereby, in
the original purchase, one man selleth another, as he doth the beasts
that perish, without any better pretension to a property in him than
that of superior force; in direct violation of the Gospel rule, which
teacheth all to do as they would be done by, and to do good to all;
being the reverse of that covetous disposition, which furnisheth
encouragement to those poor ignorant people to perpetuate their savage
wars, in order to supply the demands of this most unnatural traffic, by
which great numbers of mankind, free by nature, are subject to
inextricable bondage, and which hath often been observed to fill their
possessors with haughtiness, tyranny, luxury, and barbarity, corrupting
the minds and debasing the morals of their children, to the unspeakable
prejudice of religion and virtue, and the exclusion of that holy spirit
of universal love, meekness, and charity, which is the unchangeable
nature and the glory of true Christianity. We, therefore, can do no
less, than, with the greatest earnestness, impress it upon Friends
everywhere, that they endeavour to keep their hands clear of this
unrighteous gain of oppression."" The Quakers hitherto, as appears by the two resolutions which have been
quoted, did nothing more than seriously warn all those in religious
profession with them against being concerned in this trade. But in three
years afterwards, or at the yearly meeting in 1761, they came to a
resolution, as we find by the following extract from their minutes, that
any of their members haying a concern in it should be disowned:--""This
meeting having reason to apprehend that divers under our name, are
concerned in the unchristian traffic in negroes, doth recommend it
earnestly to the care of Friends everywhere, to discourage, as much as
in them lies, a practice so repugnant to our Christian profession; and
to deal with all such as shall persevere in a conduct so reproachful to
Christianity; and to disown them, if they desist not therefrom.""",10633,1700s

CHAP. XIV. _Of the Operation of _Castration_._

The Mortification or the _Sarcocele_ of the Testicles, gives occasion to
this Operation; to perform which, the Patient must be laid upon his Back,
with his Buttocks higher than his Head, his Legs being kept open, and the
Skin of the _Scrotum_ taken up, one end of which is to be held by a
Servant, and the other by the Surgeon, who having made a longitudinal
Incision therein, or from the top to the bottom, slips off the Flesh of the
_Dartos_ which covers the Testicle, binds up the Vessels that lie between
the Rings and the Tumour, and cuts 'em off a Fingers breadth beneath the
Ligature: But care must be taken to avoid tying the Spermatick Vessels too
hard, for fear of a Convulsion, and {239} to let one end of the Thread pass
without the Wound. If an Excrescence of Flesh stick to the Testicle, and it
be moveable or loose, it is requisite to take it off neatly, leaving a
small Piece of it on the Testicle; and if any considerable Vessels appear
in the Tumour, they must be bound before they are cut. _The Dressing and Bandage._

The Dressing is made with Pledgets and Bolsters laid upon the _Scrotum_;
and the proper Bandage is the _Suspensor_ of the _Scrotum_, which hath four
Heads or Ends, of which the upper serve as a Cincture or Girdle; and the
lower passing between the Thighs, and fasten'd behind to the Cincture.",34157,1600s
"But afterward they consulted how to persecute those that lay hid in the
Mountains, who were miserably massacred, and consequently this Isle
made desolate, which I saw not long after, and certainly it is a
dreadful and depolorable sight to behold it thus unpeopled and laid
waste, like a Desert. ----------------------------------------------------------------------


_Of the_ CONTINENT. In the Year 1514, a certain unhappy Governour Landed on the firm Land
or Continent, a most bloody Tyrant, destitute of all Mercy and
Prudence, the Instrument of God's Wrath, with a Resolution to people
these parts with _Spaniards_; and although some Tyrants had touched
here before him, and Cruelty hurried them into the other World by
several wayes of Slaughter, yet they came no farther than to the Sea
Coast, where they comitted podigious Thefts and Robberies, but this
Person exceeded all that ever dwelt in other Islands, though execrable
and profligate Villains: for he did not only ravage and depopulate the
Sea-Coast, but buried the largest Regions and most ample Kingdoms in
their own Ruins, sending Thousdands to Hell by his Butcheries. He made
Incursions for many Miles continuance, that is to say, in those
Countries that are included in the Territories of _Darien_ and the
Provinces of _Nicaraqua_, where are near Five Hundred Miles of the most
Fertil Land in the World, and the most opulent for Gold of all the
Regions hitherto discover'd. And although _Spain_ has bin sufficiently
furnished with the purest Gold, yet it was dig'd out of the Bowels and
Mines of the said Countries by the _Indians_, where (as we have said)
they perished.",20321,1400s
"""Not of people destined to suffer so much as _I_ have suffered--as I
still suffer."" The insistence of his self-pity chilled me, and I harked back to a
question he had not straightly answered. ""Tell me: Was it marked in your hands that you were not going to pull
that cord?"" Again he looked at his hands, and then, having pressed them for a
moment to his face, ""It was marked very clearly,"" he answered, ""in
THEIR hands."" Two or three days after this colloquy there had occurred to me in
London an idea--an ingenious and comfortable doubt.",761,1800s
"The goodness of the
soil is evident from this circumstance, that though the ground, after
the nine months of dry weather, looks altogether like barren sands, it
puts on an universal coat of green within seven days after the rains
begin to fall. Farther to confirm this, among the many hundreds of acres
I have seen in corn in India, I never saw any that did not grow up as
thick as it could well stand. Their ground is tilled by ploughs drawn by
oxen; the seed-time being in May or the beginning of June, and the
harvest in November and December, the most temperate months in all the
year. The ground is not inclosed, except near towns and villages, which
stand very thick. They do not mow their grass for hay as we do; but cut
it either green or withered, when wanted.",13055,1700s
"""The people couldn't help themselves,"" he said ambiguously. ""Because they're in the U.F.W. and Eric Young cracks the whip. Is that

"There was no other word for him but “funny.”

He rolled back again and lay staring. “Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” What right has a
little bishop in a purple stock and doeskin breeches, who hangs back in
his palace from the very call of God, to a phrase so fine and tragic as
“the body of this death?”

He was the most unreal thing in the universe. He was a base insect
giving himself airs. What advantage has a bishop over the Praying
Mantis, that cricket which apes the attitude of piety? Does he matter
more--to God?",1269,1800s
"A situation more private, though not wholly so, would be more
proper; such a one as the garden of the Infirmary would afford: it would
there have all the publicity the curious could wish, and all the security
the antiquary could desire. Our visitor, continuing his walk along this street, which, as he probably
will know, is on the great road from the metropolis to the north-west
part of the kingdom, arrives at a scene of busy traffic. Here, among
numbers of newly-erected dwellings (proofs of the increasing population
of the town) is the public and principal wharf on the navigable canal,
near which is an iron foundery. This canal was formed, in consequence of
a bill passed in 1791, for the purpose of opening a communication with
the Loughborough canal, and through that, with the various navigations,
united to the Trent. The line of the canal from Leicester to
Loughborough is near sixteen miles in extent, and serves to supply
Leicester with coal, lime, and the greater part of all the other heavy
articles, which the consumption of a place, containing sixteen thousand
inhabitants, requires.",25895,1700s
"He
wished to give him also a beautiful sword, ornamented with diamonds, but
he excused himself from accepting it. The Czar, on his side, distributed
60,000 livres to the King's domestics, who had waited upon him; gave to
D'Antin, Marechal d'Estrees, and Marechal Tesse, his portrait, adorned
with diamonds, and five gold and eleven silver medals, representing the
principal actions of his life. He made a friendly present to Verton,
whom he begged the Regent to send to him as charge d'affaires of the
King, which the Regent promised. On Wednesday, the 16th of June, he attended on horseback a review of the
two regiments of the guards; gendarmes, light horse, and mousquetaires. There was only M. le Duc d'Orleans with him; the Czar scarcely looked at
these troops, and they perceived it.",3870,1600s

"The extreme uniformity of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature
in the landscape of the greater part of New South Wales. Everywhere we
have an open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a very
thin pasture, with little appearance of verdure. The trees nearly all
belong to one family, and mostly have their leaves placed in a
vertical, instead of as in Europe, in a nearly horizontal position: the
foliage is scanty, and of a peculiar pale green tint, without any
gloss. Hence the woods appear light and shadowless: this, although a
loss of comfort to the traveller under the scorching rays of summer, is
of importance to the farmer, as it allows grass to grow where it
otherwise would not. The leaves are not shed periodically: this
character appears common to the entire southern hemisphere, namely,
South America, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope.",944,1800s
"Article XVII: Of Christ's Return to Judgment. Also they teach that at the Consummation of the World Christ will appear
for judgment and will raise up all the dead; He will give to the godly
and elect eternal life and everlasting joys, but ungodly men and the
devils He will condemn to be tormented without end. They condemn the Anabaptists, who think that there will be an end to the
punishments of condemned men and devils. They condemn also others who are now spreading certain Jewish opinions,
that before the resurrection of the dead the godly shall take possession
of the kingdom of the world, the ungodly being everywhere suppressed. Article XVIII: Of Free Will.",275,1400s
"And although the death of Ladislaus had
removed the cause which induced the pope to call the council, still,
having promised to attend, he could not refuse to go there. In a few
months after his arrival at Constance he discovered his error, but it
was too late; endeavoring to escape, he was taken, put into prison, and
compelled to renounce the papacy. Gregory, one of the anti-popes, sent
his renunciation; Benedict, the other, refusing to do the same, was
condemned as a heretic; but, being abandoned by his cardinals, he
complied, and the council elected Oddo, of the Colonnesi family, pope,
by the title of Martin V. Thus the church was united under one head,
after having been divided by many pontiffs. Filippo Visconti was, as we have said, in the fortress of Pavia. But
Fazino Cane, who in the affairs of Lombardy had become lord of Vercelli,
Alessandria, Novara, and Tortona, and had amassed great riches, finding
his end approach, and having no children, left his wife Beatrice heiress
of his estates, and arranged with his friends that a marriage should be
effected between her and Filippo.",2464,1400s
"Indeed, when we left the harbour we had little
hope of finding a passage; and the principal object in moving was, to
employ the men, in order to prevent their reflecting upon and discussing
the dangers of our situation, which we knew they were too apt to do when
leisure permitted. Our observations place the entrance of Detention
Harbour in latitude 67° 53' 45"", longitude 110° 41' 20"" W., variation

mortification to discover that two of the bags of pemmican, which was
our principal reliance, had become mouldy by wet.",18985,1700s

is no longer its own, but that of Christ; but, on account of its faith

"Nevertheless, in
process of time, they had collected again, and increased to such a
degree, that, in 1612, a new order came out for their extermination. In the year 1572, they were compelled to retire from the territories of
Milan and Parma; and at a period somewhat earlier, they were chased
beyond the Venetian jurisdiction. They were not allowed the privilege of
remaining unmolested in Denmark, as the code of Danish law specifies:
“The Tartars, _Gypsies_, who wander about every where, doing great damage
to the people, by their lies, thefts, and witchcraft, shall be taken into
custody by every magistrate.”

Sweden was not more favourable, having attacked them at three different
times: A very sharp order for their expulsion came out in 1662. The Diet
of 1723 published a second, and that of 1727, repeated the foregoing with
additional severity. They were excluded from the Netherlands under pain of death, partly by
Charles the Vth, and afterwards by the United States, in 1582.",29063,1700s

praying, as it is for a woman when pangs of travel are upon her to
forbear crying. If all the world should tell me that such a man hath

"_Chap. xv._: ON WHAT CONDITION THE HUNTSMAN WAS SET FREE


Meanwhile 'twas known at Soest how it had fared with the convoy, how I
and the corporal had been captured and whither we had been taken; and
therefore next day came a drummer to fetch us back: whereupon the
corporal and the three others were delivered up, together with a letter
to the following purport (for the commandant sent it to me to read):


""Monsieur, etc.,--By the bearer, your tambour, your message hath been
delivered: and in answer thereto I restore herewith, in return for
ransom received, the corporal and the three other prisoners: but as
concerns Simplicissimus, called the Huntsman, the same cannot be
allowed to return, as having once served on this side. But if I can

"27, he says to them, Ye are the body of Christ, and his members
severally. (See the original of these passages in Griesbachs
Greek Testament.) Thus you see, reader, that Paul considered
Christians as members of his (Christs) body, of his flesh, and of
his bones, because they partook of one loaf, which was the body
of Christ. The Papists are in the right, and have been much
slandered by the Protestants, for the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
or at least the Real Presence, is as plainly taught in the New
Testament, as the doctrine of the Atonement. You have seen what
Paul believed upon this subject, and I shall corroborate the sense I
put upon his words, by the words of Jesus, his master, and by
quotations from the earliest Fathers. Jesus says, John vi.--I am the living bread which came down
from Heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever,
and the bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for
the life of the world. The Jews, therefore, contended among
themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

unless ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye
have not life in you.",15968,1700s

Importance and Concern, that we can neither live nor subsist in any
Plenty with Decency, or Conveniency or be said to live indeed at all
without them: whatsoever Food is necessary to sustain us, whatsoever
contributes to delight and refresh us, are supply'd and brought forth
out of that plentiful and abundant store: and ah, how much more
innocent, sweet and healthful, is a Table cover'd with these, than with
all the reeking Flesh of butcher'd and slaughter'd Animals: Certainly
Man by Nature was never made to be a _Carnivorous_ Creature; nor is
he arm'd at all for Prey and Rapin, with gag'd and pointed Teeth and
crooked Claws, sharp'ned to rend and tear: But with gentle Hands to
gather Fruit and Vegetables, and with Teeth to chew and eat them: Nor
do we so much as read the Use of _Flesh_ for Food, was at all permitted
him, till after the Universal Deluge, _&c._

To this might we add that transporting Consideration, becoming both our
Veneration and Admiration of the infinitely wise and glorious Author of
Nature, who has given to _Plants_ such astonishing Properties; such
fiery Heat in some to warm and cherish, such Coolness in others to
temper and refresh, such pinguid Juice to nourish and feed the Body,
such quickening _Acids_ to compel the Appetite, and grateful vehicles to
court the Obedience of the Palate, such Vigour to renew and support our
natural Strength, such ravishing Flavour and Perfumes to recreate and
delight us: In short, such spirituous and active Force to animate and
revive every Faculty and Part, to all the kinds of Human, and, I had
almost said Heavenly Capacity too. What shall we add more? Our Gardens
present us with them all; and whilst the _Shambles_ are cover'd with
Gore and Stench, our _Sallets_ scape the Insults of the Summer _Fly_,
purifies and warms the Blood against Winter Rage: Nor wants there
Variety in more abundance, than any of the former Ages could shew.",15517,1600s
"The law, that was to govern Adam, was the same that was to
govern all his posterity, the law of reason. But his offspring having
another way of entrance into the world, different from him, by a natural
birth, that produced them ignorant and without the use of reason, they
were not presently under that law; for no body can be under a law, which
is not promulgated to him; and this law being promulgated or made known
by reason only, he that is not come to the use of his reason, cannot be
said to be under this law; and Adam’s children, being not presently as
soon as born under this law of reason, were not presently free: for law,
in its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a
free and intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no
farther than is for the general good of those under that law: could they
be happier without it, the law, as an useless thing, would of itself
vanish; and that ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in
only from bogs and precipices. So that, however it may be mistaken, the
end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge
freedom: for in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where
there is no law, there is no freedom: for liberty is, to be free from
restraint and violence from others; which cannot be, where there is no
law: but freedom is not, as we are told, a liberty for every man to do
what he lists: (for who could be free, when every other man’s humour
might domineer over him?) but a liberty to dispose, and order as he
lists, his person, actions, possessions, and his whole property, within
the allowance of those laws under which he is, and therein not to be
subject to the arbitrary will of another, but freely follow his own. Sect.",7370,1600s
"""It is the duty of every person to possess the gospel, and read it?"" ""Yes, it is the duty of every one. 'For,' said Paul, 'if our gospel be

glorious gospel should shine unto them.'"" They then reviled him, and
spurned him away from their sight, and began to meditate measures of
violence against him. He was separated from all around him, and
compelled to take his meals by himself; and lest he should attempt to
escape, a person was set over him to keep him under a constant watch.",22400,1500s

incline toward the people, moved by the reasons which they had
advanced. Thinking to find in others the same instability of purpose, he
endeavored to effect an amicable arrangement. With this design he called
together the fourteen who were yet in office, and in the best terms
he could imagine advised them to give up the Signory to the people, in
order to secure the peace of the city; and assured them that if they
refused, ruin would most probably be the result. This discourse excited the anger of the nobility to the highest pitch,
and Ridolfo de' Bardi reproved him in unmeasured terms as a man of
little faith; reminding him of his friendship for the duke, to prove the
duplicity of his present conduct, and saying, that in driving him away

were committed against God and our Neighbours, and tended to the utter
Ruine and Perdition of this New World. These Laws were published by
his Majesties Order, several Persons of highest Authority, Councellors,
Learned, and Conscientious Men, being assembled together for that
purpose, and many Debates made at _Valedolid_ about this weighty

"The weather was inexpressibly
pleasant, and we were all seated on the deck, when our canvas began to
swell with the wind. We had likewise in our view above thirty other sail
around us, all in the same situation. Here an observation occurred to
me, which, perhaps, though extremely obvious, did not offer itself
to every individual in our little fleet: when I perceived with what
different success we proceeded under the influence of a superior power
which, while we lay almost idle ourselves, pushed us forward on our
intended voyage, and compared this with the slow progress which we had
made in the morning, of ourselves, and without any such assistance,
I could not help reflecting how often the greatest abilities lie
wind-bound as it were in life; or, if they venture out and attempt to
beat the seas, they struggle in vain against wind and tide, and, if they
have not sufficient prudence to put back, are most probably cast away on
the rocks and quicksands which are every day ready to devour them. It was now our fortune to set out melioribus avibus. The wind freshened

"as, on the contrary, the bare
mention of disorder and intemperance is offensive to our ears. Nay, there is the same difference between the mentioning these two
things, as between the uttering of the words angel and devil. Thus I have assigned my reasons for abandoning intemperance, and
betaking myself intirely to a sober life; with the method I
pursued in doing so, and what was the consequence of it; and,
finally, the advantages an blessings, which a sober life confers
upon those who embrace it. Some sensual, inconsiderate persons
affirm, that a long life is no blessing; and that the state of a
man, who has passed his seventy-fifth year, cannot really be called
life, but death: but this is a great mistake, as I shall fully
prove; and it is my sincere wish, that all men would endeavour to
attain my old age, in order that they too may enjoy that period of
life, which of all others is the most desirable. I will therefore give an account of my recreations, and the relish
which I find at this stage of life, in order to convince the public
(which may likewise be done by all those who know me) that the state
I have now attained to is by no means death, but real life; such a
life, as by many is deemed happy, since it abounds with all the
felicity that can be enjoyed in this world.",30660,1400s

"As men who labor in that mine
     Of Cornwall, hollowed out beneath the bed
     Of ocean, when a storm rolls overhead,
     Hear the dull booming of the world of brine
     Above them, and a mighty muffled roar
     Of winds and waters, yet toil calmly on,
     And split the rock, and pile the massive ore,
     Or carve a niche, or shape the archëd roof;
     So I, as calmly, weave my woof
     Of song, chanting the days to come,
     Unsilenced, though the quiet summer air
     Stirs with the bruit of battles, and each dawn
     Wakes from its starry silence to the hum
     Of many gathering armies. Still,
     In that we sometimes hear,
     Upon the Northern winds, the voice of woe
     Not wholly drowned in triumph, though I know

     Dry all our tears,
     I may not sing too gladly. To Thy will

"It is known that common deportment, such as may
pass for elegant and proper off the stage, would no more be thought
sufficient upon it than the dialogue of common polite conversation,
would be accurate or spirited enough for the language of a play. So
that trusting to chance only will not do. The actions of every scene
ought to be as much as possible a compleat composition of well varied
movements, considered as such abstractedly, and apart from what may
be merely relative to the sense of the words. Action consider'd with
regard to assisting the authors meaning, by enforcing the sentiments
or raising the passions, must be left entirely to the judgment of the
performer, we only pretend to shew how the limbs may be made to have an
equal readiness to move in all such directions as may be acquired. What I would have understood by action, abstractedly and apart from
its giving force to the meaning of the words, may be better conceived
by supposing a foreigner, who is a thorough master of all the effects
of action, at one of our theatres, but quite ignorant of the language
of the play; it is evident his sentiments under such limitations,
would chiefly arise from what he might distinguish by the lines of the
movements belonging to each character; the actions of an old man, if
proper, or not, would be visible to him at once, and he would judge of
low and odd characters, by the inelegant lines which we have already
shewn to belong to the characters of punch, harlequin, pierrott, or
the clown; so he would also form his judgment of the graceful acting
of a fine gentleman, or hero, by the elegance of their movements in
such lines of grace and beauty as have been sufficiently described.",51459,1600s
"He produced a work which we now indeed
justly deem imperfect, but which is perhaps the most complete that the
world has yet owed, at so early a stage in the progress of any science,
to the genius and learning of one man. So great is the uncertainty of
posthumous reputation, and so liable is the fame even of the greatest
men to be obscured by those new fashions of thinking and writing which
succeed each other so rapidly among polished nations, that Grotius, who
filled so large a space in the eye of his contemporaries, is now perhaps
known to some of my readers only by name. Yet if we fairly estimate both
his endowments and his virtues, we may justly consider him as one of the
most memorable men who have done honour to modern times. He combined the
discharge of the most important duties of active and public life with
the attainment of that exact and various learning which is generally the
portion only of the recluse student. He was distinguished as an advocate
and a magistrate, and he composed the most valuable works on the law of
his own country; he was almost equally celebrated as an historian, a
scholar, a poet, and a divine; a disinterested statesman, a
philosophical lawyer, a patriot who united moderation with firmness, and
a theologian who was taught candour by his learning.",29372,1700s
"These views prevailed, and it was resolved that the ten
should provide all the means in their power for rescuing Furli from the
hands of the duke. Filippo, finding the Florentines resolved to occupy the places he had
undertaken to defend, postponed all personal considerations, and sent
Agnolo della Pergola with a strong force against Imola, that Ludovico,
having to provide for the defense of his own possessions, might be
unable to protect the interests of his grandson. Agnolo approached Imola
while the forces of the Florentines were at Modigliana, and an intense
frost having rendered the ditches of the city passable, he crossed them
during the night, captured the place, and sent Lodovico a prisoner to
Milan. The Florentines finding Imola in the hands of the enemy, and the
war publicly known, sent their forces to Furli and besieged it on all
sides. That the duke's people might not relieve it, they hired Count
Alberigo, who from Zagonara, his own domain, overran the country daily,
up to the gates of Imola.",2464,1400s

notwithstanding, with a poor weakly constitution; and of these some
live to the age of ten; others to twenty; others to thirty or
forty; yet they do not live to extreme old age. Others, again,
bring into the world a perfect constitution, and live to old age;

sickness and sorrow; for which they are to thank themselves; because
they most unreasonably presume on the goodness of their
constitution;  and cannot by any means be brought to depart, when
brought to depart, when grown old, from the mode of life they

strings, minus double-basses, against an ascending obbligato from the
piano. For reasons best known to himself, Tschaikowsky never allows
this imposing theme to return to the scene. The “blind beggar tune” is the name often applied to the piano theme

Prince of the _Bulgarians_, a Man of a cruel and turbulent Spirit,
march’d an Army against the _Chrobatians_; when he was conquer’d, and
lost his Army, partly by the Badness of the Roads, some Body inform’d
the Emperor that the Statue plac’d above the Arch in the _Xerolophon_,
looking Westward, was carv’d for the Statue of _Simeon_ of _Bulgaria_,
and that if any one cut off the Head of the Statue, _Simeon_ should
immediately die. The Emperor commands the Head of the Statue to be
chopt off, and soon received the News that _Simeon_ was dead of a

"A certain business house which paid six hundred dollars
for letter-postage will pay hereafter only four hundred; it will
add, then, a net profit of two hundred dollars to the ten
thousand which its business brings it, and it will owe this to
the munificence of the treasury. On the other hand, the peasant,
the laborer, who shall write twice a year to his son in the army,
and shall receive a like number of replies, will have saved ten
cents. Is it not true that the postal reform acts in direct
opposition to the equitable distribution of the tax? that if,
according to M. Chevalier's wish, the government had desired to
strike the rich and spare the poor, the tax on letters was the
last that it would have needed to reduce? Does it not seem that
the treasury, false to the spirit of its institution, has only
been awaiting the pretext of a reduction inappreciable by poverty
in order to seize the opportunity to make a present to wealth?",444,1800s

"As the practice of contracting for black-mail was an obvious
encouragement to rapine, and a great obstacle to the course of justice,
it was, by the statute 1567, chap. 21, declared a capital crime both on
the part of him who levied and him who paid this sort of tax. But the
necessity of the case prevented the execution of this severe law, I
believe, in any one instance; and men went on submitting to a certain
unlawful imposition rather than run the risk of utter ruin--just as it is
now found difficult or impossible to prevent those who have lost a very
large sum of money by robbery, from compounding with the felons for
restoration of a part of their booty. At what rate Rob Roy levied black-mail I never heard stated; but there is
a formal contract by which his nephew, in 1741, agreed with various
landholders of estates in the counties of Perth, Stirling, and Dumbarton,
to recover cattle stolen from them, or to pay the value within six months
of the loss being intimated, if such intimation were made to him with
sufficient despatch, in consideration of a payment of L5 on each L100 of
valued rent, which was not a very heavy insurance. Petty thefts were not
included in the contract; but the theft of one horse, or one head of
black cattle, or of sheep exceeding the number of six, fell under the
agreement.",7023,1700s

"It was with some difficulty that he prevailed. He parted with Sir Herbert; and, struck at the moment with his
highly-raised colour, and the violent heat and state of excitation
he was in, Ormond again urged him to remember his own health, and his
mother and sister. “I will--I do,” said Sir Herbert; “but it is my duty to think of public
justice before I think of myself.”

The apprehension Ormond felt in quitting Sir Herbert recurred frequently
as he rode on in silence; but he was called into action and it was
dissipated. Ormond spent nearly three hours searching a number of
wretched cabins from which the male inhabitants fled at the approach of
the military, leaving the women and children to make what excuses and
tell what lies they could. This the women and children executed
with great readiness and ability, and in the most pity-moving tones

what he would choose for breakfast. His visitor had, in the first

danger to be apprehended; but he could not now draw back. Convinced he might trust this man, as he could make it his interest to
be faithful, Edward communicated his present situation and future
schemes to Macwheeble. The wily agent listened with apprehension when
he found Waverley was still in a state of proscription; was somewhat
comforted by learning that he had a passport; rubbed his hands with

fortunate that neither of their companions was very observant, or else

Ludlow, in a lower voice, but with even a still more emphatic tone than

George had other affairs on hand; and the author of an essay on
toleration continues to sleep peacefully among the many whom he so
intolerantly helped to slay. [Picture: The Grassmarket] For this _infelix campus_, as it is dubbed in
one of its own inscriptions—an inscription over which Dr. Johnson passed
a critical eye—is in many ways sacred to the memory of the men whom
Mackenzie persecuted. It was here, on the flat tombstones, that the
Covenant was signed by an enthusiastic people. In the long arm of the
church-yard that extends to Lauriston, the prisoners from Bothwell
Bridge—fed on bread and water and guarded, life for life, by vigilant
marksmen—lay five months looking for the scaffold or the plantations. And while the good work was going forward in the Grassmarket, idlers in

"However, by way of furthering your schemes, I send the Chinese
lady, whose beauty I trust will not disturb your repose, for in spite
of your sanctity, I know you can be as gallant as the rest of us, and
possibly this beautiful mandarin may prove to be more lovely in your
eyes, than in those of the husband for whom she is destined; but, in
sober earnestness, I would wish you to be convinced that my intention
is not to attempt payment for the services rendered me, but simply to
evince my sense of their value. There is one beside me at this moment
who has given me a kiss to transmit to you--You will easily guess
who has had the audacity to enlist me into her service upon such an
occasion.”

This was one of the recompenses offered to the duc de la Vauguyon, as a
compensation for the public clamor and dislike which sprung up against
him in consequence of his zeal for my service. At Versailles, the
general ferment was at its height, when it became generally known that I
had triumphed over all obstacles, and that my presentation was certainly
to take place. In the midst of all this the desperate odium fell upon
the duc de la Vauguyon, and a general attack was made upon him: his
virtues, reputation, talents, qualities, were made the subject of blame
and scandal--in a word, he was run down by public opinion. But the
leaders of the cabal were not the less struck by the news of my success,
which sounded in their ears like the falling of a thunder-bolt.",2563,1700s

"What I shall do, is all confusion
and darkness."" The younger Mrs. Sterling was a true good woman; loyal-hearted, willing
to do well, and struggling wonderfully to do it amid her languors and
infirmities; rescuing, in many ways, with beautiful female heroism and
adroitness, what of fertility their uncertain, wandering, unfertile
way of life still left possible, and cheerily making the most of it. A
genial, pious and harmonious fund of character was in her; and withal an
indolent, half-unconscious force of intellect, and justness and delicacy
of perception, which the casual acquaintance scarcely gave her credit
for. Sterling much respected her decision in matters literary; often
altering and modifying where her feeling clearly went against him; and
in verses especially trusting to her ear, which was excellent, while he
knew his own to be worth little. I remember her melodious rich plaintive
tone of voice; and an exceedingly bright smile which she sometimes had,
effulgent with sunny gayety and true humor, among other fine qualities.",1085,1700s

    grant to the House of Representatives of the power to impeach the
    President of the United States; but they are aware that the resort
    to that expedient might, in the present condition of public affairs,
    prove abortive. They see the irreconcilable difference of opinion
    and of action between the legislative and executive departments of
    the government is but sympathetic with the same discordant views and
    feelings among the people. To them alone the final issue of the
    struggle must be left. In sorrow and mortification, under the
    failure of all their labors to redeem the honor and prosperity of
    their country, it is a cheering consolation to them that the
    termination of their own official existence is at hand; that they
    are even now about to return to receive the sentence of their
    constituents upon themselves; that the legislative power of the
    Union, crippled and disabled as it may now be, is about to pass,
    renovated and revivified by the will of the people, into other

great comfort and satisfaction; because he, by this means, comes
to consider, know, and understand that, which otherwise he would

is the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Deity. He then
descends into nature, and acknowledges her for the daughter of God;
and sees, and even feels with his hands, that, which in any other
age, or with a perception less clear, he could never have seen
or felt. He then truly discerns the brutality of that vice into
which they fall, who know not how to subdue their passions, and
those three importunate lusts, which, one would imagine, came
all together into the world with us, in order to keep us in
perpetual anxiety and disturbance. These are, the lust of the
flesh, the lust of honours, and the lust of riches; which are apt
to increase with years in such old persons as do not lead a regular
life; because, in their passage through the stage of manhood,
they did not, as they ought, renounce sensuality and their passions;
and take up with sobriety and reason; virtues which men of a regular
life, did not neglect when they passed through the above-mentioned
stage. For, knowing such passions are such lusts to be inconsistent
with reason, by which they are entirely governed; they, at once,
broke loose from all temptations to vice; and, instead of being

"And as for those Words of _Peter_ aforenamed, where he saith, _Christ
was put to Death in the Flesh, but quickened by the Spirit; by which
also he went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison, which sometime
were Disobedient, when once the Long-suffering of God waited in the Days
of_ Noah, _while the Ark was a preparing, &c._

The Meaning of those Words are as followeth; that Christ was put to
Death in the Body of his own Flesh, this is confessed by most People
that profess the Scriptures of Truth, but very few do truly believe,
that the Soul or Spirit of Christ did die, or was put to Death at all,
notwithstanding the Scripture saith, that _He poured out his Soul unto
Death_; and he himself saith, _His Soul was heavy unto Death_. Therefore
that the Reader may understand what is meant in that Christ was put to
Death in the Flesh but quickened by the Spirit; mind,

I declare, that it was the Soul or Spirit of Christ, which was the
Godhead-life that dwelt in that Body of Flesh and Bone of Christ; for,
as the Scripture saith, _In him all the Fulness of the Godhead dwelt
Bodily_: And this Godhead-life that dwelt in the Body of Christ's Flesh,
it was put to Death in the Body of Christ's Flesh, and the same
Godhead-life that was put to Death in the Body of his Flesh. And when
Christ's Body was crucified upon the Cross, then was the Soul and Life
of Christ, or the Godhead-life did die, and was put to Death in that
Flesh of Christ; for that Flesh of Christ was God become Flesh, as the
Scripture saith; and the Soul and Life of Christ was the Soul and Life
of God. And,

When Christ poured out his Soul unto Death, it was the Godhead Life that
was poured out unto Death; so that the Godhead Spirit was put to Death,
and did die in the Flesh of Christ when he was Crucified. But this
Godhead Life which was put to Death in the Flesh of Christ, it quicken'd
again where it was put to Death, even in the same Flesh where it was put
to Death.",68704,1600s

"Now they command celibacy; they
admit none unless they swear that they will not teach the pure doctrine

concord at the expense of their honor; which, nevertheless, it would
be proper for good pastors to do. They ask only that they would release
unjust burdens which are new and have been received contrary to the
custom of the Church Catholic. It may be that in the beginning there
were plausible reasons for some of these ordinances; and yet they are
not adapted to later times. It is also evident that some were adopted
through erroneous conceptions.",275,1400s

"Well into the early
hours of the morning he was busy going over the articles on the table
one by one, listing their names and writing their properties and
descriptions into a note-book as Long Arrow dictated. “There are things here, Stubbins,” he said as he ended, “which in the
hands of skilled druggists will make a vast difference to the medicine
and chemistry of the world. I suspect that this sleeping-honey by
itself will take the place of half the bad drugs we have had to use so
far. Long Arrow has discovered a pharmacopæia of his own. Miranda was
right: he is a great naturalist.",1154,1800s

"Passing a Mahommedan village, I asked some of the landholders, who
walked along by the side of my elephant, to talk of their grievances,
whether they ever used pigs' dung for manure. They seemed very much
surprised and shocked, and asked how I could suppose that Mahommedans
could use such a thing. ""Come,"" said Bukhtawar Sing, ""do not attempt
to deceive the Resident. He has been all over India, and knows very
well that Mahommedans do not keep or eat pigs; but he knows, also,
that there is no good cultivator in Oude who does not use the dung of
pigs for manure; and you know that there is no other manure, save'
pigeons' dung, that is so good."" ""We often purchase _manure_ from
those who prepare it,"" said the landholders, ""and do not ask
questions about what it may be composed of; but the greater part of
the manure we use is the cow-dung which falls in the season of the
rains, and is stored exclusively for that purpose.",16997,1700s

ornament is but the good or rather bewtifull habite of language and stile
and figuratiue speaches the instrument wherewith we burnish our language
fashioning it to this or that measure and proportion, whence finally
resulteth a long and continuall phrase or maner of writing or speach,
which we call by the name of _stile_: we wil first speake of language;
then of stile, lastly of figure, and declare their vertue and differences,
and also their vse and best application, & what portion in exornation
euery of them bringeth to the bewtifying of this Arte. _CHAP. IIII._

_Of Language._


Speach is not naturall to man sauing for his onely habilitie to speake,
and that he is by kinde apt to vtter all his conceits with sounds and
voyces diuersified many maner of wayes, by meanes of the many & fit
instruments he hath by nature to that purpose, as a broad and voluble
tong, thinne and mouable lippes, teeth euen and not shagged; thick ranged,
a round vaulted pallate, and a long throte, besides an excellent capacitie
of wit that maketh him more disciplinable and imitative than any other
creature: then as to the forme and action of his speach, it commeth to him
by arte & teaching, and by vse or exercise. But after a speach is fully
fashioned to the common vnderstanding, & accepted by consent of a whole
countrey & nation, it is called a language, & receaueth none allowed
alteration, but by extraordinary occasions by little & little, as it were
insensibly bringing in of many corruptions that creepe along with the
time: of all which matters, we haue more largely spoken in our bookes of
the originals and pedigree of the English tong. Then when I say language,
I meane the speach wherein the Poet or maker writeth be it Greek or Latine
or as our case is the vulgar English, & when it is peculiar vnto a
countrey it is called the mother speach of that people: the Greekes terme
it _Idioma_: so is ours at this day the Norman English.",16420,1500s
"It was in vain that the tobacco
monopoly and a number of other immense monopolies were given to the new
company; they could not enable it to meet the proper claims spread among
the public, no matter what trouble might be taken to diminish them at all
hazard and at all loss. It was now necessary to seek other expedients. None could be found
except that of rendering this company a commercial one; this was, under a
gentler name, a name vague and unpretending, to hand over to it the
entire and exclusive commerce of the country. It may be imagined how
such a resolution was received by the public, exasperated by the severe
decree, prohibiting people, under heavy penalties, from having more than
five-hundred livres, in coin, in their possession, subjecting them to
visits of inspection, and leaving them nothing but bank notes to, pay for
the commonest necessaries of daily life. Two things resulted; first,
fury, which day by day was so embittered by the difficulty of obtaining
money for daily subsistence, that it was a marvel all Paris did not
revolt at once, and that the emeute was appeased; second, the Parliament,
taking its stand upon this public emotion, held firm to the end in
refusing to register the edict instituting the new company.",3872,1600s

"But their little triumph was not of long
continuance. M. de Vendome came to Versailles for the ceremony of the
Order on Candlemas-Day. He then learned that he was not to serve, and
that he was no longer to receive general's pay. The blow was violent,
and he felt it to its fullest extent; but, with a prudence that equalled
his former imprudence, he swallowed the pill without making a face,

close."" I stood rigid at the rim of the dark campus, my whole body taut and
quivering, my mind a clean slate upon which the voices wrote. Two of

"As he hurried along its single street, Dust Bin
was in a state of confused and helpless excitement. The three or four
hundred Narakans who made up its population were all in the street or
square. Many of them were carrying their belongings on their shoulders

"I would
remark farther, that were it secured according to the Improvements
of modern Fortification, it would be the strongest Fortress in the
World; _viz._ if the four ancient Ports, formerly inclosed within
its Walls by Booms, were rebuilt; two of which (being not only the
Ornament, but the Defence of old _Byzantium_) held out a Siege
against _Severus_ for the Space of three Years; nor could it ever be
obliged to a Surrender, but by Famine only. For besides the Profits
and Advantages it receives from the _Propontis_ and _Ægean_ Sea,
it holds an absolute Dominion over the _Black Sea_; and by one Door
only, namely by the _Bosporus_, shuts up its Communication with any
other part of the World; for no Ship can pass this Sea, if the Port
thinks fit to dispute their Passage. By which means it falls out,
that all the Riches of the _Black Sea_, whether exported or imported,
are at her Command. And indeed such considerable Exportations are
made from hence of Hydes of all Kinds, of Honey, of Wax, of Slaves,
and other Commodities, as supply a great Part of _Europe_, _Asia_
and _Africa_; and on the other hand, there are imported from those
Places such extraordinary Quantities of Wine, Oil, Corn, and other
Goods without Number, that _Mysia_, _Dacia_, _Pannonia_, _Sarmatia_,
_Mæotis_, _Colchis_, _Spain_, _Albania_, _Cappadocia_, _Armenia_,
_Media_, _Parthia_, and both Parts of _Scythia_, share in the great
Abundance. ’Tis for this Reason, that not only all foreign Nations, if
they would entitle themselves to any Property in the immense Wealth of
the _Black Sea_, but also all Sea Port and Island Towns are obliged
to court the Friendship of this City.",53083,1400s

evils which have been often compared, but never felt before by the same
person at the same time; I confess, to my shame, that still I am more
grieved for her loss than for her change; I cannot think her guilty
enough, to consent to her death: were she living, I should have the
satisfaction to reproach her, and to revenge myself on her by making
her sensible of her injustice; but I shall see her no more, I shall see
her no more; this is the greatest misfortune of all others; would I

neither hate nor love her memory; I am incapable of consolation, and

never see Etouteville; his very name raises horror in me; I know very
well I have no reason of complaint against him; I was to blame in
concealing from him my love for Madam de Tournon; if he had known it,
perhaps he would not have pursued her, perhaps she would not have been
false to me; he came to me to impart his sorrows, and I cannot but pity

particular fact so well as Sir William Waller's) that as early as 1647 the
army had too effectually subverted the just relations between itself and
parliament--not to have suggested fearful anticipations to all discerning
patriots of that unhappy issue which did in reality blight their
prospects. And, when I speak of an 'unhappy issue,' I would be understood
only of the immediate issue: for the remote issue was--the revolution of
1688, as I have already asserted. Neither is it true that even the
immediate issue was 'unhappy' to any extent which can justify the ordinary

a tree of about twenty-five feet high, with a short stem of three feet in
diameter; it much resembles the Pinus cedrus, or cedar of Lebanon, in its
robust horizontal growth; it is found abundantly over the island, and
within a few yards of the sea-beach. The island is formed by a succession
of small hills and intervening valleys; and although the soil is very
poor, being principally a mixture of quartzose sand and a large
proportion of marine exuviae, yet this tree grows to a considerable size,
but covering the surface of the island, gives it a monotonous appearance
which is however occasionally relieved by a spreading undescribed species
of melaleuca (allied to Melaleuca armillaris, Smith) and the more elegant
pittosporum, an arborescent species, also undescribed. In fact, these
three trees constitute the timber of the island. The ground is in some
parts profusely clothed with Spinifex hirsutus, Labil., in which I
detected a new species of xerotes, a round bushy plant growing in large

any other duty of his office, is not consecrated as bishop by these

of those works would have any validity; they would be foolish, childish,
and ridiculous. Thus a Christian, being consecrated by his faith, does
good works; but he is not by these works made a more sacred person, or

of fiddlers to scrape and sing to him wherever he goes, since he takes
such a delight to hear his own praises. I must confess, says another leering rogue, a countryman of his, that
since the grand monarch we have been speaking of, who has all along done
more by his bribing and tricking, than by the conduct of his generals,
or the bravery of his troops, who has plaid at fast and loose with his
neighbours ever since he came to the crown, who has surprised abundance
of towns in his time, and at the next treaty been forced to spue up
those very places he ordered _Te Deum_ to be sung for a few months
before. I must confess, says he, that since in conjunction with a damn’d
mercenary priest, he has forg’d a will for his brother-in-law of
_Spain_, and plac’d his grandson upon that throne, I should think the
rest of Christendom in a very bad condition indeed, if he should be
suffered to go on quietly with his show a few years more: Then for all I
know, he might bid fair to set up a new empire in the west, which he has
been aiming at so long: But if the last advice from the other world
don’t deceive us: If the parliament of _England_ goes on as unanimously
as they have begun, to support their prince in so pious and necessary a
war; in short, if the emperor, the _Dutch_, and the other allies, act
with that vigour and resolution as it becomes them upon this pressing
occasion, I make no question to see this mighty hero plunder’d like the
jay in the fable, of all the fine plumes he has borrow’d, and reduc’d to
so low an ebb, that he shall not find it in his power, tho’ he has never
so much in his will, to disturb the peace of the christian world any
more. And this, continues he, is as favourable an opportunity as we
could desire, to strip him of all his usurpations; for heaven be
praised, _Spain_ at present is a burthen to him, and by grasping at too
much, he’s in a fair way to lose every farthing. Besides, this late
forgery of the will has pluck’d off his old mask, and shews that ’tis an
universal monarchy he intends, and not the repose of _Europe_, which has
been so fortunate a sham to him in all his other treaties; so that the
devil’s in the allies now, if they don’t see thro’ those thin pretences

"Parent maintained his
reputation as host, and with a lofty conversation reviewed the legal
aspect of the situation confronting us. A hasty breakfast over, my
brother asked for mounts for himself and men; and as we were corralling
our remuda, one of the three lads on herd signaled to us from the
mesa’s summit. Catching the nearest horses at hand, and taking our
wrangler with us, we cantered up the slope to our waiting sentinel. “You can’t see them now,” said Burl Van Vedder, our outlook; “but wait
a few minutes and they’ll come up on higher ground. Here, here, you are

"Cautiously stealing from his lurking-place, the young officer emerged
into the open sands, and in a few measured noiseless strides gained the
extremity of the bridge. The dark shadow of something upon its centre
caught his eye, and a low sound like that of a dog lapping met his ear. While his gaze yet lingered on the shapeless object, endeavouring to
give it a character, the clouds which had so long obscured it passed
momentarily from before the moon, and disclosed the appalling truth. It
was a wolf-dog lapping up from the earth, in which they were encrusted,
the blood and brains of the unfortunate Frank Halloway. Sick and faint at the disgusting sight, the young man rested his elbow
on the railing that passed along the edge of the bridge, and, leaning
his head on his hand for a moment, forgot the risk of exposure he
incurred, in the intenseness of the sorrow that assailed his soul.",4912,1700s

"The Venetians were routed by the Dutch, near the
city of Trento, and Roberto da S. Severino, their captain, was slain. After this defeat, the Venetians, with their usual good fortune, made
peace with the Dutch, not as vanquished, but as conquerors, so honorable
were the terms they obtained. About this time, there arose serious troubles in Romagna. Francesco
d'Orso, of Furli, was a man of great authority in that city, and
became suspected by the count Girolamo, who often threatened him. He
consequently, living under great apprehensions, was advised by his
friends to provide for his own safety, by the immediate adoption of such
a course as would relieve him from all further fear of the count.",2464,1400s

schedules, begun in the later stages of the campaign, were carried out. Transport ships were available for the trip to the Russell Islands
beginning on 13 January 1944 and continued until the entire battalion
move was completed on 25 February. The fighting by the 9th Defense Battalion contributed considerably to
the victory of the land forces on New Georgia, and demonstrated the
value of advance base defense. The 9th was in action against Japanese

"Hist._ An eminent
Citizen of _Rome_, says he, nam’d _Studius_, came from thence to
_Constantinople_, where he built a Church to the Memory of St. _John
Baptist_, and that divine Service might be celebrated there with more
Decency and Solemnity, he took some Monks out of the Monastery of
the Ἀκοίμητοι, who were so call’d, because some of them were always
_waking_ to attend divine Worship. The heavenly-minded _Marcellinus_
built them a Monastery, in which they continually sang Hymns to God,
their Society being divided into three Tribes for that Purpose. Thus
far _Nicephorus_. Upon this Occasion _Studius_ was made _Consul_, as
appears by an Inscription over the Gate of his own Monastery, which
runs thus:

  _This Pyle was rais’d by_ Studius’ _bounteous Hand:
  Great Actions greatest Honours should command. In just Acknowledgment, the grateful Town,
  Repay’d the Founder with a_ Consul’s _Gown_.",53083,1400s
"After a split-second's hesitation, she felt his lips warm
on hers. From the corner of her eye she saw a chute dart out of nowhere and
scoop up the broken plastic box from the camp table. They both vanished
again. That was a miracle, too, she supposed; but not nearly as
important as hers. Then the reason of a logical mind asserted its own form of realism:
of course, none of it had happened.",58730,1900s

"The first notice which the writer has been able to obtain of the hot
apple-dumpling women is in Ned Ward's very entertaining work, entitled
""The London Spy,"" first published in 1698. He there states that Pancakes
and ""Diddle, diddle dumplings O!"" were then cried in Rosemary Lane and its
vicinity, commonly called Rag Fair. The representation of a
dumpling-woman, in the reign of Queen Anne, is given by Laroon in his
Cries of London, published 1711. [6]

modern, as there are persons now living who declare them to have been
eaten with great caution, and very rarely admitted to the table.",37817,1700s

But the soldier was obdurate. He motioned his comrade down the road. “Watch at the turn,” he ordered; “he may come back or send some of the
Blues to take us. I’ll stay here and protect the lady.”

Venery, that they can relish nothing but _Virgins_: They destroy, it is
true, a great deal of Beauty, by browsing only upon the Buds. But we ought not to judge of these Men’s Abilities by the Number of
Women they debauch, no more than we should measure the Goodness of a
certain curious Gentleman’s Appetite by his bespeaking several Dozen

their own personal Safety. Young Girls are so giddy, thoughtless, and
unexperienc’d, and withal so fond of the Sport, at their first setting
out, that they seldom escape a Taint; and a Man is not safe in being
constant: Nay, some Men are afraid of venturing even after themselves. By this Means several likely Women, that might do the Publick signal
Service, are in a short Time render’d useless: And, by a modest
Computation, we are put to the Expence of as many virtuous Women in one
Year, as might reasonably serve the Nation six. Now, the _Publick Stews_ will regulate this Affair so precisely, and

circumstance to be neglected on a rainy morning, when there might be
some trouble in finding the sacristan, and we rightly judged this would
lead to the famous crypt, the object of admiration and surprise to
antiquarians. Down a steep inclination we pursued our way towards a dark
nook, and there, through an iron grating, we discovered before us the
subterranean church, of immense size, and in perfect preservation; its
massive pillars and sharpcut capitals, its high-curved roof and circular

talents, and the disagreement of the Christians among themselves,
the crusaders were robbed of all that glory which they had at first
acquired; and, after ninety years, were driven from those places which
they had so honorably and happily recovered. After the death of Urban, Pascal II. became pope, and the empire was

extricating them. Our new-born vigour was nipped in the bud. We were all drenched to the
skin. Two packs containing the miserable remains of our wardrobe, Fred’s
and mine, were lost. The catastrophe produced a good deal of bad
language and bad blood.",497,1800s
"He wondered about that. And a possible
answer came to him. They had been there without a light--feeling their way,
almost--although he knew that they could see in the dark to a certain
extent. He wondered at their courage. Here, with two lights, the staring
darkness and the silent empty spaces were making him shaky.",25270,1900s

was born in the old Thomas Thaxter mansion that was built by the settler

"And on account of the diphthong,
grammarians do not derive it from _liteh_, which signifies prayers,
but from public goods, which they call _leita_, so that _leitourgeoh_
means, I attend to, I administer public goods. Ridiculous is their inference that, since mention is made in the Holy
Scriptures of an altar, therefore the Mass must be a sacrifice; for
the figure of an altar is referred to by Paul only by way of
comparison. And they fabricate that the Mass has been so called from
_mzbh_, an altar. What need is there of an etymology so far fetched,
unless it be to show their knowledge of the Hebrew language? What
need is there to seek the etymology from a distance, when the term
Mass is found in Deut.",6744,1400s

it hadn’t been for him, I shouldn’t hae had a tatie to put in my

moving now: upon my life I must. Parson Thirdly will be waiting at the
church gates, and there’s the woman a-biding outside in the waggon.”

"And as the first
part of his life was sensual and irregular, the second should be
the reverse; since nothing can subsist without order, especially the
life of man, irregularity being without all doubt prejudicial, and
regularity advantageous to the human species. Besides, it is impossible in the nature of things, that the man, who
is bent on indulging his palate and his appetite, should not be
guilty of irregularity. Hence it was that to avoid this vice, as
soon as I found myself arrived at maturer years, I embraced a regular
and sober life. It is, no doubt, true, that I found some difficulty
in compassing it; but, in order to conquer this difficulty, I
beseeched the Almighty to grant me the virtue of sobriety; well
knowing, that he would graciously hear my prayer. Then, considering,
that when a man is about to undertake any thing of importance, which
he knows he can compass, though not without difficulty, he may make
it much easier to himself by being steady in his purpose; I pursued
the same course.",30660,1400s

"{49}  _Or Iambic_? _or Satiric_? {50}  From the first Satire of Persius, line 116, in a description of
Homer’s satire:

    “Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico
    Tangit, et admissus circum præcordia ludit,” &c.

Shrewd Flaccus touches each vice in his laughing friend. Dryden thus
translated the whole passage:—

    “Unlike in method, with concealed design
    Did crafty Horace his low numbers join;
    And, with a sly insinuating grace
    Laughed at his friend, and looked him in the face:
    Would raise a blush where secret vice he found;
    And tickle, while he gently probed the wound;
    With seeming innocence the crowd beguiled,
    But made the desperate passes while he smiled.”

{51}  From the end of the eleventh of Horace’s epistles (Lib. 1):

    Quadrigis petimus bene vivere.",1962,1500s

"He tells us,
_That this Temple is open at Top, to shew the Freedom of the Earth in
her Productions, and that the Walls of it are built of a fine polished
Stone_. He adds farther, _That above the Temple of_ Tellus, _stood
the Temples of_ Ceres _and_ Proserpina, _which were beautified with a
large Collection of fine Paintings, the curious Reliques of preceding
Times, and with Statues no Ways inferior to them, finished in the most
elaborate Manner. The Temples of_ Juno _and_ Pluto, he tells us, _were
situate where the Sea winds off from the Continent; and that nothing
was remaining of them in his Time, but the Names of them only_. He
continues, _That_ Cyrus _in his Expedition against the_ Scythians, _in
Return of the Preparations made against him by the_ Byzantians, _burnt
down the Temple of_ Juno; _and that_ Philip _of_ Macedon, _when he was
carrying on the Siege of_ Byzantium, _and wanted some Materials for
that Purpose, demolished the Temple of_ Pluto; _and that the Names
of each of these Temples still continued: For the Temple of_ Pluto
_was called_ Acra Plutonis, _as was the Temple of_ Juno _called_ Acra
Heræa; _and lastly, that in these Temples, the Youth constantly at
the Beginning and End of the Year, offered their Sacrifices_. It will
appear more probable, that these _Acræ_ were seated on some Eminencies
of the second Hill, rather than in the Plain below it, because there is
not the least Appearance of either of them in that Place: So that when
_Dionysius_ records it, that these _Acræ_ of _Pluto_ and _Juno_, were
situate very near the Sea-Shore, he must intend only that they were
only the _Points_ of some Dock, or Haven.",53083,1400s

"With what infinite transport did he hear the evening
before he was to embark, that a sailor knew the identic lady in
question. The prince scalded his mouth with the tea he was drinking,
broke the old china cup it was in, and which the queen his mother had
given him at his departure from Pekin, and which had been given to her
great great great great grandmother queen Fi by Confucius himself, and
ran down to the vessel and asked for the man who knew his bride. It was
honest Tom O'Bull, an Irish sailor, who by his interpreter Mr. James
Hall, the supercargo, informed his highness that Mr. Bob Oliver of Sligo
had a daughter christened of both his names, the fair miss Bob Oliver. [1]
The prince by the plenitude of his power declared Tom a mandarin of the
first class, and at Tom's desire promised to speak to his brother the
king of Great Ireland, France and Britain, to have him made a peer in
his own country, Tom saying he should be ashamed to appear there without
being a lord as well as all his acquaintance. The prince's passion, which was greatly inflamed by Tom's description of
her highness Bob's charms, would not let him stay for a proper set of
ladies from Pekin to carry to wait on his bride, so he took a dozen of
the wives of the first merchants in Canton, and two dozen virgins as
maids of honour, who however were disqualified for their employments
before his highness got to St. Helena.",14098,1700s
"The manifesto stated the motives for such complaint, alleging that the
Duke had not been at the pains to observe the Treaty of Metz with regard
to the surrender of Harsal, and, as a punishment, his entire sovereignty
would be confiscated. A large army then marched upon Peronne; it had been formed at Saint
Germain, and was divided into two columns. The first went to join the
Duc de Crequi, who occupied Lorraine; the other took up its position near
Sedan, to keep the Flemish and Dutch in check in case of any attempted
rebellion. The Lorraines, in despair, gave themselves up to the Emperor, who, aware
of their fine soldierly qualities, bestowed upon both high posts of
command. They caused great losses to France and keen anxiety to her
King.",3848,1600s
"All I had enjoyed before was only a peace, a gift of
God, but now I received and possessed the God of peace. Yet the
remembrance of my past miseries still brought a fear upon me, lest
nature should find means to take to itself any part therein. As soon as
it wanted to see or taste anything, the Spirit ever watchful crossed
and repelled it. I was far from elevating myself, or attributing to
myself anything of this new state. My experience made me sensible of
what I was.",22269,1600s

"'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none
  Go just alike, yet each believes his own
  In poets as true genius is but rare
  True taste as seldom is the critic share
  Both must alike from Heaven derive their light,
  These born to judge as well as those to write
  Let such teach others who themselves excel,
  And censure freely, who have written well
  Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true [17]
  But are not critics to their judgment too? Yet if we look more closely we shall find
  Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind
  Nature affords at least a glimmering light
  The lines though touched but faintly are drawn right,
  But as the slightest sketch if justly traced
  Is by ill coloring but the more disgraced
  So by false learning is good sense defaced
  Some are bewildered in the maze of schools [26]
  And some made coxcombs nature meant but fools
  In search of wit these lose their common sense
  And then turn critics in their own defense
  Each burns alike who can or cannot write
  Or with a rival's or an eunuch's spite
  All fools have still an itching to deride
  And fain would be upon the laughing side
  If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spite [34]
  There are who judge still worse than he can write. Some have at first for wits then poets passed
  Turned critics next and proved plain fools at last
  Some neither can for wits nor critics pass
  As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass. Those half-learned witlings, numerous in our isle,
  As half-formed insects on the banks of Nile

""The well! Something wrong there, I suppose: well, I will go and

bottom and all the rope out; he looked about him, and then he looked
into the well. Jack, who had become very impatient, had been looking
up some time for the assistance which he expected would have come
sooner; the round face of the farmer occasioned a partial eclipse of
the round disk which bounded his view, just as one of the satellites
of Jupiter sometimes obscures the face of the planet round which he
revolves. ""Here I am,"" cried Jack; ""get me up quick, or I shall be dead""; and
What Jack said was true, for he was quite done up by having been so
long down, although his courage had not failed him.",6629,1700s
"There was something about Sacco that made you think of
swift happy things—a jumping fish, a bird on the wing._

She concluded with a paraphrase of Moore:

_Active labor men have all the dice loaded against them. All labor
is on trial with Nichola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. It is bound
up with all the fight that is going on for the closed shop and the
determinations of the employers to smash the worker’s organizations._

The _New Republic_ in its December 29 issue carried John Beffel’s
article, “Eels and the Electric Chair.” This account of the Plymouth
trial asked for a reversal of Vanzetti’s conviction lest there be
“another conviction which will send him through a little green door
into a wired chamber of death.”

Thus, by the New Year, with the trial scheduled to begin in Dedham
on March 7, 1921, one of the left-liberal magazines most widely
circulated among the intelligentsia of the United States had made
the names of Sacco and Vanzetti at least fleetingly familiar to its
readers. Moore’s case was beginning to gather momentum. Art Shields’

sword, and another by a pike, and was then pursued by four archers, who
followed him into the bedchamber. Perceiving these last, I jumped out of
bed, and the poor gentleman after me, holding me fast by the waist. I
did not then know him; neither was I sure that he came to do me no harm,
or whether the archers were in pursuit of him or me. In this situation I
screamed aloud, and he cried out likewise, for our fright was mutual.",3838,1500s

Posture, as it now stands, with three Statues, one of which, as the
Inhabitants tell you, represents the Master, and the other the Servant,
whom he design’d to correct, if a third Person had not interposed,

there are also the Figures of two Cap-stands, with the same Number of
Men working them, and labouring with those below them, to drag the
_Obelisk_. The Wreaths of the Ropes in particular, are very nicely
cut. If the Reader could apprehend the manner in which this cumbersome
Pillar was erected, I believe he would judge it was done the way, as

"This speech I am obliged to answer, because his lordship has been
pleased to call out for any lord who will assert, that the Dutch have
agreed to concur with us in assisting the queen of Hungary. That all
the provinces of that republick have agreed to assist us, is indeed
not true; nor do I know, my lords, by whom or upon what authority it
was asserted; but the concurrence of the province of Holland, the most
important of all, and whose example the rest seldom delay to follow,
has been obtained, which is sufficient to encourage us to vigorous
resolutions, by which the rest may be animated to a speedy compliance. The concurrence of this province has been already the consequence of
the measures which have been lately pursued; measures from which,
though just and successful, the ministry cannot claim much applause;
because all choice was denied, and they were obliged either to remain
passive spectators of the ruin of Europe, and, by consequence, of
Britain, or to do what they have done. And surely, my lords, that
necessity which deprives them of all claim to panegyrick, will be,
likewise, a sufficient security from censure. There is, indeed, no
reason to fear censure from judges so candid and experienced as your
lordships, to whom it may without difficulty be proved, that the
balance of Europe has already changed its position, and the house of
Bourbon is now not able to preponderate against the other powers.",10352,1700s

Faith, nor to promote the Salvation of their Neighbours, nor to serve

themselves. Which to deal candidly in no more or less intentionally,

The seventh Hill is called the _Xerolophos_, on which stands the Pillar
of _Arcadius_. This Hill is little less than twelve thousand Paces in
Circumference, and contains more than a third Part of the City. The
other two Parts are comprehended in the Compass of the _Promontory_,
which is above twenty thousand Paces in Circumference. By _Paces_, I
would here be thought to mean the ordinary Steps we take in Walking,
which I cannot exactly reduce to a just Mensuration with the _Roman
Pace_, by reason of the Turnings and Windings of the Ways, and the
Differences of Paces, which are longer or shorter, according to the
different Ascents and Descents of the Ground we walk.",53083,1400s
"This youthful devil was a titled lord;
          In manners simple:--naught to be abhorred;

          As yet he'd scarcely ventured to displease:
          Said he, I'd have thee know, I was not born,
          Like clods to labour, dig nor sow the corn;
          A devil thou in me beholdest here,

          The islanders, it seems, had acted wrong;
          And, for their crimes, the pope withdrew his cares;
          Our subjects now you live, the law declares;
          And therefore, fellow, I've undoubted right,
          To take the produce of this field, at sight;
          But I am kind, and clearly will decide
          The year concluded, we'll the fruits divided. What crop, pray tell me, dost thou mean to sow? The clod replied, my lord, what best will grow
          I think is Tousell; grain of hardy fame;
          The imp rejoined, I never heard its name;
          What is it. Tousell, say'st thou?--I agree,
          If good return, 'twill be the same to me;

of undertaking a negotiation for a peace. The King hoped thereby to
disappoint him in his expectations in Flanders, which he never had
approved. Accordingly he sent word back to my brother that he should
accept his proffer of negotiating a peace, and would send him for his
coadjutors, M. de Villeroy and M. de Bellievre. The commission my
brother was charged with succeeded, and, after a stay of seven months in
Gascony, he settled a peace and left us, his thoughts being employed
during the whole time on the means of relieving Cambray, which the
satisfaction he found in being with us could not altogether abate. The peace my brother, made, as I have just mentioned, was so judiciously
framed that it gave equal satisfaction to the King and the Catholics, and
to the King my husband and the Huguenots, and obtained him the affections
of both parties.",3839,1500s
"The death of this wonderful man I should be willing to conceal, did I
not know that every reader will inquire curiously after that fatal hour,

other by nature or by fortune. The duke of Mantua, having received so many proofs of his various merit,
made him tutor to his son Vicentio di Gonzaga, a prince of loose manners
and turbulent disposition. On this occasion it was, that he composed the
comedy in which he exhibited so many different characters with exact
propriety. But his honour was of short continuance; for as he was one
night in the time of Carnival rambling about the streets, with his
guitar in his hand, he was attacked by six men masked. Neither his
courage nor skill in his exigence deserted him: he opposed them with
such activity and spirit, that he soon dispersed them, and disarmed
their leader, who throwing off his mask, discovered himself to be the
prince his pupil.",12050,1700s

"Thursday, _June_ 21, 1599, we set Sail for _Spain_, I having allowed me
a convenient Cabin for my Birds, and Engine, which the Captain would
have persuaded me to have left behind, and it was a Wonder I did not,
but my good Fortune saved my Life, for after two Months Sail we met
with an _English_ Fleet about 10 Leagues from the Island of _Teneriff_,
one of the _Canaries_, famous for a Hill therein called _Pico_, which
is seen at Sea above an hundred Leagues off. We had aboard five Times
their number of Men, all in Health, and were well provided with
Ammunition; yet finding them resolved to fight, and knowing what
infinite Riches we carried, concluded it better if possible to escape,
than by encountering a Crew of desperate Fellows, to hazard not only
our Lives, which a Man of Courage does not value, but the Estates of
many poor Merchants, who I am afraid were undone by the Miscarriage
of this Business. Our Fleet consisted of five Sail, that is, three
Carricks, a Bark, and a Caravel, who coming from St. _Thomas Isle_, had
in an ill Hour overtaken us some Days before. The _English_ had three
Ships well provided, who no sooner spied but presently engaged us, and
changing their Course, endeavoured to bring us under their Lee, which
they might easily do as the Wind then flood, they being light nimble
Vessels, as _English_ Ship's generally are; ours heavy, deep laden,
and foul with the Sea; So our Captain resolved, wisely enough it may
be, not neither valiantly nor fortunately, to fly, commanding us to
disperse ourselves. The Caravel by too much Haste fell upon one of the

her up and entered her, the Caravel sinking before our Eyes.",46591,1500s

regard to the enemies of God’s people, to whom he was as a dragon, a
divine avenger against enemies, a protector of his own. Again consider

"Narrow as the land in this quarter has been held to be, still the
charts and maps lately published by individuals, and by the authority
of the Admiralty, show that it is much narrower than what has hitherto
been calculated upon; and in the particular point under consideration,
very narrow indeed. From the mouth of the River Chopo, opposite the
little island Chepillo in the Pacific, to the bottom of the Gulf of
St. Blas or Mandinga on the Atlantic, is only about 20 miles (some
maps make it still less). In this space, the mountains to the eastward
of the high chain S. of Point Manzanillo and Porto Bello, which give
rise to the Chagres, and its tributary streams, running first      (p. 090)
westward and then north-west into the Atlantic, are again, according
to Captain Lloyd, interrupted and broken, affording thereby a readier
communication between the two great oceans, the Atlantic, and the
Pacific. In an apparently good Spanish map of the Isthmus, upon a
large scale, the River Chopo or Bayano is represented as being formed
by two branches, one under the name of the Rio Canizas, springing to
the southward of the Pico de Carti, a hill only four miles from the
Atlantic, in the Bay of Mandinga; the whole course of the river to the
Pacific on a general south bearing, being only 22 miles. The source of
the Chagres comes within 15 miles of the lower course of the Chopo;
and some good maps lay down a river which joins the Chopo, near its
mouth, as coming from the N. E., its sources likewise being within a
very few miles of the Atlantic.",20702,1700s

his own naval force, went in person to meet the Genoese, and coming up
with them near the island of Ponzio, an engagement ensued, in which the
Aragonese were defeated, and Alfonso, with many of the princes of his
suite, made prisoners, and sent by the Genoese to the Filippo. This victory terrified the princes of Italy, who, being jealous of the
duke's power, thought it would give him a great opportunity of being
sovereign of the whole country. But so contrary are the views of men,
that he took a directly opposite course. Alfonso was a man of
great sagacity, and as soon as an opportunity presented itself
of communicating with Filippo, he proved to him how completely he
contravened his own interests, by favoring René and opposing himself;
for it would be the business of the former, on becoming king of Naples,
to introduce the French into Milan; that in an emergency he might have
assistance at hand, without the necessity of having to solicit a passage
for his friends. But he could not possibly secure this advantage without
effecting the ruin of the duke, and making his dominions a French

"I was rather amused by this romantic, though
incorrect, figure; but I let him proceed: ""I've got several places, but
lost 'em all. I think there's a spell upon me; and who can struggle
against his fate?"" I tried to console him, and found, upon a further confession, that he had
flown to spirits ""now and then,"" to blunt the sharp tooth of mental
misery. Here, then, was the chief cause of his want of success, which he blindly
attributed to fate--the common failing of all weak minds. For my part,
notwithstanding the imperial authority of the great Napoleon himself, I
have no faith in Fate, believing that the effect, whether good or bad,
may invariably be traced to some cause in the conduct of the individual,
as certainly as the loss of a man, in a game of draughts, is the
consequence of a ""wrong move"" by the player!--And poor Matthew's
accusation of Fate put me in mind of the school-boy, who, during a wet
vacation, rushed vindictively at the barometer, and struck it in the
face, exclaiming--""Only three holidays left, and still this plaguey glass
says 'very wet;'--I can't bear it--I can't--and I won't.""",5649,1700s

"Three parts of the city were now in
the hands of the people, and only one in possession of the nobility; but
this was the strongest, as well on account of those who held it, as from
its situation, being defended by the Arno; hence it was first necessary
to force the bridges. The Old Bridge was first assailed and offered a
brave resistance; for the towers were armed, the streets barricaded,
and the barricades defended by the most resolute men; so that the
people were repulsed with great loss. Finding their labor at this point
fruitless, they endeavored to force the Rubaconte Bridge, but no
better success resulting, they left four Gonfalons in charge of the two
bridges, and with the others attacked the bridge of the Carraja. Here,
although the Nerli defended themselves like brave men, they could not
resist the fury of the people; for this bridge, having no towers,
was weaker than the others, and was attacked by the Capponi, and many
families of the people who lived in that vicinity. Being thus assailed
on all sides, they abandoned the barricades and gave way to the people,
who then overcame the Rossi and the Frescobaldi; for all those beyond
the Arno took part with the conquerors.",2464,1400s

"And as
there was not any old malignity in my humours (which is the thing
that kills people) but only that, which my new irregularity had
occasioned, this fit of sickness, though exceeding violent, had
not the strength to destroy me. This it was, and nothing else,
that saved my life; whence may be gathered, how great is the
power and efficacy of regularity; and how great, likewise, is
that of irregularity, which in a few days could bring on me so
terrible a fit of sickness, just as regularity had preserved me
in health for so many years. And it appears to me a no weak argument, that, since the world,
consisting of the four elements, is upheld by order; and our
life, as to the body, is no other than a harmonious combination
of the same four elements, so it should be preserved and maintained
by the very same order; and, on the other hand, it must be worn
out by sickness, or destroyed by death, which are produced by the
contrary effects. By order the arts are more easily learned; by
order armies are rendered victorious; by order, in a word,
families, cities, and even states are maintained. Hence I
concluded, that orderly living is no other than a most certain
cause and foundation of health and long life; nay I cannot help
saying, that it is the only and true medicine; and whoever weighs
the matter well, must also conclude, that this is really the case.",30660,1400s

"Then a foul wind, S.E., increased into a gale,
lasting five days, during which orders were given in dumb show, as no
one’s voice could be heard; through it we fought and laboured and dipped
under water, and I only had my dry corner by the wheel, where the kind
pleasant little third officer lashed me tight. It was far more
formidable than the first gale, but less beautiful; and we made so much
lee-way that we lost ten days, and only arrived here yesterday. I
recommend a fortnight’s heavy gale in the South Atlantic as a cure for a
_blasé_ state of mind. It cannot be described; the sound, the sense of
being hurled along without the smallest regard to ‘this side uppermost’;
the beauty of the whole scene, and the occasional crack and bear-away of
sails and spars; the officer trying to ‘sing out’, quite in vain, and the
boatswain’s whistle scarcely audible. I remained near the wheel every
day for as long as I could bear it, and was enchanted.",886,1800s

"No vestige of anger, of condemnation of the inhuman
being seated in the ebony chair, remained; that was past. Of all that
had gone before, and of what was to come in the future, I thought
nothing, knew nothing. Our long fight against the yellow group, our
encounters with the numberless creatures of Fu-Manchu, the dacoits--even
Karamaneh--were forgotten, blotted out. I saw nothing of the strange
appointments of that subterranean chamber; but face to face with the
supreme moment of a lifetime, I was alone with my poor friend--and God. The rats began squealing again.",1183,1800s
"But widely different is the state of information at this day. That
revolution itself, dreadful as it was, has awakened the whole
continent from the sleep of ages, and put them upon inquiry into the
foundations of government, and the purposes for which it was ordained:
and during nearly half a century which has since elapsed, a degree
of light has been thrown upon the great subject of the rights of
man which has found its way into every hamlet and every cottage of
southern Europe, and is advancing to the north with such increasing
lustre as will ere long scatter the gloom that yet hangs over Siberia
and Kamschatka. Hence the people of France, certainly, and perhaps
of the whole south of Europe, are now prepared for the temperate
enjoyment of liberty, under the administration of a regular
government, for which they were totally unfitted in 1789. There is another striking difference between the cases, and a most
important one it is, as it affects the question before us. France has now the benefit of her own past experience before her eyes:
she had no such lamp to light her steps in 1789.",28053,1700s

"But what delights me most, is, in my journies
backwards and forwards, to contemplate the situation and other
beauties of the places I pass through; some in the plain, others
on hills, adjoining to rivers or fountains; with a great many fine
houses and gardens. Nor are my recreations rendered less agreeable
and entertaining by my not feeling well, or not hearing readily
every thing that is said to me; or by any other of my faculties not
being perfect; for they are all, thank God, in the highest
perfection; particularly my palate, which now relishes better the
simple fare I eat, wherever I happen to be, than it formerly did
with the most delicate dishes, when I led an irregular life. Nor
does the change of beds give me any uneasiness, so that I sleep
every where soundly and quietly, without experiencing the least
disturbance; and all my dreams are pleasant and delightful. It is likewise with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction I behold
the success of an undertaking so important to this state, I mean
that of draining and improving so many uncultivated pieces of
ground, an undertaking begun within my memory; and which I never
thought I should live to see compleated; knowing how slow republics
are apt to proceed in enterprises of great importance. Nevertheless, I have lived to see it; and was even in person, in
the marshy places, along with those appointed to superintend the
draining of them, for two months together, during the greatest
heats of summer, without ever finding myself the worse for the
fatigues of inconveniences I suffered; of so much efficacy is that
orderly life, which I every where constantly lead.",30660,1400s

"Grant, Heaven, I may
soon have an opportunity of expostulating with the tyrant upon that
subject."" So saying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes lightened with resentment. Then he thus proceeded: ""My coming hither to-day was with a view to visit
a poor female relation, from whom I yesterday received a letter,
describing her most deplorable situation, and soliciting my assistance;
but the turnkey affirms that there is no such person in the jail, and I
was on my way to consult the keeper, when I was agreeably surprised with
the sight of my dear Fathom."" Our adventurer having wiped from his eyes the tears which were produced
by the news of his worthy patron's death, desired to know the name of
that afflicted prisoner, in whose behalf he interested himself so much,
and Renaldo produced the letter, subscribed, ""Your unfortunate cousin,
Helen Melvil."" This pretended relation, after having explained the
degree of consanguinity which she and the Count stood in to each other,
and occasionally mentioned some anecdotes of the family in Scotland, gave
him to understand that she had married a merchant of London, who, by
repeated losses in trade, had been reduced to indigence, and afterwards
confined to prison, where he then lay a breathless corpse, having left
her in the utmost extremity of wretchedness and want, with two young
children in the smallpox, and an incurable cancer in one of her own
breasts.",6760,1700s

why even civil righteousness is rare among men, as we see that not
even the philosophers themselves, who seem to have aspired after this
righteousness, attained it. But it is false to say that he who
performs the works of the commandments without grace does not sin. And they add further that such works also merit _de congruo_ the

Indians caught me, and showed how I ran--like a bird flying. They
appeared to be very well pleased with me, and I felt as comfortable as
the nature of the case would admit of. The next morning after breakfast, they all left that camp; they put all

infinitely superior to anybody's, I would have you read his works, which
you have, over and-over again, with particular attention to his style. Transcribe, imitate, emulate it, if possible: that would be of real use
to you in the House of Commons, in negotiations, in conversation; with
that, you may justly hope to please, to persuade, to seduce, to impose;

"Every species of wilful deceit, as the use of ambiguities in language
for the purpose of misleading; the adoption of expressions which we know
to be understood by another in a different sense from what we really mean;
mental reservations; a studied suppression of part of the truth, as in the
present example, is unworthy the character of any person who professes to
be an honest man, much more of one who sustains the dignified character of
a Christian. ""Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth with
his neighbour."" In theory, it seems an easy thing to adhere to truth; but it is too
frequently found difficult in practice. When motives of interest are
balanced against motives of duty, it is well if the former do not
sometimes preponderate. Are we always careful to state facts _exactly_ as

earning only eight or ten dollars a month clear of her board, and could
afford herself but one ""best dress,"" besides her working clothes. That
best dress was often nothing but a Merrimack print. But she insisted
that it was a great saving of trouble to have just this one, because
she was not obliged to think what she should wear if she were invited

give an answer to all those who, taking offence at the word of faith and
at what I have asserted, say, ""If faith does everything, and by itself
suffices for justification, why then are good works commanded? Are we
then to take our ease and do no works, content with faith?"" Not so,

"We found the Queen in bed with her curtains undrawn, the chamber not
disposed with the pomp and ceremonies of our religion, but after the
simple manner of the Huguenots; that is to say, there were no priests, no
cross, nor any holy water. We kept ourselves at some distance from the
bed, but Madame de Nevers, whom you know the Queen hated more than any
woman besides, and which she had shown both in speech and by
actions,--Madame de Nevers, I say, approached the bedside, and, to the
great astonishment of all present, who well knew the enmity subsisting
betwixt them, took the Queen's hand, with many low curtseys, and kissed
it; after which, making another curtsey to the very ground, she retired
and rejoined us. A few months after the Queen's death, the Prince of Navarre, or rather,
as he was then styled, the King, came to Paris in deep mourning, attended
by eight hundred gentlemen, all in mourning habits. He was received with
every honour by King Charles and the whole Court, and, in a few days
after his arrival, our marriage was solemnised with all possible
magnificence; the King of Navarre and his retinue putting off their
mourning and dressing themselves in the most costly manner. The whole
Court, too, was richly attired; all which you can better conceive than I
am able to express.",3838,1500s

portfolio which Louis XVI. had placed under her care. When Napoleon read

"Wherefore the function
of this Council, which is very rare in a senate, was executive, and
consisted in the administration of the law made; and whereas the Council
itself is often understood in Scripture by the priest and the Levite,
there is no more in that save only that the priests and the Levites,
who otherwise had no power at all, being in the younger years of this
commonwealth, those that were best studied in the laws were the most
frequently elected into the Sanhedrim. For the courts, consisting of
three-and-twenty elders sitting in the gates of every city, and the
triumvirates of judges constituted almost in every village, which were
parts of the executive magistracy subordinate to the Sanhedrim, I shall
take them at better leisure, and in the larger discourse; but these
being that part of this commonwealth which was instituted by Moses upon
the advice of Jethro the priest of Midian (as I conceive a heathen), are
to me a sufficient warrant even from God himself, who confirmed them,
to make further use of human prudence, wherever I find it bearing a
testimony to itself, whether in heathen commonwealths or others; and the
rather, because so it is, that we who have the holy Scriptures, and in
them the original of a commonwealth, made by the same hand that made
the world, are either altogether blind or negligent of it; while the
heathens have all written theirs, as if they had had no other copy; as,
to be more brief in the present account of that which you shall have
more at large hereafter:

Athens consisted of the Senate of the Bean proposing, of the Church or
Assembly of the people resolving, and too often debating, which was the
ruin of it; as also of the Senate of the Areopagus, the nine archons,
with divers other magistrates, executing. Lacedaemon consisted of the Senate proposing, of the Church or
congregation of the people resolving only, and never debating, which was
the long life of it; and of the two kings, the court of the ephors, with
divers other magistrates, executing. Carthage consisted of the Senate proposing and sometimes resolving too,
of the people resolving and sometimes debating too, for which fault she
was reprehended by Aristotle; and she had her suffetes, and her hundred
men, with other magistrates, executing. Rome consisted of the Senate proposing, the concio or people resolving,
and too often debating, which caused her storms; as also of the consuls,
censors, aediles, tribunes, praetors, quaestors, and other magistrates,
executing.",2801,1600s
"But we must always
guard most carefully against any vain confidence or presumption of being
justified, gaining merit, or being saved by these works, this being the
part of faith alone, as I have so often said. Any man possessing this knowledge may easily keep clear of danger among
those innumerable commands and precepts of the Pope, of bishops, of
monasteries, of churches, of princes, and of magistrates, which some
foolish pastors urge on us as being necessary for justification and
salvation, calling them precepts of the Church, when they are not so
at all. For the Christian freeman will speak thus: I will fast, I will
pray, I will do this or that which is commanded me by men, not as having
any need of these things for justification or salvation, but that I
may thus comply with the will of the Pope, of the bishop, of such a
community or such a magistrate, or of my neighbour as an example to him;
for this cause I will do and suffer all things, just as Christ did and
suffered much more for me, though He needed not at all to do so on His
own account, and made Himself for my sake under the law, when He was
not under the law. And although tyrants may do me violence or wrong in
requiring obedience to these things, yet it will not hurt me to do them,
so long as they are not done against God. From all this every man will be able to attain a sure judgment and
faithful discrimination between all works and laws, and to know who
are blind and foolish pastors, and who are true and good ones.",1911,1400s

reigning amongst Men of a lower Size, where there is no Awe to keep a Man

"“Ay, by G----, but I will except, though,” said the fellow with the green
plush jacket: “I will overload my wherry neither for love nor money--I
love my boat as well as my wife, and a thought better.”

“Nay, nay, comrade,” said his mate, “that is speaking no true water
language. For double fare we are bound to row a witch in her eggshell if
she bid us; and so pull away, Jack, and let us have no more prating.”

They got into the stream-way accordingly, and, although heavily laden,
began to move down the river with reasonable speed. The lighter vessels which passed, overtook, or crossed them, in their
course, failed not to assail them with their boisterous raillery, which
was then called water-wit; for which the extreme plainness of Mistress
Martha's features, contrasted with the youth, handsome figure, and good
looks of Nigel, furnished the principal topics; while the circumstance
of the boat being somewhat overloaded, did not escape their notice. They
were hailed successively, as a grocer's wife upon a party of pleasure
with her eldest apprentice--as an old woman carrying her grandson to
school--and as a young strapping Irishman, conveying an ancient maiden
to Dr. Rigmarole's, at Redriffe, who buckles beggars for a tester and
a dram of Geneva. All this abuse was retorted in a similar strain of
humour by Greenjacket and his companion, who maintained the war of wit
with the same alacrity with which they were assailed.",5950,1700s

  Beyond the path of the outmost sun through utter darkness hurled --
  Further than ever comet flared or vagrant star-dust swirled --
  Live such as fought and sailed and ruled and loved and made our world. They are purged of pride because they died, they know the worth of their bays,
  They sit at wine with the Maidens Nine and the Gods of the Elder Days,
  It is their will to serve or be still as fitteth our Father's praise. 'Tis theirs to sweep through the ringing deep where Azrael's outposts are,
  Or buffet a path through the Pit's red wrath when God goes out to war,
  Or hang with the reckless Seraphim on the rein of a red-maned star.",323,1800s

"Garus was awaked and called. Seeing this disorder, he cried that a
purgative had been given, and whatever it might be, it was poison in the
state to which the princess was now reduced. He wished to depart, he was
detained, he was taken to Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans. Then followed a
great uproar, cries from Garus, impudence and unequalled hardihood of
Chirac, in defending what he had done. He could not deny it, for the two nurses had been questioned, and had
told all.",3872,1600s

"As long as nineteen men claim the right in
any sense or shape to take hold of the twentieth man and make him even
mildly uncomfortable, so long the whole proceeding must be a humiliating
one for all concerned. And the proof of how poignantly men have always
felt this lies in the fact that the headsman and the hangman, the
jailors and the torturers, were always regarded not merely with fear but
with contempt; while all kinds of careless smiters, bankrupt knights
and swashbucklers and outlaws, were regarded with indulgence or even
admiration. To kill a man lawlessly was pardoned. To kill a man lawfully
was unpardonable. The most bare-faced duelist might almost brandish his
weapon.",1717,1800s
"To-morrow [not to-morrow,
nor next day; wet troops need a rest] I arrive at our last station this
side Glogau, which place I hope to get in a few days. All favors my
designs: and I hope to return to Berlin, after executing them gloriously
and in a way to be content with. Let the ignorant and the envious talk;
it is not they that shall ever serve as loadstar to my designs; not
they, but Glory [LA GLOIRE; Fame, depending not on them]: with the love
of that I am penetrated more than ever; my troops have their hearts big
with it, and I answer to thee for success. Adieu, dear Jordan. Write me
all the ill that the public says of thy Friend, and be persuaded that I
love and will esteem thee always.""--F.",2112,1700s

"I Know not whether or no Women are allow’d to have Souls; if they have,
perhaps it is not prudent to provoke them too much, lest, silly as they
are, they at last recriminate, and then what polite and well-bred
Gentleman, though himself is concern’d, can forbear taking that lawful
Pleasure, which all who understand Raillery must taste, when they find
his Jests who insolently began to peck at his Neighbour, return’d with
Interest upon his own Head? And indeed Men are too Humane, too Wise, to
venture at it, did they not hope for this Effect, and expect the
Pleasure of finding their Wit turn to such Account: For if it be lawful
to pry into a Secret, this is, without doubt, the whole Design of those
fine Discourses which have been made against the Women from our great
Fore-Fathers to this present Time! Generous Man has too much Bravery, he
is too Just and too Good to assault a defenceless Enemy, and if he did
inveigh against the Women, it was only to do them Service! For since
neither his Care of their Education, his hearty Endeavours to improve
their Minds, his wholesome Precepts, nor great Example could do them
good, as his last and kindest Essay, he resolv’d to try what Contempt
would do, and chose rather to expose himself by a seeming Want of
Justice, Equity, Ingenuity and Good-nature, than suffer Women to remain
such vain and insignificant Creatures as they have hitherto been
reckon’d; and truly, Women are some Degrees beneath what I have thus far
thought them, if they do not make the best Use of his Kindness, improve
themselves, and, like Christians, return it. Let us see then what is their Part, what must they do to make the
Matrimonial Yoke tolerable to themselves as well as pleasing to their
Lords and Masters?",61143,1600s

"Lady Ardagh, however, did not suffer from this change further than in
being secluded from general society; for Sir Robert's wealth, and the
hospitality which he had established in the family mansion, commanded
that of such of his lady's friends and relatives as had leisure or
inclination to visit the castle; and as their style of living was very
handsome, and its internal resources of amusement considerable, few
invitations from Sir Robert or his lady were neglected. Many years passed quietly away, during which Sir Robert's and Lady
Ardagh's hopes of issue were several times disappointed. In the lapse of
all this time there occurred but one event worth recording. Sir Robert
had brought with him from abroad a valet, who sometimes professed
himself to be French, at others Italian, and at others again German. He
spoke all these languages with equal fluency, and seemed to take a kind
of pleasure in puzzling the sagacity and balking the curiosity of such
of the visitors at the castle as at any time happened to enter into
conversation with him, or who, struck by his singularities, became
inquisitive respecting his country and origin.",509,1800s

"When the Devil tempted our Saviour in
the wilderness, and could not prevail, he went away and left him: The
prince of this world found nothing in him, upon which he could fasten
his temptation. Christ will enable those that believe in him to overcome
the Devil, and to be more than conquerors, through him that loved them:
He came into the world to purge and purify his people, and to be the
author of eternal salvation to all them that believe in him, and obey
him. But it is said, ""He did not many mighty works"" among some to whom
he preached the everlasting Gospel, because of their unbelief: Many will
not believe in the inward and spiritual appearance of Jesus Christ the
Son of God, who is the light of the world; they will neither believe in
the light, nor walk in the light, which will enable them to conquer the
evil one, who is the prince of darkness: It is only through Christ
Jesus, the great captain of our salvation, that we are victorious. Therefore, my friends, open your hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ,
receive this blessed gift of God which he offers to you: And can God
give you a greater gift than the Son of his Love? And will not you
gladly receive him, and that great salvation which he hath purchased for
you with his own blood!",20534,1600s

the ebbing stream of his life--what could be more delightful? II. Witch Martha lived in a small lonely cottage down by the river. Very few
people ever went to see her in the day-time; but at night she often had
visitors. Mothers who suspected that their children were changelings,
whom the Trolds had put in the cradle, taking the human infants away;
girls who wanted to “turn the hearts” of their lovers, and lovers who
wanted to turn the hearts of the girls; peasants who had lost money
or valuables and wanted help to trace the thief--these and many
others sought secret counsel with Witch-Martha, and rarely went away
uncomforted.",784,1800s

"That it was
lamentable we had so little; and that instead of taking _faith_ for
the rule of their conduct, men amused themselves with trivial
devotions, which changed daily. That the way of Faith was the spirit
of the Church, and that it was sufficient to bring us to a high degree
of perfection. That we ought to give ourselves up to GOD, with regard both to things
temporal and spiritual, and seek our satisfaction only in the
fulfilling of His will, whether he lead us by suffering or by
consolation, for all would lie equal to a soul truly resigned. That
there needed fidelity in those dryness, or insensibilities and
irksomenesses in prayer, by which GOD tries our love to him; that
_then_ was the time for us to make good and effectual acts of
resignation, whereof one alone would oftentimes very much promote our
spiritual advancement. That as for the miseries and sins he heard of daily in the world, he
was so far from wondering at them, that, on the contrary, he was
surprised that there were not more, considering the malice sinners
were capable of; that for his part he prayed for them; but knowing
that GOD could remedy the mischiefs they did when He pleased, he gave
himself no farther trouble.",13871,1600s
"What have you decided to do?”

“The drumming seems to be moving away. Will you follow it, Maskull?”

“Yes.”

“But where will it take us?”

“Perhaps out of Threal altogether.”

“It sounds to me more real than reality,” said Corpang. “Tell me, who is
Surtur?”

“Surtur’s world, or Muspel, we are told, is the original of which this
world is a distorted copy. Crystalman is life, but Surtur is other than
life.”

“How do you know this?”

“It has sprung together somehow—from inspiration, from experience, from
conversation with the wise men of your planet. Every hour it grows truer
for me and takes a more definite shape.”

Corpang stood up squarely, facing the three Figures with a harsh,
energetic countenance, stamped all over with resolution.",1329,1800s
"It does not believe that Christ
is Propitiator; it does not believe that by faith we freely attain
that we are accounted righteous for Christ's sake. And, nevertheless,
since works cannot pacify the conscience, others are continually
chosen, new rites are performed, new vows made, and new orders of
monks formed beyond the command of God, in order that some great work
may be sought which may be set against the wrath and judgment of God. Contrary to Scripture, the adversaries uphold these godless opinions
concerning works. But to ascribe to our works these things, namely,
that they are a propitiation, that they merit the remission of sins
and grace that for the sake of these and not by faith for the sake of
Christ as Propitiator we are accounted righteous before God, what
else is this than to deny Christ the honor of Mediator and
Propitiator? Although, therefore, we believe and teach that good
works must necessarily be done (for the inchoate fulfilling of the
Law ought to follow faith), nevertheless we give to Christ His own
honor.",6744,1400s
"Barbezieux, informed by his spies of the departure of the messenger,
waylaid him, bribed him, and induced him to act with the blackest
perfidy, by telling the King quite a different story to that he was
charged with. In this way, the project for the siege of Barcelona was
entirely broken, at the moment for its execution, and with the most
reasonable hopes of success; and upon M. de Noailles rested all the
blame. What a thunderbolt this was for him may easily be imagined. But
the trick had been so well played, that he could not clear himself with
the King; and all through this winter he remained out of favour. At last he thought of a means by which he might regain his position.",3860,1600s

clashing of gears shifting on a hill squashed his voice. He spoke

last century but the bitter, and ever to be deplored affliction with
which this new era opened to our family, in depriving us of the darling
of our hearts,[4] at the very moment--when--after a grievous absence, we
believed her restored to us, cast it from my thoughts, and even from my
powers, for many years. I took with me, nevertheless, my prepared
materials in the year 1802, to France; where, ultimately, though only at
odd intervals, I sketched the whole work; which, in the year 1812,
accompanied me back to my native land. And, to the honour and liberality

his fright might impel him to do. I could see him casting longing
glances at the small skiff towing astern, so in the next calm I hauled
the skiff alongside. As I did so his eyes brightened with hope; but

to rock and almost to roar. Storm was certainly coming. “When that Indian spoke to us,” went on Brown in a conversational

    And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
    To tread down fair respect of sovereignty. It is this exceeding vivacity of imagination which in the end turns
sorrow to frenzy. Constance is not only a bereaved and doating mother,
but a generous woman, betrayed by her own rash confidence; in whose mind
the sense of injury mingling with the sense of grief, and her impetuous
temper conflicting with her pride, combine to overset her reason; yet
she is not mad: and how admirably, how forcibly she herself draws the
distinction between the frantic violence of uncontrolled feeling and
actual madness!--

    Thou art not holy to belie me so;

"They, therefore, determined to

there would be no doubt of his presence, and where they might, under
various pretexts, assemble their friends. It was also resolved that
if one of their number were prevented from attending, on any account
whatever, the rest should put him to death in the midst of their armed
enemies. It was now the close of the year 1476, near Christmas, and as it was
customary for the duke to go upon St. Stephen's day, in great solemnity,
to the church of that martyr, they considered this the most suitable
opportunity for the execution of their design. Upon the morning of that
day they ordered some of their most trusty friends and servants to arm,
telling them they wished to go to the assistance of Giovanandrea,
who, contrary to the wish of some of his neighbors, intended to turn a
watercourse into his estate; but that before they went they wished to
take leave of the prince. They also assembled, under various

was accomplished, everyone would join them in the completion of their

"Now after it was known that _Irdonozur_ the great Monarch had done me
this Honour, it is strange how much all respected me more than before;
my Guardians, who had been hitherto cautious in relating any thing of
the Government of that World, grew now more open, so that from them
and _Pylonas_ together I understood many notable Particulars; as that
in a thousand Years there is found neither Thief nor Whore-monger, for
first there is no want of any thing necessary for the Use of Man, food
growing every where without Labour, of all Sorts that can be desired. As for Cloths, Houses, or whatever else a Man may be supposed to want,
it is provided by their Superiors, though not without some Labour,
but yet so easy as if they did it for Pleasure: Again, their Females
are all absolute Beauties, and by a secret Disposition of Nature, a
Man there having once known a Woman never desires any other: Murther
was never heard of amongst them, neither is it hardly possible to be
committed, for there can be no Wound made but what is curable; yea
they assured me, and for my Part I believe it, that though a Man's
Head be cut off, yet if within three Moons it be joined to the Carcase
again, and the Juice of a certain Herb there growing applied, it will
be so consolidated, as the wounded Party shall be perfectly cured. But
the chief Cause of their good Government is an excellent Disposition
in the Nature of the People, so that all both Old and Young hate all
manner of Vice, and live in such Love, Peace, and Amity, as it seems
to be another Paradise: Though it is true likewise that some are of
a better Disposition than others, which they discern immediately at
their Birth; and because it is an inviolable Law amongst them that none
shall be put to Death; therefore perceiving by their Stature or some
other Signs, who are like to be of a wicked and debauched Humour, they
send them, I know not by what Means, into the Earth, and change them
for other Children, before they have either Opportunity or Ability to
do amiss among them; but first, they say, they are fain to keep them
there for some Time, till the Air of the Earth alters their Colour like
ours. Their ordinary Vent for them is a certain high Hill in the North
of _America_, whose People, I am apt to believe, are wholly descended
from them, both in regard of their Colour, and their continual use
of Tobacco, which the _Lunars_ or _Moon Men_ smoak exceedingly, the
Place abounding much with Moisture, together with the Pleasure they
take therein, and some other Respects too long to rehearse: Sometimes,
though but seldom, they mistake their Aim, and fall upon _Europe_,
_Asia_, or _Africa_. I remember some Years since I read certain Stories
tending to confirm what is related by these _Lunars_, and especially
one Chapter of _Neubrigensis_.",46591,1500s
"In that one moment
all my wrongs come into my mind; all the insults that that man and the
scoundrel his brother, there, had put upon me, and how they laid in

_drive_ me to some deed that would destroy me and my family that hadn’t
ever done _them_ no harm, so help me God! And they done it in a mean
revenge—for why? Because my innocent pure girl here at my side wouldn’t
marry that rich, insolent, ignorant coward, Brace Dunlap, who’s been
sniveling here over a brother he never cared a brass farthing for—” [I
see Tom give a jump and look glad _this_ time, to a dead certainty]
“—and in that moment I’ve told you about, I forgot my God and
remembered only my heart’s bitterness, God forgive me, and I struck to

I thought of my poor family, and I _must_ hide what I’d done for their
sakes; and I did hide that corpse in the bushes; and presently I
carried it to the tobacker field; and in the deep night I went with my
shovel and buried it where—”

thigh-bones was preserved by the Viscount of Falaise, who was there with
him, and begged it from the rioters, and that this bone was longer by
four fingers' breadth than that of a tall man. The bone thus preserved,
was re-interred, after the cessation of the troubles: it is the same
that is alluded to in the inscription, which also informs us that a
monument was raised over it in 1642, but was removed in 1742, it being

II


So many people have asked me,

“What are you doing this for?”

“Is there any money to be made grinding corn?”

“What are you ever going to do with this useless old building?”

And most people, when they get an answer, sadly walk away shaking their
heads, wondering. I suppose no one person or no one episode gave rise to my thought in
acquiring the mill and entering upon a program of restoration, unless
it could be what I have heard in the various entertaining stories of
people such as C. Milton Chase, Dean of the Massachusetts Town Clerks,
and retired Town Clerk of Barnstable, who tells most engaging tales of
his trips as a young lad to the mill with a horse and team, carrying
corn to be ground. Perhaps I was fired by my friend, George Kelley, a ponderous,
phlegmatic, Cape Codder, attempting to perpetuate some of the
characters of old Cape Cod, personified in Joe Lincoln’s stories; and
perhaps by the stories of Walter B. Chase and Howard Hinckley of their
nostalgic remembrances of the old mill. If you ever meet Milton Chase, see if you can get him to tell you of
the adventures, and strange doings of an old-time travelling barber,
one Frank Clifford, who went around to all the business places, livery
stables, and grain stores with his little black bag, plying his barber
trade, and who employed a most ingenious method of warming the shaving
lather for his customers.",71957,1900s
"I thought it very expedient at this time to give you this candid
counsel; and with this counsel I would willingly close, if the matters
which at various times have been objected to me in this city concerned
only myself and my own election. These charges, I think, are four in
number: my neglect of a due attention to my constituents, the not paying
more frequent visits here; my conduct on the affairs of the first Irish
Trade Acts; my opinion and mode of proceeding on Lord Beauchamp's
Debtors' Bills; and my votes on the late affairs of the Roman Catholics. All of these (except perhaps the first) relate to matters of very
considerable public concern; and it is not lest you should censure me
improperly, but lest you should form improper opinions on matters of
some moment to you, that I trouble you at all upon the subject. My
conduct is of small importance. With regard to the first charge, my friends have spoken to ms of it in
the style of amicable expostulation,--not so much blaming the thing as
lamenting the effects.",15198,1700s
"I believe not. In conclusion, I would
urge on all owners and occupiers of land, the importance of
devoting at least a small field to agricultural experiments, as I
think there can be no doubt that, if these are carefully and
systematically made and followed up by agriculturists generally,
we shall be so far from needing an importation of corn in average
years that we shall have a large surplus to spare for our
neighbours. NOTE.--In the use of silicates of soda and potash one precaution
is very necessary--viz., that you really have a soluble silicate,
and not a mere mechanical mixture of ground flint and soda: this
is a very different thing, and one, if it be not carefully guarded
against, which will lead to nothing but disappointment. Again, the
silicate may be properly made in the first place, but in a long
exposure to the atmosphere the soda attracts carbonic acid, and
the soda is liberated, and this has defeated my expectations more
than once. Again, though I consider it desirable to defer the
application of it until vegetation has fairly started in the
spring, yet, in one instance, I delayed the application of it so
long, that there was not moisture to dissolve it until the end of
June, and then the wheat began to shoot afresh from the roots and
the crop was seriously injured by it: but this was in an
exceedingly dry spring, and might not happen again for many years.",18298,1700s
"Nor is it possible to
conceive a practicable scheme of morals which should not rest upon such
a synthesis of the two elements as the Christian scheme presents; nor
any other mode of fulfilling that demand than, such a one as is there
first brought forward, viz., a double or Janus nature, which stands in
an equivocal relation,--to the divine nature by his actual perfections,
to the human nature by his participation in the same animal frailties
and capacities of fleshly temptation. No other vinculum could bind the
two postulates together, of an absolute perfection in the end proposed,
and yet of utter imperfection in the means for attaining it. Such was the outline of this famous tribute by an unbelieving
philosopher to the merits of Christianity as a scheme of moral
discipline. Now, it must be remembered that Marcus Aurelius was by
profession a Stoic; and that generally, as a theoretical philosopher,
but still more as a Stoic philosopher, he might be supposed incapable of
descending from these airy altitudes of speculation to the true needs,
infirmities, and capacities of human nature. Yet strange it is, that he,
of all the good emperors, was the most thoroughly human and practical.",6672,1700s

the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking

the liberty to digress a little, and tell the Reader something which I
do not doubt he has apprehended himself long ago, if he be not the
dullest Reader in the World; yet only for orders sake, let me tell him
I say, That a young Gentleman (Cousin to the aforesaid Don Fabritio)
happened one night to have some words at a Gameing House with one
Lorenzo, which created a Quarrel of fatal Consequence to the former,
who was killed upon the Spot, and likely to be so to the latter, who
was very desperately wounded. Fabritio being much concerned for his Kinsman, vow’d revenge (according
to the ancient and laudable custom of Italy) upon Lorenzo if he
surviv’d, or in case of his death (if it should happen to anticipate
that, much more swinging Death which he had in store for him) upon his
next of Kin, and so to descend Lineally like an English Estate, to all
the Heirs Males of this Family. This same Fabritio had indeed (as
Leonora told Hippolito) taken particular notice of him from his first
entrance into the Room, and was so far doubtful as to go out
immediately himself, and make enquiry concerning Lorenzo, but was
quickly inform’d of the greatness of his Error, in believing a Man to
be abroad, who was so ill of his Wounds, that they now despair’d of his
recovery; and thereupon return’d to the Ball very well satisfied, but
not before Leonora and Hippolito were departed. So, Reader, having now discharg’d my Conscience of a small Discovery
which I thought my self obliged to make to Thee, I proceed to tell
thee, that our Friend Aurelian had by this time danced himself into a
Net which he neither could, nor which is worse desired to untangle. His Soul was charm’d to the movement of her Body: an Air so graceful,
so sweet, so easie and so great, he had never seen.",2363,1600s

When one first contemplates a voyage of many thousand miles, attended
with long absence, loss of old associates, together with all the charms

possessed, but always sorely missed when no longer within call; one is
yet, and this through no lack of sensibility, apt to regard the
sacrifice about to be made to duty as sufficiently light, and, with the
aid of manhood and a little philosophy, easy of endurance. The very
task, which a resolution of this grave nature necessarily imposes, of
making as little of the matter as possible to those dear ones who yield
up their fears, and subdue their strong affections, in obedience to your
judgment, serves for a time the double purpose of hoodwinking oneself as
well as blinding those on whom we seek to practise this kind imposition. Next comes the bustle of getting ready, assisted and cheered by the
redoubled attentions of all who love, or feel an interest in one's
fortunes. Amidst the excitement, then, of these various feelings, the

OF LIBERTY. THE liberty of a people consists in being governed by laws which they
have made themselves, under whatsoever form it be of government; the
liberty of a private man in being master of his own time and actions, as
far as may consist with the laws of God and of his country. Of this
latter only we are here to discourse, and to inquire what estate of life
does best suit us in the possession of it. This liberty of our own
actions is such a fundamental privilege of human nature, that God
Himself, notwithstanding all His infinite power and right over us,
permits us to enjoy it, and that, too, after a forfeiture made by the
rebellion of Adam.",3549,1600s
"The identity of the symbols used by the early people of Ireland who were
sun worshippers, and those employed in that country for ages after

a subject for much comment. After describing the peculiar form of the

the windows which were to admit the sun's rays, Smedley says: ""It
is possible, in an age of allegory and figures, this combination and
variety expressed some sacred meaning with which we are unacquainted at
present."" The similarity observed in the sacred festivals and religious seasons
of the ancient inhabitants of Ireland and those of the early Christians,
the extent to which large stone crosses, lighted candles, the yule log
and the various other symbols belonging to fertility, or sun worship,
were retained by Christianity, furnish strong evidence of the fact that
the latter system is but part and parcel of the former. CHAPTER XVI. STONES OR COLUMNS AS THE DEITY.",639,1800s

Letter Ninth To Anne Boleyn


There came to me suddenly in the night the most afflicting news that could
have arrived. The first, to hear of the sickness of my mistress, whom I
esteem more than all the world, and whose health I desire as I do my own,
so that I would gladly bear half your illness to make you well. The
second, from the fear that I have of being still longer harassed by my
enemy, Absence, much longer, who has hitherto given me all possible
uneasiness, and as far as I can judge is determined to spite me more
because I pray God to rid me of this troublesome tormentor. The third,
because the physician in whom I have most confidence, is absent at the
very time when he might do me the greatest pleasure; for I should hope, by
him and his means, to obtain one of my chief joys on earth--that is the
care of my mistress--yet for want of him I send you my second, and hope
that he will soon make you well. I shall then love him more than ever.",32155,1400s

general, under positive instructions to abstain from all aggressive acts
towards Mexico or Mexican citizens, and to regard the relations between
that Republic and the United States as peaceful, unless she should
declare war, or commit acts of hostility indicative of a state of war. He was specially directed to protect private property, and respect
personal rights."" In his annual message of December 8, 1846, the President states that
Texas, as ceded to the United States by France in 1803, has been always
claimed as extending west to the Rio Grande; that this fact is
established by declarations of our Government during Mr. Jefferson's and
Mr. Monroe's administrations; and that the Texas which was ceded to
Spain by the Florida treaty of 1819, embraced all the country now
claimed by the State of Texas between the Nueces and the Rio Grande. He then repeats the Acts of Texas with reference to their boundaries;
stating that ""during a period of more than nine years, which intervened
between the adoption of her constitution and her annexation as one of
the States of our Union, Texas asserted and exercised many acts of
sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants west of
the Nueces; such as organizing and defining limits of counties extending
to the Rio Grande; establishing courts of justice, and extending her
judicial system over the territory; establishing also a custom-house,
post-offices, a land-office, &c.""

Louisiana by France to the United States; and he again calls the

am, I should be able, without the least fatigue, to study the most

be so in some measure, that at this age I enjoy, at once, two lives;
one terrestrial, which I possess in fact; the other celestial, which
I possess in thought; and this thought is equal to actual enjoyment,
when founded upon things we are sure to attain, as I ams sure to
attain that celestial life, through the infinite goodness and mercy
of God. Thus, I enjoy this terrestrial life, in consequence of my
sobriety and temperance, virtues so agreeable to the Deity; and I
enjoy, by the grace of the same Divine Majesty, the celestial, which

be of the utmost certainty. And I hold that dying, in the manner I
expect, is not really death, but a passage of the soul from this
earthly life to a celestial, immortal, and infinitely perfect
existence. Neither can it be otherwise: and this thought is so

"All these
enterprises were effected by the advice of the Guelphs, who were much
more powerful than the Ghibellines, for the latter were hated by the
people as well on account of their haughty bearing while in power,
during the time of Frederick, as because the church party was in more
favor than that of the emperor; for with the aid of the church they
hoped to preserve their liberty, but, with the emperor, they were
apprehensive of losing it. The Ghibellines, in the meantime, finding themselves divested of
authority, could not rest, but watched for an occasion of repossessing
the government; and they thought the favorable moment come, when they
found that Manfred, son of Frederick, had made himself sovereign of
Naples, and reduced the power of the church. They, therefore, secretly
communicated with him, to resume the management of the state, but
could not prevent their proceedings from coming to the knowledge of the
Anziani, who immediately summoned the Uberti to appear before them; but
instead of obeying, they took arms and fortified themselves in their
houses. The people, enraged at this, armed themselves, and with the
assistance of the Guelphs, compelled them to quit the city, and,
with the whole Ghibelline party, withdraw to Sienna. They then asked
assistance of Manfred king of Naples, and by the able conduct of
Farinata degli Uberti, the Guelphs were routed by the king's forces
upon the river Arbia, with so great slaughter, that those who escaped,
thinking Florence lost, did not return thither, but sought refuge at

most difficult to provide against, and, if not provided against, it
will be the most likely to obstruct any design of this nature. So true
it is, that where ignorance or ill manners once take place in a
seminary, they are sure to be handed down in a succession of illiterate
or worthless men. But this apprehension, which seems so well grounded, that a college in
any part of America would either lie unprovided, or be worse provided
than their churches are, hath no place in Bermuda; there being at this
time several gentlemen in all respects very well qualified, and in
possession of good preferments, and fair prospects at home, who having
seriously considered the great benefit that may arise to the church and
to mankind from such an undertaking, are ready to engage in it, and to
dedicate the remainder of their lives to the instructing the youth of
America, and prosecuting their own studies upon a very moderate
subsistence in a retirement, so sweet, and so secure, and every way so
well fitted for a place of education, and study, as Bermuda.",31848,1600s

"With its assault the
frost collapses, becoming bright beads on grass tip and leaf joint by
which a beetle might refresh itself. Spring is best perceived ant-level, at its ground beginnings, where the
bright yellow-green tips of new grass shoots reclaim the winter-blighted
land. I look closely at a drag line of spider silk; a necklace of
dewdrops slides down, collects to a moment’s greatness, in which I
briefly see a curved horizon, the morning sunburst, and myself, before
it falls away. Getting up from my prone position, my belly damp from the prairie earth,
I startle a whitetail jackrabbit; bounding high, it zigzags off. The
commotion disturbs a distant badger, which faces about from its diggings
to confront danger in whatever form it might take.",55150,1900s
"don’t be so slow, and, Tattine, hurry Philip up with that ice,”
 but Philip was seen at that moment bringing a large piece of ice in a
wheelbarrow, so Tattine was saved that journey, and devoted the time
instead to spreading out one of the pieces of wrapping-paper, to keep
the ice from the ground, because of the dead leaves and “things” that
were likely to cling to it. “Now break off a good-sized piece, Tattine,” Rudolph directed, “and put
it on a piece of paper near the fire,” but Tattine knew that was the
next thing to do, so what was the use of Rudolph’s telling her? It
happens quite frequently that people who are giving directions give too
many by far. “Now, Mabel,” continued the drum-major, “will you please bring some
more wood, and will you please put your mind on it and keep bringing
it? These little twigs that make the best fire burn out in a twinkling,
please notice,” but Mabel did not hurry so very much for the next
armful; since she could see for herself there was no great need for
haste.",1816,1800s

"In the diplomatic discussions at Rio de Janeiro of these wrongs
sustained by citizens of the United States and of others which seemed
as if emanating immediately from that Government itself the charge
d'affaires of the United States, under an impression that his
representations in behalf of the rights and interests of his country-
men were totally disregarded and useless, deemed it his duty, without
waiting for instructions, to terminate his official functions, to
demand his pass-ports, and return to the United States. This movement,
dictated by an honest zeal for the honor and interests of his country--
motives which operated exclusively on the mind of the officer who
resorted to it--has not been disapproved by me. The Brazilian Government, however, complained of it as a measure for
which no adequate intentional cause had been given by them, and upon an
explicit assurance through their charge d'affaires residing here that a
successor to the late representative of the United States near that
Government, the appointment of whom they desired, should be received
and treated with the respect due to his character, and that indemnity
should be promptly made for all injuries inflicted on citizens of the
United States or their property contrary to the laws of nations, a
temporary commission as charge d'affaires to that country has been
issued, which it is hopes will entirely restore the ordinary diplomatic
intercourse between the two Governments and the friendly relations
between their respective nations. Turning from the momentous concerns of our Union in its intercourse
with foreign nations to those of the deepest interest in the
administration of our internal affairs, we find the revenues of the
present year corresponding as nearly as might be expected with the
anticipations of the last, and presenting an aspect still more
favorable in the promise of the next. The balance in the Treasury on January 1st, 1827 was $6,358,686.18.",5015,1700s

"For the Gospel must be preached in all
nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world. The
palm-bearing multitude, which come out of this great tribulation, cannot be
innumerable out of all nations, unless they be made so by the preaching of
the Gospel before it comes. There must be a stone cut out of a mountain
without hands, before it can fall upon the toes of the Image, and become a
great mountain and fill the earth. An Angel must fly thro' the midst of
heaven with the everlasting Gospel to preach to all nations, before
_Babylon_ falls, and the Son of man reaps his harvest. The two Prophets
must ascend up to heaven in a cloud, before the kingdoms of this world
become the kingdoms of _Christ_.",16878,1600s

"I confess
I saw in you charms which I never found in any other; the delight I took
in my chains would have made me prefer them to sceptres, had they been
offered to me. Yes, my love for you was certainly very great; my life
was centred in you; I will even own that, though I am insulted, I shall
still perhaps have difficulty enough to free myself. Maybe,
notwithstanding the cure I am attempting, my heart may for a long time
smart with this wound. Freed from a yoke which I was happy to bend
under, I shall take a resolution never to love again. But no matter,
since your hatred repulses a heart which love brings back to you, this
is the last time you shall ever be troubled by the man you so much
despise.",6564,1600s

"For first there is a strong bond
of affection between us and our parents; yet how easily dissolved! We betake ourselves to a woman, forgetting our mother in a wife, and
the womb that bare us in that which shall bear our image. This woman
blessing us with children, our affection leaves the level it held
before, and sinks from our bed unto our issue and picture of posterity:
where affection holds no steady mansion; they growing up in years,
desire our ends; or, applying themselves to a woman, take a lawful way
to love another better than ourselves. Thus I perceive a man may be
buried alive, and behold his grave in his own issue. _Sect._ 15.--I conclude therefore, and say, there is no happiness under

As she asked the question Billy turned and looked squarely into
Arkwright's face. She saw, therefore, the great change that came to it,
as her meaning became clear to him. Her first feeling was one of
shocked realization that Arkwright had, indeed, been really blind. Her
second--she turned away her eyes hurriedly from what she thought she saw
in the man's countenance. With an assumedly gay little cry she sprang to her feet.",361,1800s
"If we knew how to use
our boys, Martin would have been seized upon and educated as a natural
philosopher. He had a passion for birds, beasts, and insects, and knew
more of them and their habits than any one in Rugby--except perhaps the
Doctor, who knew everything. He was also an experimental chemist on a
small scale, and had made unto himself an electric machine, from which
it was his greatest pleasure and glory to administer small shocks to any
small boys who were rash enough to venture into his study. And this
was by no means an adventure free from excitement; for besides the
probability of a snake dropping on to your head or twining lovingly up
your leg, or a rat getting into your breeches-pocket in search of food,
there was the animal and chemical odour to be faced, which always hung
about the den, and the chance of being blown up in some of the many
experiments which Martin was always trying, with the most wondrous
results in the shape of explosions and smells that mortal boy ever heard
of. Of course, poor Martin, in consequence of his pursuits, had become
an Ishmaelite in the house.",1480,1800s
"The
grandees were crowded around with the most considerable people: the rest
filled all the chapel so that there was no stirring. Amidst the amusement supplied to us by the poor Cardinal, I remarked
extreme satisfaction in the King and Queen at seeing this grand marriage
accomplished. The ceremony finished, as it was not long, only the King,
the Queen, and, when necessary, the Prince and Princess kneeling, their
Catholic Majesties rose and withdrew towards the left corner of their
footcloth, talked together for a short time, after which the Queen
remained where she was, and the King advanced to me, I being where I had
been during all the ceremony. The King did me the honour to say to me, ""Monsieur, in every respect I am
so pleased with you, and particularly for the manner in which you have
acquitted yourself of your embassy, that I wish to give you some marks of
my esteem, of my satisfaction; of my friendship. I make you Grandee of
Spain of the first class; you, and, at the same time, whichever of your
sons you may wish to have the same distinction; and your eldest son I
will make chevalier of the Toison d'Or.""",3873,1600s

"Our
troops began to land at the Bay of Cancale the 5th, without any
opposition. We have no further accounts yet, but expect some every
moment. By the plan of it, which I have seen, it is by no means a weak
place; and I fear there will be many hats to be disposed of, before it is
taken. There are in the port above thirty privateers; about sixteen of
their own, and about as many taken from us. 237

"Thus he continued
his flagitious courses from 1526 to 1533, inclusively, till there was
news brought of the Wealth and Opulence of the Region of _Perusia_,
whither the _Spaniards_ marcht, and so for some time there was a
Cessation of this Tyranny; but in a few days after they returned and
acted enormous Crimes, robbed, and imprisoned them and committed higher
offences against the God of Heaven; nor have they ye done, so that now
these Three Hundred Miles of Land so populous (as I said before) lies
now uncultivated and almost deserted. No Solifidian can believe the particular Narrations of their Barbarism,
and Cruelty in those Countreys. I will only relate two or three
Stories which are fresh in my memory. The _Spaniards_ used to trace the
steps of the _Indians_, both Men and Women with curst Currs, furious
Dogs; an _Indian_ Woman that was sick hapned to be in the way in sight,
who perceiving that she was not able to avoid being torn in pieces by
the Dogs, takes a Cord that she had and hangs her self upon a Beam,
tying her Child (which she unforunately had with her) to her foot; and
no sooner had she done, yet the Dogs were at her, tearing the Child,
but a Priest coming that way Baptiz'd it before quite dead. When the _Spaniards_ left this Kingdom, one of them invited the Son of
some _Indian_ Governour of a City or Province, to go along with him,
who told him he would not leave or desert his Native Countrey,
whereupon he threatned to cut off his ears, if he refus'd to follow
him: But the Youth persisting resolutely, that he would continue in the
place of his Nativity, he drawing his Sword cut off each Ear,
notwithstanding which he persever'd in his first opinion, and then as
if he had only pincht him, smilingly cut off his Nose and Lips.",20321,1400s

"These words produced no effect upon
Luca, whose mind was now quite made up; he had been induced to desert
his party by new conditions and promises of alliance from Piero; for one
of his nieces had been married to Giovanni Tornabuoni. He, therefore,
advised Niccolo to dismiss his followers and return home, telling him
he ought to be satisfied, if the city were governed by the magistrates,
which would certainly be the case, and that all ought to lay aside their
weapons; for the Signory, most of whom were friendly, would decide their
differences. Niccolo, finding him impracticable, returned home; but
before he left, he said, ""I can do the city no good alone, but I can
easily foresee the evils that will befall her. This resolution of yours
will rob our country of her liberty; you will lose the government, I
shall lose my property, and the rest will be exiled."" During this disturbance the Signory closed the palace and kept their
magistrates about them, without showing favor to either party.",2464,1400s
"The voters of Illinois were quick to realize the sacrifice he had made. The five stubborn men became his most devoted personal followers; and
his action at this time did much to bring about a great political change
in the State. All over the country old party lines were beginning to
break up and re-form themselves on this one question of slavery. Keeping
its old name, the Democratic party became the party in favor of slavery,
while the Northern Whigs and all those Democrats who objected to slavery
joined in what became known as the Republican party. It was at a great
mass convention held in Bloomington in May, 1856, that the Republican
party of Illinois took final shape; and it was here that Lincoln made
the wonderful address which has become famous in party history as his
""lost speech.""",1815,1800s

"_Young men._--If we may not be tedious, we would request to know one
thing more. It is commonly said that those of the Separation hold none
to be true churches but their own, and condemn all the churches in the
world besides; which lieth as a foul blot upon them, yea even on some
here in New England, except they can remove it. _Ancient men._--It is a manifest slander laid upon them; for they hold
all the Reformed Churches to be true churches, and even the most rigid
of them have ever done so, as appears by their Apologies and other
writings; and we ourselves some of us know of much intercommunion
that divers have held with them reciprocally, not only with the Dutch
and French, but even with the Scotch, who are not of the best mould,
yea and with the Lutherans also; and we believe they have gone as far
herein, both in judgment and practice, as any of the churches in New
England do or can do, to deal faithfully and bear witness against their
corruptions. Having thus far satisfied all your demands, we shall here break off

AGAINST EVIL COMPANY. Why should I join with those in play

      Who curse and swear, but never pray;
        Who call ill names, and fight? I hate to hear a wanton song:

"But, then, both
they, and all others, are forbid to eat a greater quantity of any
kind of food, even of that which agrees with them, than what their
stomachs can easily digest; the same is to be understood of drink. Hence it is that those, with whom nothing disagrees, are not
bound to observe any rule but that relating to the quantity, and
not to the quality, of their food; a rule which they may, without
the least difficulty in the world, comply with. Let nobody tell me, that there are numbers, who, though they live
most irregularly, live in health and spirits, to those remote
periods of life, attained by the most sober; for, this argument
being grounded on a case full of uncertainty and hazard, and
which, besides, so seldom occurs, as to look more like a miracle
than the work of nature, men should not suffer themselves to be
thereby persuaded to live irregularly, nature having been too
liberal to those, who did so without suffering by it; a favour,
which very few have any right to expect. Whoever, trusting to
his youth, or the strength of his constitution, or the goodness of
his stomach, slights these observations, must expect to suffer
greatly by so doing, and live in constant danger of disease and
death. I therefore affirm, that an old man, even of a bad
constitution, who leads a regular and sober life, is surer of a
long one, than a young man of the best constitution, who leads a
disorderly life.",30660,1400s

caring to stay without sufficient cause, he departed on Saturday the 26th
of April, and went to the island of Tortuga 6 leagues to the westwards. He
lay here all that night in a calm with all his sails loose, the tide
running back against the current. Next day the N.W. wind and a strong
current setting to the west obliged him to go back to anchor in the river
Guadalquiver in the same island, to wait for a wind sufficient to stem the
current, which both then and the year before he found to run strong from
the east. On Tuesday the 29th of April, the wind became fair and he was
able to reach Cape St Nicholas, whence he crossed over to Cuba and run
along its southern coast a league beyond Cape Fuerte, where he put into a
large bay which he named _Puerto Grande_ or the Great Harbour.",12325,1700s
"Our hero would not cloud with sorrow the festivity
attending the wedding of two persons to whom he was so highly
obliged. He therefore exerted himself, danced, sung, played at the
various games of the day, and was the blithest of the company. The
next morning, however, he had more serious matters to think of. The clergyman who had married the young couple was so much pleased
with the supposed student of divinity, that he came next day from
Penrith on purpose to pay him a visit. This might have been a
puzzling chapter had he entered into any examination of our hero's
supposed theological studies; but fortunately he loved better to
hear and communicate the news of the day.",4965,1700s
"Persons lightly dipt, not grained, in generous honesty are but pale in
goodness and faint-hued in sincerity. But be thou what thou virtuously
art, and let not the ocean wash away thy tincture. Stand majestically
upon that axis where prudent simplicity hath fixed thee; and at no
temptation invert the poles of thy honesty that vice may be uneasy and
even monstrous unto thee; let iterated good acts and long confirmed
habits make virtue natural or a second nature in thee; and since few or
none prove eminently virtuous but from some advantageous foundations
in their temper and natural inclinations, study thyself betimes, and
early find what nature bids thee to be or tells thee what thou mayest
be. They who thus timely descend into themselves, cultivating the good
seeds which nature hath set in them, and improving their prevalent
inclinations to perfection, become not shrubs but cedars in their
generation. And to be in the form of the best of bad, or the worst of
the good, will be no satisfaction unto them.",586,1600s
"St. Pouange was not naturally wicked. The torrent of business and
amusements had hurried away his soul, which was not yet acquainted with
itself. He did not border upon that grey age which usually hardens the
hearts of ministers. He listened to Gordon with a downcast look, and
some tears escaped him, which he was surprised to shed. In a word, he
repented.",35595,1600s

liberty and urged that circumcision was necessary for justification, he
resisted them, and would not allow Titus to be circumcised. For, as he
would not offend or contemn any one's weakness in faith, but yielded
for the time to their will, so, again, he would not have the liberty of
faith offended or contemned by hardened self-justifiers, but walked in
a middle path, sparing the weak for the time, and always resisting the
hardened, that he might convert all to the liberty of faith. On the same
principle we ought to act, receiving those that are weak in the faith,
but boldly resisting these hardened teachers of works, of whom we shall
hereafter speak at more length. Christ also, when His disciples were asked for the tribute money, asked
of Peter whether the children of a king were not free from taxes. Peter
agreed to this; yet Jesus commanded him to go to the sea, saying, ""Lest
we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up
the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth thou
shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for Me and

that it necessarily teaches you to present yourself, to sit, stand, and

Essay:
Quality in Life


QUALITY IN LIFE



Another aspect concerning religion and death which never ceases to
amaze me is the devout Christian who believes that one should strive
for every possible breath 'til the end, as if life for life's sake is
of foremost importance. To me, this is saying that heaven is not as
great as proclaimed; if their faith, indeed, is so steadfast and
secure, would not the proposition of the imminence of heaven produce
more smiles than that of another painful breath of life? I feel that life must contain an element of quality to be worth the
actual existence. To me this would mean wrapping myself in thought,
and perhaps, subsequently unleashing my hoard of mind-words onto paper,
where they would then remain for later perusal. My thoughts and sense
of self are more precious than any physical activity I might pursue, or
monetary affluence I might acquire.",37060,1900s

"But
the Roman Pontiffs have prudently judged that leniency is to be observed
in this obligation, and therefore we read that many times they have
dispensed from vows. The case of the King of Aragon who was called back
from the monastery is well known, and there are also examples in our own
times. [Now, if dispensations have been granted for the sake of securing
temporal interests, it is much more proper that they be granted on
account of the distress of souls.] In the second place, why do our adversaries exaggerate the obligation or
effect of a vow when, at the same time, they have not a word to say of
the nature of the vow itself, that it ought to be in a thing possible,
that it ought to be free, and chosen spontaneously and deliberately? But
it is not unknown to what extent perpetual chastity is in the power

persecutions of the Catholics in Ireland have been long, incessant, and

arisen in despite of persecution, and increased by means of it, and
these, with hundreds or thousands of other instances (for history
abounds with them), prove that persecution or punishment does not, and
cannot, effect the object in view; and that, consequently, punishment
cannot be justified by its only legitimate principle of
justification--utility. It is madness to punish for an offence which
must be increased by the very nature of the punishment. Formerly, in
punishments for blasphemy, men, women, and children were burnt and put
to every variety of torture, for the good of their souls--now, we
substitute for the word soul, the phrase--’_the security of society_,’
or other jargon equally nonsensical. The Court of Inquisition was, and

our friend valued this acquisition, but entirely because it was situated
in his own parish, and part of the lands marching with the Glebe. The previous owner of Moneypennies had built an elegant house on the
estate, to which Mrs. Pringle is at present actively preparing to remove
from the manse; and it is understood, that, as Mr. Snodgrass was last
week declared helper, and successor to the Doctor, his marriage with Miss
Isabella Tod will take place with all convenient expedition. There is

certain whether he shall succeed in finding a place in the heart and
affections of her whom he loves. The last letter (18), which makes mention of the illness of the legate as
the cause of the delay in the affair of the divorce, shows that this
correspondence ended in May, 1529, at which time the court of legates was
open for the final decision of that point. Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, subsequently created Earl of
Wiltshire, after passing many years at the court of Claude, queen of
Francis I of France, returned to England about the end of the year 1525,
at the age of eighteen. Here she was soon appointed maid of honour to
Queen Katherine, and attracted the particular attentions of Henry VIII,
who was then engaged in soliciting a divorce from the Pope. The marked
preference shown by the king for Anne Boleyn raised so much jealousy and
slander that it was thought advisable by her family to remove the new
favourite from the court; and it was during this retirement at Hever, a
seat of her father's in Kent, that these letters were addressed to her by
her royal lover.",32155,1400s

the soul made by it, just as iron exposed to fire glows like fire, on
account of its union with the fire. It is clear then that to a Christian
man his faith suffices for everything, and that he has no need of works
for justification. But if he has no need of works, neither has he need

"In this engagement, greater valor was exhibited on both sides than
had been shown in any other during the last fifty years, upward of a
thousand dead being left upon the field. The troops of the church were
at length victorious, for her numerous infantry so annoyed the ducal
cavalry, that they were compelled to retreat, and Alfonso himself would
have fallen into the hands of the enemy, had he not been rescued by a
body of Turks, who remained at Otranto, and were at that time in his
service. The lord of Rimino, after this victory, returned triumphantly
to Rome, but did not long enjoy the fruit of his valor; for having,
during the heat of the engagement, taken a copious draught of water,
he was seized with a flux, of which he very shortly afterward died. The
pope caused his funeral to be conducted with great pomp, and in a few
days, sent the Count Girolamo toward Citta di Castello to restore it
to Lorenzo, and also endeavor to gain Rimino, which being by Roberto's
death left to the care of his widow and a son who was quite a boy, his
holiness thought might be easily won; and this certainly would have
been the case, if the lady had not been defended by the Florentines,
who opposed him so effectually, as to prevent his success against both
Castello and Rimino. While these things were in progress at Rome and in Romagna, the
Venetians took possession of Figaruolo and crossed the Po with their
forces.",2464,1400s

"That boastful
Thraso, foaming and gnashing his teeth, proclaimed that he would dare
all things for the glory of God and for the honour of the holy apostolic
seat; and, being puffed up respecting your power, which he was about
to misuse, he looked forward with all certainty to victory; seeking to
promote, not so much the primacy of Peter, as his own pre-eminence among
the theologians of this age; for he thought it would contribute in no
slight degree to this, if he were to lead Luther in triumph. The result
having proved unfortunate for the sophist, an incredible rage torments
him; for he feels that whatever discredit to Rome has arisen through me
has been caused by the fault of himself alone. Suffer me, I pray you, most excellent Leo, both to plead my own cause,
and to accuse your true enemies. I believe it is known to you in what
way Cardinal Cajetan, your imprudent and unfortunate, nay unfaithful,
legate, acted towards me. When, on account of my reverence for your
name, I had placed myself and all that was mine in his hands, he did not
so act as to establish peace, which he could easily have established by
one little word, since I at that time promised to be silent and to make
an end of my case, if he would command my adversaries to do the same.",1911,1400s

"If they have spare
time at their disposal, by all means let them spend it in prayer; nor
must they lay upon themselves unnecessary burdens, and call them
obligations. When the taste for meditation is very great, the soul does
not usually fall into these last-named errors, but rather into the
former one, that of courting retirement. I knew a person who spent more
time in prayer when it was painful to her than when she felt it a
delight, struggling with the disinclination; but this is injurious to
the health, because of the violence which it does to the senses and the
understanding, which being unable to concentrate themselves upon any one
object, and being deprived of the sweet communion which formerly held
them in subjection to God, endure such torment, that the subject of it
would rather suffer the greatest trial than the violence which is
necessary to enable it to fix its thoughts on God. The person to whom I
alluded sometimes passed two or three hours successively in this painful
devotion, and she has assured me that the strangest austerities would
have been delightful to her in comparison with the time thus spent. But
as a violence so strong as this in subjects so weak is calculated to
ruin both body and mind, I think it is better not in any way to
regulate the time spent in prayer by our varying emotions.",25133,1600s
"While his sympathy
with mankind taught him the nature of their wants, his reason suggested
to what extent these were capable of relief, as well as the best mode of
effecting it. He did not waste his strength on illusory schemes of
benevolence, like Las Casas, on the one hand; nor did he countenance
the selfish policy of the colonists, on the other. He aimed at the
practicable,--the greatest good practicable. In accomplishing his objects, he disclaimed force equally with fraud. He
trusted for success to his power over the convictions of his hearers; and
the source of this power was the confidence he inspired in his own
integrity.",1209,1700s

follows:

          Vivente: at certa est non potuisse mori. Taddeo's method of designing was very broad and bold, as may be seen

it to its ancient form, and with so great reputation of justice and

"The army being thus reduced, without a leader, and disorder prevailing
in every department, the duke of Calabria, who was with his forces near
Sienna, resolved to attack them immediately. The Florentines, finding
the enemy at hand, were seized with a sudden panic; neither their arms,
nor their numbers, in which they were superior to their adversaries,
nor their position, which was one of great strength, could give them
confidence; but observing the dust occasioned by the enemy's approach,
without waiting for a sight of them, they fled in all directions,
leaving their ammunition, carriages, and artillery to be taken by the
foe. Such cowardice and disorder prevailed in the armies of those times,
that the turning of a horse's head or tail was sufficient to decide the
fate of an expedition. This defeat loaded the king's troops with booty,
and filled the Florentines with dismay; for the city, besides the war,
was afflicted with pestilence, which prevailed so extensively, that all
who possessed villas fled to them to escape death. This occasioned the
defeat to be attended with greater horror; for those citizens whose
possessions lay in the Val di Pesa and the Val d'Elsa, having retired to
them, hastened to Florence with all speed as soon as they heard of the
disaster, taking with them not only their children and their property,

"They had gone ashore in the early summer
twilight and had very promptly put themselves to bed; thanks to which
circumstance and to their having, during the previous hours, in their
commodious cabin, slept the sleep of youth and health, they began to
feel, toward eleven o’clock, very alert and inquisitive. They looked out
of their windows across a row of small green fields, bordered with
low stone walls of rude construction, and saw a deep blue ocean lying
beneath a deep blue sky, and flecked now and then with scintillating
patches of foam. A strong, fresh breeze came in through the curtainless
casements and prompted our young men to observe, generally, that it
didn’t seem half a bad climate. They made other observations after they
had emerged from their rooms in pursuit of breakfast--a meal of which
they partook in a huge bare hall, where a hundred Negroes, in white
jackets, were shuffling about upon an uncarpeted floor; where the
flies were superabundant, and the tables and dishes covered over with a
strange, voluminous integument of coarse blue gauze; and where several
little boys and girls, who had risen late, were seated in fastidious

holding the letter upside down before her eyes, Lady Jane, with kind
politeness, passed on to the picture at which her young friend had been
at work, and stooping to examine the miniature with her glass, made some
observations on the painting, and gave Caroline time to recover. Nor

the baby-song. No enmity of outward circumstances, therefore, but his
own nature, was responsible for Shelley's doom. A being with so much about it of child-like unreasonableness, and yet
withal so much of the beautiful attraction luminous in a child's sweet
unreasonableness, would seem fore-fated by its very essence to the
transience of the bubble and the rainbow, of all things filmy and fair. Did some shadow of this destiny bear part in his sadness?",1336,1800s

"Now he that knows that he has a Father gracious to him through Christ,
truly knows God; he knows also that God cares for him, and calls upon
God; in a word, he is not without God, as the heathen. For devils and
the ungodly are not able to believe this Article: the forgiveness of
sins. Hence, they hate God as an enemy, call not upon Him, and expect no
good from Him. Augustine also admonishes his readers concerning the word
""faith,"" and teaches that the term ""faith"" is accepted in the Scriptures
not for knowledge such as is in the ungodly but for confidence which
consoles and encourages the terrified mind. Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to do good
works, not that we should trust to merit grace by them, but because
it is the will of God.",275,1400s
"All the Heads which I examined had their compleat number of Teeth, four
cutt before, and ten Grinders on each side, but they appeared not in the
least worn nor stained, as the Teeth of other Rabbets are by Mastication. The Nails of the Paws were most of them exceedingly sharp. The Skins were all produced, being dress’d in Allum; they were of several
Colours, as to their Furr, which was considerably long, and in one
particularly (which was the fifth Rabbet,) that part which cover’d the
Head was curled. The Rabbet which I extracted weigh’d one and twenty ounces _Averdupoize_,
making an allowance for one of the Paws not yet come away, and part of
the _Viscera_ that were lost. From all these Considerations I was fully convinced, that at the same
time that the external Appearance of these Animals was exactly like
such Creatures, as must inevitably undergo the Changes that happen to
adult Animals, by Food and Air, they carry’d within them the strongest
Marks of _Fœtus’s_, even by such parts as cannot exist in an Adult, and
without which a _Fœtus_ cannot possibly be supposed to live.",62720,1600s

"But, considered as the verses of a
lover, no man that has ever loved will much commend them. They are
neither courtly nor pathetic, have neither gallantry nor fondness. His
praises are too far sought, and too hyperbolical, either to express love,
or to excite it; every stanza is crowded with darts and flames, with
wounds and death, with mingled souls and with broken hearts. The principal artifice by which “The Mistress” is filled with conceits is
very copiously displayed by Addison. Love is by Cowley, as by other
poets, expressed metaphorically by flame and fire; and that which is true
of real fire is said of love, or figurative fire, the same word in the
same sentence retaining both significations.",5098,1700s
"We could not visit, our two masters being at war; but the first time I
met him at a third place, I got somebody to present me to him; and I told
him, that though we were to be national enemies, I flattered myself we
might be, however, personal friends, with a good deal more of the same
kind; which he returned in full as polite a manner. Two days afterward, I
went, early in the morning, to solicit the Deputies of Amsterdam, where I
found l'Abbe de la Ville, who had been beforehand with me; upon which I
addressed myself to the Deputies, and said, smilingly, I am very sorry,
Gentlemen, to find my enemy with you; my knowledge of his capacity is
already sufficient to make me fear him; we are not upon equal terms; but
I trust to your own interest against his talents. If I have not this day
had the first word, I shall at least have the last. They smiled: the Abbe
was pleased with the compliment, and the manner of it, stayed about a
quarter of an hour, and then left me to my Deputies, with whom I
continued upon the same tone, though in a very serious manner, and told
them that I was only come to state their own true interests to them,
plainly and simply, without any of those arts, which it was very
necessary for my friend to make use of to deceive them. I carried my
point, and continued my 'procede' with the Abbe; and by this easy and
polite commerce with him, at third places, I often found means to fish
out from him whereabouts he was.",3356,1600s

    of the prospect, as if I had never beheld it before. It was, indeed,
    infinitely more beautiful at present, than it had been eight months
    ago, owing to the difference of the season. The forests on the
    mountains were all clad in fresh foliage, and glowed in many
    variegated hues; and even the lower hills were not entirely destitute
    of pleasing spots, and covered with herbage. But the plains, above
    all, shone forth in the greatest luxuriance of colours, the brightest
    tints of verdure being profusely lavished upon their fertile groves;

fearful to go from light to darkness, from all that we have ever known

thus stingless, is yet full of horror, what is he with his worst sting
beside, the sting of our sins? What is he when he is taking us, not to
nothingness, but to judgment? He is indeed so fearful then, that no
words can paint him half so truly as our foreboding dread of him, and no
arguments which the wit of man can furnish can strip him of his terrors. But what if death too, as well as life, be ours?--which he is, if we are
Christ's; for Christ has conquered him.",13151,1700s

wise and good, calculated to help on the cause of God, and whoever
denies it, is considered as fighting against God. Thus men are led away from the divine institutions to those of human
invention. Human wisdom is exalted above divine; and all with a view

"The universal empire made him only more known and more
powerful, but could not make him more beloved. He had greater ability of
doing good, but your inclination to it is not less: and though you could
not extend your beneficence to so many persons, yet you have lost as few
days as that excellent emperor; and never had his complaint to make when
you went to bed, that the sun had shone upon you in vain, when you had
the opportunity of relieving some unhappy man. This, my lord, has justly
acquired you as many friends as there are persons who have the honour to
be known to you. Mere acquaintance you have none; you have drawn them
all into a nearer line; and they who have conversed with you are for ever
after inviolably yours. This is a truth so generally acknowledged that
it needs no proof: it is of the nature of a first principle, which is
received as soon as it is proposed; and needs not the reformation which
Descartes used to his; for we doubt not, neither can we properly say, we
think we admire and love you above all other men: there is a certainty in
the proposition, and we know it.",2615,1600s
"Gold and
silver scarcely sufficed: the shops of the dealers were emptied in a few
days; in a word luxury the most unbridled reigned over Court and city,
for the fete had a huge crowd of spectators. Things went to such a
point, that the King almost repented of what he had said, and remarked,
that he could not understand how husbands could be such fools as to ruin
themselves by dresses for their wives; he might have added, by dresses
for themselves. But the impulse had been given; there was now no time to
remedy it, and I believe the King at heart was glad; for it pleased him
during the fetes to look at all the dresses. He loved passionately all
kinds of sumptuosity at his Court; and he who should have held only to
what had been said, as to the folly of expense, would have grown little
in favour. There was no means, therefore, of being wise among so many
fools.",3861,1600s

_Indians de novo_ at his own pleasure, to the end (as it was reported)
he might violently force the _Indians_ away from such as did infest or
molest him; and dispose of them to others; upon which it fell out, that
for the space of a Year complete, there was no sowing or planting: And
when they wanted Bread, the _Spaniards_ did by force plunder the
_Indians_ of the whole stock of Corn that they had laid up for the
support of their Families, and by these indirect Courses above Thirty
Thousand perished with Hunger. Nay it fortun'd at one time, that a
Woman opprest with insufferable Hunger, depriv'd her own Son of his
Life to preserve her own. In this Province also they brought many to an untimely End, loading
their Shoulders with heavy planks and pieces of Timer, which they were
compell'd to carry to a Haven Forty Miles distant, in order to their
building of Ships; sending them likewise unto the Mountains to find out
Hony and Wax, where they were devour'd by Tygers; nay they loaded Women
impregnated with Carriage and Burthens fit for beasts. But no greater pest was there that could unpeople this Province, than
the License granted the _Spaniards_ by this Governour, to demand
Captives from the _Casics_ and Potentates of this Region; for at the
Expiration of Four or Five Months, or as often as they obtain'd leave
of the Governour to demand them, they deliver'd them up Fifty Servants,
and the _Spaniards_ terrified them with Menaces, that if they did not
obey them in answering their unreasonable Demands, they should be burnt
alive, or baited to Death by Dogs. Now the _Indians_ are but slenderly
stor'd with Servants; for it is much if a _Casic_ hath Three or Four in
his Retinue, therefore they have recourse to the Subjects; and when
they had, in the first place, seized the Orphans, they required
earnestly and instantly one Son of the Parent, who had but Two, and Two
of him that had but Three, and for the Lord of the place satisfied the

world functions only to manifest historical myths or systems of ideas. If the masses today suffer from a lack of conscious religious, social

delighted to have an opportunity of procuring it for him; if he finds

do not love them as much as I do, may not have observed, but which
all tend to develope their character. For instance, every one knows
the fondness of dogs for warmth, and that they never appear more
contented than when reposing on the rug before a good fire. If,
however, I quit the room, my dog leaves his warm berth, and places
himself at the door, where he can the better hear my footsteps, and be

one of these views; for lies are always detected sooner or later. If I
tell a malicious lie, in order to affect any man's fortune or character,
I may indeed injure him for some time; but I shall be sure to be the
greatest sufferer myself at last; for as soon as ever I am detected (and
detected I most certainly shall be), I am blasted for the infamous
attempt; and whatever is said afterward, to the disadvantage of that
person, however true, passes for calumny. If I lie, or equivocate (for it
is the same thing), in order to excuse myself for something that I have
said or done, and to avoid the danger and the shame that I apprehend from
it, I discover at once my fear as well as my falsehood; and only
increase, instead of avoiding, the danger and the shame; I show myself to
be the lowest and the meanest of mankind, and am sure to be always

"ITS INHABITANTS. As soon as we came near Cave's Island some canoes came about us and made
signs for us to come ashore, as all the rest had done before; probably
thinking we could run the ship aground anywhere, as they did their proas;
for we saw neither sail nor anchor among any of them, though most eastern
Indians have both. These had proas made of one tree, well dug, with
outlagers on one side: they were but small yet well shaped. We
endeavoured to anchor but found no ground within a mile of the shore: we
kept close along the north side, still sounding till we came to the
north-east end, but found no ground; the canoes still accompanying us;
and the bays were covered with men going along as we sailed: many of them
strove to swim off to us but we left them astern. Being at the north-east
point we found a strong current setting to the north-west; so that though
we had steered to keep under the high island, yet we were driven towards
the flat one.",15685,1600s
"If something like the Thomson view were correct then the number of
electrons, each with one unit of negative electricity, would depend on
the total size of the positive charge carried by the atom. If the charge
were +5, there would have to be 5 electrons present to balance that. The
total charge would then be 0 and the atom as a whole would be
electrically neutral. If, in such a case, an electron were removed, the atomic charge of +5
would be balanced by only 4 electrons with a total charge of -4. In that
case, the net charge of the atom as a whole would be +1.",49819,1900s
"I suggest we go back and do it now.”

Paynter, beginning to follow, hesitated a moment, and then said:
“Forgive me for a kind of liberty; as you say, you are an older friend
of the family. I entirely agree with your suggestion, but before you act
on your present suspicions, do you know, I think Miss Vane ought to be
warned a little? I rather fear all this will be a new shock to her.”

“Very well,” said Ashe, after looking at him steadily for an instant. “Let us go across to her first.”

From the opening of the wood they could see Barbara Vane writing at the
garden table, which was littered with correspondence, and the butler
with his yellow face waiting behind her chair. As the lengths of grass
lessened between them, and the little group at the table grew larger and
clearer in the sunlight, Paynter had a painful sense of being part of an
embassy of doom.",1721,1800s

blue _hensorr_ trees rose up to swallow him from view. Mason swung along

"What pleasure can an early April day afford the man who has slept in an
overheated flat and is hurrying to an office where eighty degrees is the
average all the year round? Or the pale shop-girl, who complains if a
breath of morning air strays into the suburban train where she is seated? As people who habitually use such “relishes” as Chutney and
Worcestershire are incapable of appreciating delicately prepared food, so
the ”soft” mortals who have accustomed themselves to a perpetual August
are insensible to fine shadings of temperature. The other day I went with a friend to inspect some rooms he had been
decorating in one of our public schools. The morning had been frosty,
but by eleven o’clock the sun warmed the air uncomfortably.",319,1800s

"Everyone who is conversant
with the class in which child imprisonment and compulsory schooling is
carried out to the final extremity of the university degree knows that
its scholastic culture is a sham; that it knows little about literature
or art and a great deal about point-to-point races; and that the
village cobbler, who has never read a page of Plato, and is admittedly
a dangerously ignorant man politically, is nevertheless a Socrates
compared to the classically educated gentlemen who discuss politics in
country houses at election time (and at no other time) after their day's
earnest and skilful shooting. Think of the years and years of weary
torment the women of the piano-possessing class have been forced to
spend over the keyboard, fingering scales. How many of them could be
bribed to attend a pianoforte recital by a great player, though they
will rise from sick beds rather than miss Ascot or Goodwood? Another familiar fact that teaches the same lesson is that many women
who have voluntarily attained a high degree of culture cannot add
up their own housekeeping books, though their education in simple
arithmetic was compulsory, whereas their higher education has been
wholly voluntary. Everywhere we find the same result.",908,1800s
"Thus Le Blanc, taking hold of a little casket, Cellamare
cried, ""M. le Blanc, M. le Blanc, leave that alone; that is not for you;

him, he added, ""He has been a pander all his life, and there are nothing
but women's letters there."" [Illustration: Search Of The Spanish Ambassador--Painted by Maurice Leloir--front3]


The Abbe Dubois burst out laughing, not daring to grow angry. When all was examined, the King's seal, and that of the ambassador, were
put upon all the bureaux and the caskets which contained papers. The
Abbe Dubois and Le Blanc went off together to give an account of their
proceedings to the Regent, leaving a company of musketeers to guard the

seen in the following:[122]

    succo aqueo concreverat, corpus attrahendum attingit,
    attactum attrahenti unitur; corpus peculiari effluviorum

closet of the Queen my mother, where I found the King. I expressed my
resentment at being deceived by him, and at being cajoled by his promise
to accompany me from Paris to Poitiers, which, as it now appeared, was a
mere pretence. I represented that I did not marry by my own choice, but
entirely agreeable to the advice of King Charles, the Queen my mother,
and himself; that, since they had given him to me for a husband, they
ought not to hinder me from partaking of his fortunes; that I was
resolved to go to him, and that if I had not their leave, I would get
away how I could, even at the hazard of my life. The King answered:

Covenanting days, was not actually concerned in the burning of the Bonnie

son of well-to-do parents who can afford to keep
him while he acquires his education, or he must show
so much ability at an early age as to enable him to
subsist on scholarships until he is ready to earn his
living. The former condition is, of course, a mere
matter of luck, and could not be preserved in its
present form under any kind of Socialism or Communism. This loss is emphasized by defenders of the
present system, and no doubt it would be, to same
extent, a real loss. But the well-to-do are a small
proportion of the population, and presumably on the
average no more talented by nature than their less
fortunate contemporaries. If the advantages which
are enjoyed now by those few among them who are
capable of good work in science or art could be

"PREFACE

The author of the following discourses, Lewis Cornaro, was descended
from one of the most illustrious families in Venice, but by the ill
conduct of some of his relations, had the misfortune to be deprived
of the dignity of a nobleman, and excluded from all honours and
public employments in the state. Chagrined at this unmerited
disgrace, he retired to Padua, and married a lady of the family
of Spiltemberg, whose name was Veronica. Being in possession of
a good estate, he was very desirous of having children; and after
a long expectation of this happiness, his wife was delivered of a
daughter, to whom he gave the name of Clara. This was his only
child, who afterwards was married to John, the son of Fantini
Cornaro, of a rich family in Cyprus, while that island belonged to
the republic of Venice. Though he was far advanced in life when
his daughter Clara came into the world, yet he lived to see her
very old, and the mother of eight sons and three daughters.",30660,1400s

"On this the grandees again came to Cosmo, and most humbly
begged he would assemble the people in a general council or parliament,
but this he refused, for he wished to make them sensible of their great
mistake; and when Donato Cocchi, being Gonfalonier of Justice, proposed
to assemble them without his consent, the Signors who were of Cosmo's
party ridiculed the idea so unmercifully, that the man's mind actually
became deranged, and he had to retire from office in consequence. However, since it is undesirable to allow matters to proceed beyond
recovery, the Gonfalon of Justice being in the hands of Luca Pitti,
a bold-spirited man, Cosmo determined to let him adopt what course he
thought proper, that if any trouble should arise it might be imputed
to Luca and not to himself. Luca, therefore, in the beginning of his
magistracy, several times proposed to the people the appointment of
a new balia; and, not succeeding, he threatened the members of the
councils with injurious and arrogant expressions, which were shortly
followed by corresponding conduct; for in the month of August, 1458, on
the eve of Saint Lorenzo, having filled the piazza, and compelled
them to assent to a measure to which he knew them to be averse. Having
recovered power, created a new balia, and filled the principal offices
according to the pleasure of a few individuals, in order to commence
that government with terror which they had obtained by force, they
banished Girolamo Machiavelli, with some others, and deprived many of
the honors of government. Girolamo, having transgressed the confines to
which he was limited, was declared a rebel.",2464,1400s

"We can, without Damage to ourselves,
make it their Interest to adhere to us: And when Experience has once
taught them, that their Interest lies with us, they will want no other
Inducement to engage them to us: Yea, it will not only attach those of
them to us, who are not yet gone to _Canada_, but it will induce those
who are, to return to their Brethren, for the Sake of the Profit they
might reap by it; especially if we give them all the Advantage we can,
consistent with our own. As unjust and abusive Treatment of the _Indians_ tends naturally
to alienate them from us, and to turn them off to the _French_; so
a Series of just and faithful Dealing with them would be likely to
attach them to us, and to make them our fast Friends. This again
appears from the Temper and Conduct of that Part of the _Tribe_ of the
_River Indians_ who live at _Stockbridge_. For tho’ they were, for
a considerable Time, extremely jealous, that we had some ill Design
upon them, even in the Favours they received at our Hands (a Jealousy
founded, I suppose, upon the ill Usage the _Natives_ have too often
been the Subjects of) yet by the just Treatment they, for a Course of
Years, have met with from the _Government_, from Mr. _Sergeant_, Mr.
_Woodbridge_, and others, they are become our hearty Friends; willing
to live or die with us, whether in Peace or War. It is very true, that in order to obtain the End proposed, our Trade
with the _Indians_ must not be in private Hands.",66230,1600s

"said the dwarf, stretching out first his legs and then
his arms, and then shaking his head up and down and as far round as it
would go, for five minutes without stopping, apparently with the view
of ascertaining if he were quite correctly put together, while Gluck
stood contemplating him in speechless amazement. He was dressed in a
slashed doublet of spun gold, so fine in its texture that the prismatic
colors gleamed over it as if on a surface of mother-of-pearl; and over
this brilliant doublet his hair and beard fell full halfway to the
ground in waving curls, so exquisitely delicate that Gluck could hardly
tell where they ended; they seemed to melt into air. The features of
the face, however, were by no means finished with the same delicacy;
they were rather coarse, slightly inclining to coppery in complexion,
and indicative, in expression, of a very pertinacious and intractable
disposition in their small proprietor. When the dwarf had finished his
self-examination, he turned his small, sharp eyes full on Gluck and
stared at him deliberately for a minute or two. ""No, it wouldn't,

the monarchy of Persia, by Darius the son of Hystaspes, in favour of
Artabazus, who is said, by some historians, to have been the son of one of
those Persian lords who conspired against the Magi. Pontus is a region of Asia Minor, situated partly along the coast of the
Euxine sea (_Pontus Euxinus_), from which it derives its name. It extends
from the river Halys, as far as Colchis. Several princes reigned in that

that in this way remission of sins is granted us, if we believe that

belief ought always to be in view, in order that it may be opposed to

worshipers coming and going, and heard the disdainful words from the
priests cast at the hated foreigners, he realized that he was face to
face with an awful opposing force. It was the great stone of heathenism

he had been long ago in the Canadian pasture-field? The travelers ate their dinner by the roadside under the shade of some

"Furthermore, God ordained marriage to be a help against human infirmity. The Canons themselves say that the old rigor ought now and then, in the
latter times, to be relaxed because of the weakness of men; which it
is to be wished were done also in this matter. And it is to be expected
that the churches shall at some time lack pastors if marriage is any
longer forbidden. But while the commandment of God is in force, while the custom of
the Church is well known, while impure celibacy causes many scandals,
adulteries, and other crimes deserving the punishments of just
magistrates, yet it is a marvelous thing that in nothing is more
cruelty exercised than against the marriage of priests. God has
given commandment to honor marriage.",275,1400s
"I zealously
pursued my plan, not without the ridiculous hope of being able to convert
my convertors; for I was simple enough to believe, that could I convince
them of their errors, they would become Protestants; they did not find,
therefore, that facility in the work which they had expected, as I
differed both in regard to will and knowledge from the opinion they had
entertained of me. Protestants, in general, are better instructed in the principles of their
religion than Catholics; the reason is obvious; the doctrine of the
former requires discussion, of the latter a blind submission; the
Catholic must content himself with the decisions of others, the
Protestant must learn to decide for himself; they were not ignorant of
this, but neither my age nor appearance promised much difficulty to men
so accustomed to disputation. They knew, likewise, that I had not
received my first communion, nor the instructions which accompany it;
but, on the other hand, they had no idea of the information I received at
M. Lambercier's, or that I had learned the history of the church and
empire almost by heart at my father's; and though (since that time,
nearly forgot, when warmed by the dispute, very unfortunately for these
gentlemen), it again returned to my memory. A little old priest, but tolerably venerable, held the first conference;
at which we were all convened. On the part of my comrades, it was rather
a catechism than a controversy, and he found more pains in giving them
instruction than answering their objections; but when it came to my turn,
it was a different matter; I stopped him at every article, and did not
spare a single remark that I thought would create a difficulty: this
rendered the conference long and extremely tiresome to the assistants.",3902,1700s

All Hudson’s books breathe this spirit of revolt against our new
enslavement by towns and machinery, and are true oases in an age so
dreadfully resigned to the “pale mechanician.”

But Hudson is not, as Tolstoi was, a conscious prophet; his spirit is
freer, more willful, whimsical--almost perverse--and far more steeped in
love of beauty. If you called him a prophet he would stamp his foot
at you--as he will at me if he reads these words; but his voice is
prophetic, for all that, crying in a wilderness, out of which, at the
call, will spring up roses here and there, and the sweet-smelling grass. I would that every man, woman, and child in England were made to read

eight or ten winter _mamateeks_ or wigwams, each intended to contain
from six to eighteen or twenty people, are distinctly seen close

wigwams. Every winter wigwam has close by it a small square-mouthed or
oblong pit, dug into the earth, about four feet deep, to preserve
their stores, &c. in. Some of these pits were lined with birch-rind. We discovered also in this village the remains of a vapour-bath.",13762,1700s

"The Druids would naturally
apply the term generation, to this act of producing this person, or
divine emanation from the supreme, which we are oblig’d to admit
of: and to affirm him coeval with the supreme. The difficulty of
priority in time, between father and son, would easily be remov’d, by
considering the difference between divine and human generation, the
production of necessary and contingent beings. If an artist produces an admirable and curious piece of mechanism, he
is said to make it; if he produces a person or being altogether like
himself, he is rightly said to generate that person; he begets a son,
’tis an act of filiation. So the like we must affirm of the supreme
being generating another being, with whom only he could communicate
of his goodness from all eternity, and without any beginning; or, in
scripture language, _in whom he always had complacency_. This is what
_Plato_ means, “by love being ancienter than all the gods; that the
kingdom of love is prior to the kingdom of necessity.” And this son
must be a self-existent, all-perfect being, equally as the father,
self-origination only excepted, which the necessary relation or
oeconomy between them forbids.",64626,1600s

"_Pliny_ tells us, that it was set up at _Rome_ in the

_Constantinople_ was like that of _Rome_, the _Greek_ Historians have
been so far from declaring their Opinions concerning it, that in all
their Writings they have not so much as mention’d the Name of it. Yet
it seems very probable to me, that it was like it, and was also seated
in the _Forum_, or near it. For the _Ancient Description of the Wards_
places it in the _Ward_ where the _Forum Augusteum_ and the _Basilica_
stood, to which it adjoin’d. They who have written the History of

Article XXIII (XI): _Of the Marriage of Priests._


Despite the great infamy of their defiled celibacy, the adversaries
have the presumption not only to defend the pontifical law by the
wicked and false pretext of the divine name, but even to exhort the
Emperor and princes, to the disgrace and infamy of the Roman Empire,
not to tolerate the marriage of priests. For thus they speak. [Although the great, unheard-of lewdness, fornication, and adultery
among priests, monks, etc., at the great abbeys, in other churches
and cloisters, has become so notorious throughout the world that
people sing and talk about it, still the adversaries who have
presented the _Confutation_ are so blind and without shame that they
defend the law of the Pope by which marriage is prohibited, and that,
with the specious claim that they are defending a spiritual state. Moreover, although it would be proper for them to be heartily ashamed
of the exceedingly shameful, lewd, abandoned loose life of the
wretches in their abbeys and cloisters, although on this account
alone they should not have the courage to show their face in broad
daylight, although their evil, restless heart and conscience ought to
cause them to tremble, to stand aghast, and to be afraid to lift
their eyes to our excellent Emperor, who loves uprightness, still
they have the courage of the hangman, they act like the very devil
and like all reckless, wanton people, proceeding in blind defiance
and forgetful of all honor and decency.",6744,1400s
"A Night on the Mountain



I sat upon the mountain-side and watched
A tiny barque that skimmed across the lake,
Drifting, like human destiny upon
A world of hidden peril; then she sailed
From out my ken, and mingled with the blue
Of skies unfathomed, while the great round sun
Weakened towards the waves. The whole expanse
Suddenly in the half-light of the dusk
Glimmered and waned. The last rays of the sun
Lit but the tops of trees and mountain-peaks
With tarnished glory; and the water's sheen,
Once blue and bright, grew lustreless, and soon
A welter of red clouds alone betrayed
The passing of the sun. The scattered isles
Uprose, black-looming o'er the tranquil deeps,
Where the reflected heavens wanly showed
A lingering gleam. Already wood and hill
Sank in obscurity.",390,1800s

"This is a new era in
female history. I shall therefore make a few observations on this,
before I proceed to another subject. It is melancholy, when we look into the history of women, to see the low
estimation in which they have been held from the earliest times. It is
possible, because they have not possessed the strength of constitution,
that they may have been thought not to have had the intellect of men. It
is possible, because domestic cares and the rearing of children have
been consigned to them, that other occupations may not have been
considered as falling within the province of their stations.",15304,1700s

"And yet, what choice remains
between this lot and the ignominious scaffold? Nothing can save me but
reconciliation with these men; and, to accomplish this, I have promised
to Langley that Isabella shall marry him ere midnight, and to Mareschal,
that she shall do so without compulsion. I have but one remedy betwixt
me and ruin--her consent to take a suitor whom she dislikes, upon such
short notice as would disgust her, even were he a favoured lover--But
I must trust to the romantic generosity of her disposition; and let
me paint the necessity of her obedience ever so strongly, I cannot
overcharge its reality.”

Having finished this sad chain of reflections upon his perilous
condition, he entered his daughter’s apartment with every nerve bent up
to the support of the argument which he was about to sustain. Though a
deceitful and ambitious man, he was not so devoid of natural affection
but that he was shocked at the part he was about to act, in practising
on the feelings of a dutiful and affectionate child; but the
recollections, that, if he succeeded, his daughter would only be
trepanned into an advantageous match, and that, if he failed, he himself
was a lost man, were quite sufficient to drown all scruples. He found Miss Vere seated by the window of her dressing-room, her head

questionable loans rather than work itself for a living. Like those same
individuals, whatever interest the Far Eastern people may succeed in
raising now, Nature will in the end make them pay dearly for their lack
of principal. The Far Eastern civilization resembles, in fact, more a mechanical
mixture of social elements than a well differentiated chemical compound. For in spite of the great variety of ingredients thrown into its

confidence; I was on earth the sole depository of my own secret. I
might tell it to the winds and to the desart heaths but I must never

the smallest conjecture of the dread reality: I must shrink before the
eye of man lest he should read my father’s guilt in my glazed eyes: I
must be silent lest my faltering voice should betray unimagined
horrors. Over the deep grave of my secret I must heap an impenetrable
heap of false smiles and words: cunning frauds, treacherous laughter

languishing and became more so; I could not endure milk, and was obliged
to discontinue the use of it. Water was at this time the fashionable
remedy for every complaint; accordingly I entered on a course of it, and
so indiscreetly, that it almost released me, not only from my illness but
also from my life. The water I drank was rather hard and difficult to
pass, as water from mountains generally is; in short, I managed so well,
that in the course of two months I totally ruined my stomach, which until

"Of the arts, that which had always had, and now has, the
greatest number of these subordinates, is the woolen; which being
both then, and still, the most powerful body, and first in authority,
supports the greater part of the plebeians and lowest of the people. The lower classes, then, the subordinates not only of the woolen,
but also of the other arts, were discontented, from the causes just
mentioned; and their apprehension of punishment for the burnings and
robberies they had committed, did not tend to compose them. Meetings
took place in different parts during the night, to talk over the past,
and to communicate the danger in which they were, when one of the most
daring and experienced, in order to animate the rest, spoke thus:

""If the question now were, whether we should take up arms, rob and burn

would think it worthy of further consideration, and should, perhaps,
prefer poverty and safety to the dangerous pursuit of an uncertain good. But as we have already armed, and many offenses have been committed, it

ourselves from the consequences of what is already done. I certainly

for them which I ought to have; but, if they are worthies, they are
not to be ranked amongst the three whom I have named, and who are
established in their reputation. Before I quitted the comparison betwixt epic poetry and tragedy, I
should have acquainted my judge with one advantage of the former
over the latter, which I now casually remember out of the preface

matter which: ""The style of the heroic poem is, and ought to be, more

compound called _tombach_; and with zinc it makes the useful compound
commonly called _brass_, in which zinc is about one third of its weight. Copper is sometimes found native; but commonly mixed with sulphur, in
ores of a red, green, or blue colour. Copper being an earlier discovery than that of iron, was formerly used
for weapons and the shoeing of horses; and the ancients had a method,
with which we are not well acquainted, of giving it a considerable
degree of hardness, so that a sword made of it might have a pretty good
edge. LECTURE XXV. _Of Iron._

Iron is a metal of a bluish colour, of the greatest hardness, the most

"I have endeavoured to expose the fallacy of that argument which infers
an unlimited progress from a partial improvement, the limits of which

many instances in which a decided progress has been observed, where yet
it would be a gross absurdity to suppose that progress indefinite. But
towards the extinction of the passion between the sexes, no observable
progress whatever has hitherto been made. To suppose such an
extinction, therefore, is merely to offer an unfounded conjecture,
unsupported by any philosophical probabilities. It is a truth, which history I am afraid makes too clear, that some men

air have a flame, whether large or small, formed on its surface, the
current is produced with the greatest ease; but not the least difficulty

great. Even its moral tendency is by no means to be overlooked. The value of music, to soothe the feelings and cast out the evil

Doe, the combmaker of London Bridge (who naively tells us how one day

celebrity in London as a popular preacher, and approached the nearest to
a position of worldly honour. Though we must probably reject the idea
that he ever filled the office of Chaplain to the Lord Mayor of London,
Sir John Shorter, the fact that he is styled ""his Lordship's teacher""
proves that there was some relation more than that of simple friendship
between the chief magistrate and the Bedford minister. But the society

his own, but his heart was with his own humble folk at Bedford.",1037,1800s

with his fellows,” prejudice and superstition, as the case confirms, are
stronger. Prejudice, Lillian Smith points out, declares that there are
“‘sacred and profane’ people according to criteria as infantile as skin

The troubled mind to change its native woes? Or lead us willing from ourselves, to see

New views to life, and teach us how to live;

Their aid they yield to all:  they never shun

Extent of _Constantinople_, in these Words: _Constantinople_, says he,

of importing Corn in great Quantities; but at present not all the Ships
of Burthen from_ Ægypt, Asia, Syria, Phœnicia, _and many other Nations,

Constantine, _by unpeopling other Cities, has transported thither_. _Zosimus_ also, though otherwise no very good Friend to _Constantine_
on the score of his Religion, yet frankly owns, that he wonderfully
enlarged it; and that the _Isthmus_ was enclosed by a Wall from Sea
to Sea, to the Distance of fifteen Furlongs beyond the Walls of old
_Byzantium_. But to what Extent soever _Constantine_ might enlarge its
Bounds, yet the Emperors who succeeded him have extended them farther,
and have enclosed the City with much wider Walls than those built by
_Constantine_, and permitted them to build so closely one House to
another, and that even in their Market Places, that they could not
walk the Streets without Danger, they were so crowded with Men and
Cattle. Upon this Account it was, that a great part of the Sea which
runs round the City was in some Places dry’d up, where by fixing Posts

City large enough for the Reception of an infinite Multitude of People.",53083,1400s

pen, or by signs made with his fingers, to represent letters. I observed
that he had so far forgot the pronunciation of the language, that when he
attempted to speak, none of his words had distinct articulation, though his
relations could sometimes understand his meaning. But, which is much to the
point, he assured me, that in his dreams he always imagined that people
conversed with him by signs or writing, and never that he heard any one

has also lost the ideas of them; though the organs of speech still retain
somewhat of their usual habits of articulation.",15707,1700s

terrible depths of which were for ever staring us in the face. A
misunderstanding amongst our enemies, whereby England became detached
from the grand alliance; the undue contempt of Prince Eugene for our
generals, out of which arose the battle of Denain; saved us from the
gulf. Peace came, and a peace, too, infinitely better than that we
should have ardently embraced if our enemies had agreed amongst

"Then go your ways and mind your own businesses."" The following, however, must be added, for the benefit of all of whom
it may concern:--The good man to whom we owe fables and stories of
sempiternal authority only used his tool on them, having taken his
material from others; but the workmanship expended on these little
figures has given them a high value; and although he was, like M.
Louis Ariosto, vituperated for thinking of idle pranks and trifles,
there is a certain insect engraved by him which has since become a
monument of perennity more assured than that of the most solidly built
works. In the especial jurisprudence of wit and wisdom the custom is
to steal more dearly a leaf wrested from the book of Nature and Truth,
than all the indifferent volumes from which, however fine they be, it
is impossible to extract either a laugh or a tear. The author has
licence to say this without any impropriety, since it is not his
intention to stand upon tiptoe in order to obtain an unnatural height,
but because it is a question of the majesty of his art, and not of
himself--a poor clerk of the court, whose business it is to have ink
in his pen, to listen to the gentleman on the bench, and take down the
sayings of each witness in this case. He is responsible for
workmanship, Nature for the rest, since from the Venus of Phidias the
Athenian, down to the little old fellow, Godenot, commonly called the
Sieur Breloque, a character carefully elaborated by one of the most
celebrated authors of the present day, everything is studied from the

a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should
show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into
His marvellous light"" (1 Peter ii. 9). These two things stand thus. First, as regards kingship, every Christian
is by faith so exalted above all things that, in spiritual power, he is
completely lord of all things, so that nothing whatever can do him
any hurt; yea, all things are subject to him, and are compelled to be
subservient to his salvation. Thus Paul says, ""All things work together

received. The Mètifs, or, as they are sometimes called, Bois brulés,
have displayed the most striking ability as steersmen of boats, through
the most difficult rapids, and in the navigation of the rivers; and if
advantages were given them in education, they have capacities of
usefulness which might adorn the highest stations of civilized life. Of
the moral degradation, however, of these people, in common with that of
the Canadian voyageurs, it is difficult to exhibit an accurate picture. Suffice it to say, that it is a degradation which, in some respects,

"Nor is it perhaps amiss to remark, that in _Maniacal_ People, as is
frequently observ’d, a Quadruple Dose of _Opium_ will scarce produce
any considerable Effect: Now in Persons so affected, the Mind is deeply
ingaged and taken up with some _Images_ or other, as Love, Anger,
_&c._ so that it is not to be so easily moved or diverted by those
pleasing Representations which it would attend to at another time, and
upon which the Virtues of this Medicine do in a great measure depend. Besides this, those who are _Maniacal_ do to a Wonder bear the Injuries
of Cold, Hunger, _&c._ and have a prodigious degree of Muscular Force,
which argues the Texture of their _Blood_ to be very strong, and the
Cohæsion of its _Globules_ great; so that the Spirituous Parts of the
_Opiate_ cannot make that Disjunction and Rarefaction of this Fluid in
Them, which it does in ordinary Bodies and Constitutions. Many are the Immprovements which might be made of this Theory, with
relation to the Practice of Physick; but these will be obvious enough
to one instructed in the Animal _Œconomy_. To conclude then as to the Subject in Hand, it is very plain that there
needs no more to make _Opium_ prove Destructive or a _Poison_, than to
take too great a quantity of It; for then It must Inflame the Stomach,
and Rarefie the Blood to such a Degree, that the Vessels cannot again
recover their Tone, whereupon Apoplectic Symptoms, _&c._ will insue. To be convinced of this, I forced into the Stomach of a small Dog about
half a Drachm of Crude _Opium_ dissolved in Boiling Water.",53202,1600s

"This course was the occasion of his victory and
the ruin of the Milanese; for the Venetians, confident of peace, were
slow in preparing for war, and the Milanese finding the truce concluded,
the enemy withdrawn, and the Venetians their friends, felt assured that
the count had determined to abandon his design. This idea injured them
in two ways: one, by neglecting to provide for their defense; the next,
that, being seed-time, they sowed a large quantity of grain in the
country which the enemy had evacuated, and thus brought famine upon
themselves. On the other hand, all that was injurious to his enemies
favored the count, and the time gave him opportunity to take breath and
provide himself with assistance. The Florentines during the war of Lombardy had not declared in favor of
either party, or assisted the count either in defense of the Milanese or
since; for he never having been in need had not pressingly requested
it; and they only sent assistance to the Venetians after the rout at
Caravaggio, in pursuance of the treaty. Count Francesco, standing now
alone, and not knowing to whom else he could apply, was compelled to
request immediate aid of the Florentines, publicly from the state, and
privately from friends, particularly from Cosmo de' Medici, with whom he

through the exhibition of some tangible, lasting results of the leisure
so spent--in a manner analogous to the familiar exhibition of tangible,
lasting products of the labour performed for the gentleman of leisure by
handicraftsmen and servants in his employ. The lasting evidence of productive labour is its material
product--commonly some article of consumption. In the case of exploit it
is similarly possible and usual to procure some tangible result that may
serve for exhibition in the way of trophy or booty. At a later phase
of the development it is customary to assume some badge of insignia of

not in the society of more virtuous persons, for she is herself naturally
very good; but she is spoiled by bad company. She has an ugly fool for
her husband, who has been badly brought up; and the examples which are
constantly before her eyes are so pernicious that they have corrupted her
and made her careless of her reputation. Her amiable, unaffected manners
are highly delightful to foreigners. Among others, some Bavarians have
fallen in love with her, as well as the Prince Ragotzky; but she

bending beneath a heavy burden, and he stumbled at every step. When he came up to the three Apostles, they were not lying down
asleep as they had been the first time, but their heads were covered,
and they had sunk down on their knees, in an attitude often assumed by
the people of that country when in sorrow or desiring to pray. They had
fallen asleep, overpowered by grief and fatigue. Jesus, trembling and
groaning, drew nigh to them, and they awoke. But when, by the light of the moon, they saw him standing before

a fresh attack and killed one Spaniard, but we drove them back, killing
several of their chiefs, and took a great many prisoners. Our cavalry had
been ordered out to charge the Mexicans, but finding them in great force,
they sent back for assistance. The whole of our army now sallied forth and
completely defeated the enemy, from whom we took several prisoners. From

endless bravura passages introduced at haphazard irrespective of the
dramatic situation, that recurrent _crescendo_ that Rossini brought
into vogue, are now an integral part of every composition; those vocal
fireworks result in a sort of babbling, chattering, vaporous mucic,
of which the sole merit depends on the greater or less fluency of the
singer and his rapidity of vocalization. “The Italian school has lost sight of the high mission of art. Instead
of elevating the crowd, it has condescended to the crowd; it has won its
success only by accepting the suffrages of all comers, and appealing to
the vulgar minds which constitute the majority.",1873,1700s

afforded, and for the greatest part in coffee-houses, or in passing up
and down the streets.”  For the latter part of this apology he was
accused of writing “to the rumbling of his chariot wheels.”  He had read,
he says, “but little poetry throughout his whole life; and for fifteen
years before had not written a hundred verses except one copy of Latin
verses in praise of a friend’s book.”  He thinks, and with some reason,
that from such a performance perfection cannot be expected; but he finds
another reason for the severity of his censurers, which he expresses in
language such as Cheapside easily furnished. “I am not free of the
Poet’s Company, having never kissed the governor’s hands: mine is
therefore not so much as a permission poem, but a downright interloper. Those gentlemen, who carry on their poetical trade in a joint stock,
would certainly do what they could to sink and ruin an unlicensed
adventurer, notwithstanding I disturbed none of their factories, nor
imported any goods they have ever dealt in.”  He had lived in the City
till he had learned its note. That “Prince Arthur” found many readers is certain; for in two years it
had three editions, a very uncommon instance of favourable reception, at
a time when literary curiosity was yet confined to particular classes of
the nation.",5101,1700s
"Twenty notable
burgesses of the town were summoned to the castle, and the lords and
ladies sat with these upon the benches. The King, wearing his orders,
took his seat when the two prisoners were placed in the dock. By their contradictory statements, ever-increasing embarrassment, and
unveracious assertions, the jury were soon convinced of their guilt. The
unhappy youth was their brother, and had inherited property from their
mother, he being her child by a second husband. So these monsters
murdered him for revenge and greed.",3850,1600s
"Hilarius’ grip failed; he slid to the ground bruised and sore from the
unaccustomed strain, but well pleased. True, he had gained no counsel
from the Ankret, but he had seen the holy man—ay, even when he was
visited by a heavenly messenger, and that in itself should bring a
blessing. He turned to go, when a sudden thought came to him. There was
no one in sight, no sound but the failing cry from the tired old saint. Hilarius doffed his cap again and his fresh young voice rose clear and
sweet through the thin still air:—

    “_Iesu_, _dulcis memoria_,
    _Dans vera cordis gaudia_;
    _Sed super mel et omnia_
    _Dulcis ejus praesentia_.”

At the fourth stanza his memory failed him; but he could hear the Ankret
crooning to himself the words he had sung, and crying softly like a
little child.",789,1800s
"At least, in order to dissipate the
undeniable obscurities, and to reconcile the apparent contradictions found
in his works,—to distinguish, in short, the numerous passages in which
without, perhaps, losing sight internally of his own peculiar belief, he
yet falls into the phraseology and mechanical solutions of his age,—we
must distinguish such passages from those in which the form corresponds to
the substance, and in which, therefore, the nature and essential laws of
vital action are expressed, as far as his researches had unveiled them to
his own mind, without disguise. To effect this, we must, as it were, climb
up on his shoulders, and look at the same objects in a distincter form,
because seen from the more commanding point of view furnished by himself. This has, indeed, been more than once attempted already, and, in one
instance, with so evident a display of power and insight as announces in
the assertor and vindicator of the Hunterian Theory a congenial intellect,
and a disciple in whom Hunter himself would have exulted. Would that this
attempt had been made on a larger scale, that the writer to whom I
refer(1) had in consequence developed his opinions systematically, and
carried them yet further back, even to their ultimate principle! But this the scientific world has yet to expect; or it is more than
probable that the present humble endeavour would have been superseded, or
confined, at least, to the task of restating the opinion of my predecessor
with such modifications as the differences that will always exist between
men who have thought independently, and each for himself, have never
failed to introduce, even on problems of far easier and more obvious
solution.",24346,1700s
"She hovered around me maternally,
obviously trying to cheer me. “The paper says still warmer,” she ventured. “The thermometer is
ninety-two now.”

“And this coffee is two hundred and fifty,” I said, putting down my
cup. “Where is Euphemia? I haven’t seen her around, or heard a dish
smash all day.”

“Euphemia is in bed,” Mrs. Klopton said gravely.",1869,1800s
"He tied them together, and carried them
towards the village. As he came in sight, those who had wished his
death were disappointed, but the Mudjékewis, who was really his friend,
rejoiced. ""See!"" said he, ""but one person approaches--it is my
brother-in-law."" He then threw down the carcasses in triumph, but it
was found that by their death he had restored two inhabitants to the
before empty lodges, and he afterwards perceived that every one of
these beings, whom he killed, had the like effect, so that the
depopulated part of the village soon became filled with people.",21620,1700s
"From these causes proceeded the ruin as well as the origin and extension
of many cities. Among those which were ruined were Aquileia, Luni,
Chiusi, Popolonia, Fiesole, and many others. The new cities were Venice,
Sienna, Ferrara, Aquila, with many towns and castles which for brevity
we omit. Those which became extended were Florence, Genoa, Pisa,
Milan, Naples, and Bologna; to all of which may be added, the ruin and
restoration of Rome, and of many other cities not previously mentioned. From this devastation and new population arose new languages, as we see
in the different dialects of France, Spain and Italy; which, partaking
of the native idiom of the new people and of the old Roman, formed a
new manner of discourse.",2464,1400s

          Volume 5. THE PRINCESS BETROTHED TO THE
                        KING OF GARBA


          WHAT various ways in which a thing is told
          Some truth abuse, while others fiction hold;
          In stories we invention may admit;
          But diff'rent 'tis with what historick writ;
          Posterity demands that truth should then
          Inspire relation, and direct the pen. ALACIEL'S story's of another kind,
          And I've a little altered it, you'll find;
          Faults some may see, and others disbelieve;
          'Tis all the same:--'twill never make me grieve;
          Alaciel's mem'ry, it is very clear,
          Can scarcely by it lose; there's naught to fear. Two facts important I have kept in view,
          In which the author fully I pursue;
          The one--no less than eight the belle possessed,
          Before a husband's sight her eyes had blessed;
          The other is, the prince she was to wed
          Ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed,
          But thought, perhaps, the beauty she had got
          Would prove to any one a happy lot. HOWE'ER this fair, amid adventures dire,
          More sufferings shared than malice could desire;
          Though eight times, doubtless, she exchanged her knight
          No proof, that she her spouse was led to slight;
          'Twas gratitude, compassion, or good will;
          The dread of worse;--she'd truly had her fill;
          Excuses just, to vindicate her fame,
          Who, spite of troubles, fanned the monarch's flame:
          Of eight the relict, still a maid received ;--
          Apparently, the prince her pure believed;
          For, though at times we may be duped in this,
          Yet, after such a number--strange to miss!",5279,1600s

"But so vigilant and watchful, when the captains saw them,
were they, that though sometimes their shot would go by their ears with a
whiz, yet they did them no harm. By these two guns the townsfolk made no
question but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai, and well enough to
secure the gate; but they had not much cause to boast of what execution
they did, as by what follows will be gathered. The famous Mansoul had also some other small pieces in it, of the which
they made use against the camp of Shaddai. They from the camp also did as stoutly, and with as much of that as may
in truth be called valour, let fly as fast at the town and at Ear-gate;
for they saw that, unless they could break open Ear-gate, it would be but
in vain to batter the wall. Now the King’s captains had brought with
them several slings, and two or three battering-rams; with their slings,
therefore, they battered the houses and people of the town, and with
their rams they sought to break Ear-gate open.",395,1600s

"The Queen my mother was greatly uneasy on account of the
behaviour of these young men, fearing that, if my brother did not join
them in this festivity, it might be attended with some bad consequence,
especially as the day was likely to produce scenes of revelry and
debauch; she, therefore, prevailed on the King to permit her to dine on
the wedding-day at St. Maur, and take my brother and me with her. This
was the day before Shrove Tuesday; and we returned in the evening, the
Queen my mother having well lectured my brother, and made him consent to
appear at the ball, in order not to displease the King. But this rather served to make matters worse than better, for Maugiron
and his party began to attack him with such violent speeches as would
have offended any one of far less consequence. They said he needed not
to have given himself the trouble of dressing, for he was not missed in
the afternoon; but now, they supposed, he came at night as the most
suitable time; with other allusions to the meanness of his figure and
smallness of stature. All this was addressed to the bride, who sat near
him, but spoken out on purpose that he might hear it.",3839,1500s
"""The Queen shares with the Cardinal in the common hatred, and the Duc
d'Orleans with La Riviere in the universal contempt of the people. If,
out of mere complaisance, you abet their measures, you will share in the
hatred of the public. It is true that you are above their contempt; but
then their dread of you will be so great that it will grievously embitter
the hatred they will then bear to you, and the contempt they have already
for the others, so that what is at present only a serious wound in the
State will perhaps become incurable and mortal. I am sensible you have
grounds to be diffident of the behaviour of a body consisting of above
two hundred persons, who are neither capable of governing nor being
governed. I own the thought is perplexing; but such favourable
circumstances seem to offer themselves at this juncture that matters are
much simplified.",3843,1600s

"And being a witch as
well, she could abrogate those laws in a moment; or at least so clog
their wheels and rust their bearings, that they would not work at all. But we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done. The first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was,
that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down, she flew
from her arms towards the ceiling. Happily, the resistance of the air
brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it. There she
remained, horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms, kicking and

called me the Beauty of Ballinacree, a fine name for a woman. MICHAEL

horses they have below racing in Arklow. It’s easy pleased you are,
Sarah Casey, easy pleased with a big word, or the liar speaks it.",1328,1800s

turned from the phone something within her withered, became as dead as
the drifting leaves with their dark autumnal mottlings. She did not even pause to call Tommy in from the yard. She rushed
upstairs, then down again, gathering up her hat, gloves and purse,
making sure she had enough change to pay for the taxi. The ride to the office was a nightmare ... Tall buildings swept past,

"I experienced immediate
relief from sickness, both at Dr. Laidley’s and at Kamalia, during the
harmattan. Indeed, the air during the rainy season is so loaded with
moisture that clothes, shoes, trunks, and everything that is not close to
the fire becomes damp and mouldy, and the inhabitants may be said to live
in a sort of vapour-bath; but this dry wind braces up the solids, which
were before relaxed, gives a cheerful flow of spirits, and is even
pleasant to respiration. Its ill effects are, that it produces chaps in
the lips, and afflicts many of the natives with sore eyes. Whenever the grass is sufficiently dry the negroes set it on fire; but in
Ludamar and other Moorish countries this practice is not allowed, for it
is upon the withered stubble that the Moors feed their cattle until the
return of the rains. The burning the grass in Manding exhibits a scene
of terrific grandeur.",5305,1700s

"The effects of this freebooting soon became apparent. The risks to be
assumed by the owners of vessels and the shippers of merchandise became
so enormous that Spanish commerce was practically swept away from these
waters. No vessel dared to venture out of port excepting under escort
of powerful men-of-war, and even then they were not always secure from
molestation. Exports from Central and South America were sent to Europe
by way of the Strait of Magellan, and little or none went through the
passes between the Bahamas and the Caribbees. So at last ""buccaneering,"" as it had come to be generically called,
ceased to pay the vast dividends that it had done at first.",973,1800s

Tyrants, took care that several Copies should be transcribed, (though

or means to promote the former Depredations and Extortions by the
Tyranny aforesaid) and sent them to several _Indian_ Provinces. They,

Order, but behav'd themselves most inordinately and irregularly, having
perused these Diplomata or Constitutions, before the new made Judges,

the assistance of those (as 'tis credibly rumour'd, nor is it repugnant

of Love and Fear of God, were so audacious as to contemn and set at

Traytors, demeaning themselves like Blood-Thirsty Tyrants, destitute
and void of all Humanity. More particularly this appear'd in the _Perusian_ Kingdoms, where _An. Dom._ 1542, they acted such Horrid and Stupendous Enormities, that the
like were never known or heard in _America_, or throughout the whole
World before that time: Nor were they only practised upon the
_Indians_, who were mostly destroy'd, but upon themselves also, God
permitting them by his just Judgement to be their own Executioners, and

all, not in wrath nor in lust, but in unbelief, in order that those
who pretend that they are fulfilling the law by works of purity and
benevolence (which are social and human virtues) may not presume
that they will therefore be saved, but, being included in the sin of
unbelief, may either seek mercy, or be justly condemned. But when God sees that truth is ascribed to Him, and that in the faith
of our hearts He is honoured with all the honour of which He is worthy,
then in return He honours us on account of that faith, attributing to
us truth and righteousness. For faith does truth and righteousness in
rendering to God what is His; and therefore in return God gives glory
to our righteousness. It is true and righteous that God is true and
righteous; and to confess this and ascribe these attributes to Him, this
it is to be true and righteous. Thus He says, ""Them that honour Me I
will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed"" (1 Sam.",1911,1400s

writes, that this Pillar was made of eight Stones, and that at the
Joints of it, it was covered round with Wreathed Laurels made of Brass,

"He suffers deeply
and secretly; and I dare say he will long and bitterly lament both mother
and child."" The reader will, I think, feel with me, after reading the foregoing
letters, as well as those of Mrs. Sheridan, given in the course of this
work, that the impression which they altogether leave on the mind is in
the highest degree favorable to the characters both of husband and wife. There is, round the whole, an atmosphere of kindly, domestic feeling,
which seems to answer for the soundness of the hearts that breathed in
it. The sensibility, too, displayed by Sheridan at this period, was not
that sort of passionate return to former feelings, which the prospect of
losing what it once loved might awaken in even the most alienated
heart;--on the contrary, there was a depth and mellowness in his sorrow
which could proceed from long habits of affection alone. The idea,
indeed, of seeking solace for the loss of the mother in the endearments
of the children would occur only to one who had been accustomed to find
happiness in his home, and who therefore clung for comfort to what
remained of the wreck.",7775,1700s

together in one house in the air, who now and then fall out and quarrel
about a thick and stiff outstretched seal skin (because such a skin, if
beaten as a drum, has some likeness to the noise of thunder); while they
are thus by the ears together, down comes the house with great bouncing
and cracking, and the lamps are broken, the fires and broken pieces fly
about in the air, and this, in their philosophy, is thunder and

Kamaiakan may be an original priest of Montezuma’s; no one knows his

advance--perhaps even to China. A trade with China had been a major objective of English adventure

had its origins in an attempt to find a northeast passage around the
Scandinavian peninsula leading to Cathay--Marco Polo's fabulous kingdom

"E'en I, who now your majesty address,
          Continued he, am sorry to confess,
          The very day I left my native earth,

          To wait upon a prince of royal birth,
          Was forced t'acknowledge cuckoldom among
          The gods who rule the matrimonial throng,
          And sacrifice thereto with aching heart

          Yet, since 'twere better full belief to gain,
          A glimpse of such a fact I should obtain,
          Pray bring me thither; instantly our wight;
          Astolphus led, where both his ears and sight
          Full proof receiv'd, which struck the prince with awe;
          Who stood amaz'd at what he heard and saw. But soon reflection's all-convincing pow'r
          Induced the king vexation to devour;
          True courtier-like, who dire misfortunes braves,
          Feels sprouting horns, yet smiles at fools and knaves:
          Our wives, said he, a pretty trick have play'd,

          Our names we'll change; no servants we shall need;--
          For your relation I desire to pass,
          So you'll true freedom use; then with a lass
          We more at ease shall feel, more pleasure gain;
          Than if attended by my usual train. JOCONDE with joy the king's proposal heard;
          On which the latter with his friend conferr'd;
          Said he, 'twere surely right to have a book,
          In which to place the names of those we hook,

In this passage we may take notice of the following Particulars. And first,
he calls it a White _Mexican_ Wood, whereas (not to mention that
_Mornardes_ informs us that it is brought out of _Nova Hispania_) the Wood
that we have met with in several places, and employ'd as _Lignum
Nephriticum_, was not White, but for the most part of a much Darker Colour,
not unlike that of the Sadder Colour'd Wood of Juniper. 'Tis true, that
_Monardes_ himself also says, that the Wood is White; and it is affirm'd,
that the Wood which is of a Sadder Colour is Adulterated by being Imbu'd
with the Tincture of a Vegetable, in whose Decoction it is steep'd. But
having purposely enquir'd of the Eminentest of our _English_ Druggists, he
peremptorily deny'd it. And indeed, having consider'd some of the fairest
Round pieces of this Wood that I could meet with in these Parts, I had
Opportunity to take notice that in one or two of them it was the External
part of the Wood that was White, and the more Inward part that was of the
other Colour, the contrary of which would probably have appear'd, if the
Wood had been Adulterated after the afore-mention'd manner.",14504,1600s

Stomach and Vessels do continually breathe and send forth, which does
lodge or center in the Mouth, especially between the Teeth, and on the
Gums; and some People having fouler Stomachs than others, such do
breathe forth very sour, stinking, phlegmy Matter, which does not only
increase the Pain, but causeth the Teeth to become loose and rotten: And
for want of continual cleansing and washing, those Breathings and this
Phlegmy Matter turns to Putrifaction, which does eat away the Gums, as
though Worms had eaten them: And this Defect is generally attributed to
the Disease called the _Scurvey_; but it is a mistake: the Cause is

by no means framed for gallantry; but he had wit, and a mind fertile in
intrigues, with a measureless ambition that was sometimes pushed to
madness. His wife was pretty, not clever, quarrelsome, and under a
virginal appearance; mischievous to the last degree. As daughter of a

With unsteady footsteps, and covered with blushes, Juliet repaired to
the parlour, where Harleigh, with delighted, yet trembling impatience,
was awaiting her arrival. The door was half open, and he had placed himself at a distant window,
to force her entire entrance into the room, before she could see him, or
speak; but, that point gained, he hastened to shut it, exclaiming, 'How

other fathers; doctrines which have always been adopted by the Popes, by
the Councils, and by the Church itself. The bull, as soon as published,

Captivity:  For they being taken off in War, none but Women and

Brutes were more happy than they:  To which Two Species of Tyranny as

the Extirptaion and Desolation of this People, was Gold only; that
thereby growing opulent in a short time, they might arrive at once at
such Degrees and Dignities, as were no wayes consistent with their
Persons. Finally, in one word, their Ambition and Avarice, than which the heart
of Man never entertained greater, and the vast Wealth of those Regions;
the Humility and Patience of the Inhabitants (which made their approach
to these Lands more facil and easie) did much promote the business:
Whom they so despicably contemned, that they treated them (I speak of
things which I was an Eye Witness of, without the least fallacy) not as
Beasts, which I cordially wished they would, but as the most abject
dung and filth of the Earth; and so sollicitous they were of their Life

understanding the true Faith or Sacraments. And this also is as really
true as the praecendent Narration (which the very Tyrants and cruel
Murderers cannot deny without the stigma of a lye) that the _Spaniards_
never received any injury from the _Indians_, but that they rather
reverenced them as Persons descended from Heaven, until that they were

violent Torments, and injust Butcheries. ----------------------------------------------------------------------

queen; but to-morrow they will be dressed differently, because this
representation lasts no longer than to-day."" They further asked, ""Since
he represented the Lord, and she the church, why did she sit at his
right hand?"" The wise one replied, ""Because there are two things which
constitute the marriage of the Lord with the church--love and wisdom;
the Lord is love, and the church is wisdom; and wisdom is at the right
hand of love; for every member of the church is wise as of himself, and

low gruff voice of a veteran seaman, as he issued, in technical
language, the necessary orders for the management of the vessel,
prevailed every where along her decks. The dress and general appearance
of this individual announced him for a petty officer of the royal
service; and it was evident, from the tone of authority with which he

consisting of about thirty souls, and chiefly veterans of the same
class, were assembled along the gangways, each man wearing a brace of
pistols in the belt, which, moreover, secured a naked cutlass around
his loins; and these now lingered near the several guns that were

boiling Water upon the Powder, and let it stand to infuse four or five
Minutes before the Fire: and this Method, in my Judgment, much exceeds

          The daughter scared; the father in a fume;

"But at
a later period it became still further demoralized and fell under
suspicion of witchcraft. There is no doubt that the Indian held medicine close to spiritual
things, but in this also he has been much misunderstood; in fact
everything that he held sacred is indiscriminately called “medicine,” in
the sense of mystery or magic. As a doctor he was originally very adroit
and often successful. He employed only healing bark, roots, and leaves
with whose properties he was familiar, using them in the form of a
distillation or tea and always singly. The stomach or internal bath
was a valuable discovery of his, and the vapor or Turkish bath was in
general use.",340,1800s
"But it is the object of a liberal education not only to obscure the
knowledge of one sex by another, but to magnify the natural differences
between the two. Man is a creature who lives not upon bread alone, but
principally by catchwords; and the little rift between the sexes is
astonishingly widened by simply teaching one set of catchwords to the
girls and another to the boys. To the first, there is shown but a very
small field of experience, and taught a very trenchant principle for
judgment and action; to the other, the world of life is more largely
displayed, and their rule of conduct is proportionally widened. They are
taught to follow different virtues, to hate different vices, to place
their ideal, even for each other, in different achievements. What should

"They did not consider how to contradict the world, or distinguish
themselves as a party from others; it being none of their business, as it
was not their interest; no, it was not the result of consultation, or a
framed design, by which to declare or recommend schism or novelty. But
God having given them a sight of themselves, they saw the whole world in
the same glass of truth; and sensibly discerned the affections and
passions of men, and the rise and tendency of things; what it was that
gratified the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of
life, which are not of the Father, but of the world. And from thence
sprang, in the night of darkness and apostacy, which hath been over
people through their degeneration from the light and Spirit of God, these
and many other vain customs, which are seen, by the heavenly day of
Christ that dawns in the soul, to be either wrong in their original, or,
by time and abuse, hurtful in their practice. And though these things
seemed trivial to some, and rendered these people stingy and conceited in
such persons' opinion; there was and is more in them, than they were, or
are, aware of. It was not very easy to our primitive friends to make themselves sights
and spectacles, and the scorn and derision of the world; which they
easily foresaw must be the consequence of so unfashionable a conversation
in it: but here was the wisdom of God seen in the foolishness of these
things; first, that they discovered the satisfaction and concern that
people had in and for the fashions of this world, notwithstanding their
high pretences to another: in that any disappointment about them came so
very near them, as that the greatest honesty, virtue, wisdom, and
ability, were unwelcome without them.",19377,1600s

Conjugial is with those of their clan who are naked; and it was shown
that they perceive this by virtue of a spiritual idea concerning
marriage, which idea being communicated to me was to the effect, that
a likeness of the interiors was formed by the conjunction of good and
truth, consequently of love and faith, and that from that conjunction
descending by influx into the body conjugial love comes into
existence. For all things which belong to the mind (_animus_) are
exhibited in some natural form in the body, consequently in the form
of conjugial love, when the interiors of two mutually love each other,
and from that love also desire to will and to think the one as the
other, and thus to be together and be conjoined as to the interiors
which are of the mind (_mens_). Hence the spiritual affection, which
is of the minds, becomes natural affection in the body, and clothes

"They ""admonished""
the Colleague, but did not prevent the appointment of Salvestro, for the
design was discovered by the Eight, who took care to render all attempts
upon the drawing futile. Salvestro Alammano de' Medici was therefore drawn Gonfalonier, and,
being one of the noblest popular families, he could not endure that the
people should be oppressed by a few powerful persons. Having resolved
to put an end to their insolence, and perceiving the middle classes
favorably disposed, and many of the highest of the people on his side,
he communicated his design to Benedetto Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi, and
Georgio Scali, who all promised their assistance. They, therefore,
secretly draw up a law which had for its object to revive the
restrictions upon the nobility, to retrench the authority of the
Capitani di Parte, and recall the _ammoniti_ to their dignity. In order
to attempt and obtain their ends, at one and the same time, having to
consult, first the Colleagues and then the Councils, Salvestro being

"In this we see clearly that the Apostle lays down this rule for a
Christian life: that all our works should be directed to the advantage
of others, since every Christian has such abundance through his faith
that all his other works and his whole life remain over and above
wherewith to serve and benefit his neighbour of spontaneous goodwill. To this end he brings forward Christ as an example, saying, ""Let this
mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form
of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of
no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made
in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, and became obedient unto death"" (Phil. ii. 5-8). This most

conquest were not ascertained. The circumstances attending the points of difference with Great
Britain, were still more serious; because, in their progress, a temper
unfavourable to accommodation had been uniformly displayed. The resentments produced by the various calamities war had occasioned,
were not terminated with their cause. The idea that Great Britain was
the natural enemy of America had become habitual. Believing it
impossible for that nation to have relinquished its views of conquest,

sentiment contained in the declaration of independence, ""to hold them

to live long and healthy, and die without sickness of body or
mind, but by mere dissolution, they must submit to live regularly,
since the cannot otherwise expect to enjoy the fruits of such a
life, which are almost infinite in number, and each of them, in
particular, of infinite value. For, as such regularity keeps the
humours of the body cleansed and purified; it suffers no vapors to
ascend from the stomach to the head; hence the brain of him, who
lives in that manner, enjoys such a constant serenity, that he is
always perfectly master of himself. He, therefore, easily soars
above the low and groveling concerns of this life, to the exalted
and beautiful contemplation of heavenly things, to his exceeding
great comfort and satisfaction; because he, by this means, comes
to consider, know, and understand that, which otherwise he would
never have considered, known, or understood; that is, how great
is the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Deity. He then

"And this I take to be the reason why many have believed and asserted the
Hairs of a man’s head to be hollow, and like so many small pipes perforated
from end to end. Now, though I grant that by an _Analogie_ one may suppose them so, and from
the _Polonian_ disease one may believe them such, yet I think we have not
the least encouragement to either from the _Microscope_, much less
positively to assert them such. And perhaps the very essence of the _Plica
Polonica_ may be the hairs growing hollow, and of an unnatural
constitution. And as for the _Analogie_, though I am apt enough to think that the hairs
of several Animals may be perforated somewhat like a Cane, or at least have
a kind of pith in them, first, because they seem as ’twere a kind of
Vegetable growing on an Animal, which growing, they say, remains a long
while after the Animal is dead, and therefore should like other Vegetables
have a pith; and secondly, because Horns and Feathers, and Porcupine’s
Quils, and Cats Brisles, and the long hairs of Horses, which come very
neer the nature of a mans hair, seem all of them to have a kind of pith,
and some of them to be porous, yet I think it not (in these cases, where we
have such helps for the sense as the _Microscope_ affords) safe concluding
or building on more then we sensibly know, since we may, with examining,
find that Nature does in the make of the same kind of substance, often vary
her method in framing of it: Instances enough to confirm this we may find
in the Horns of several creatures: as what a vast difference is there
between the Horns of an Oxe, and those of some sorts of Staggs as to their
shape? and even in the hairs of several creatures, we find a vast
difference, as the hair of a man’s head seems, as I said before, long,
_Cylindrical_ and sometime a little _Prismatical_, solid or impervious, and
very small; the hair of an _Indian_ Deer (a part of the middle of which is
described in the third Figure of the fifth _Scheme_, marked with F) is
bigger in compass through all the middle of it, then the Bristle of an
Hogg, but the end of it is smaller then the hair of any kind of Animal (as
may be seen by the Figure G) the whole belly of it, which is about two or
three Inches long, looks to the eye like a thread of course Canvass, that
has been newly unwreath’d, it being all wav’d or bended to and fro, much
after that manner, but through the _Microscope_, it appears all perforated
from side to side, and Spongie, like a small kind of spongy Coral, which is
often found upon the _English_ shores; but though I cut it transversly, I
could not perceive that it had any pores that ran the long way of the hair:
the long hairs of Horses CC and D, seem _Cylindrical_ and somewhat pithy;
the Bristles of a Cat B, are conical and pithy: the Quils of Porcupines and
Hedghoggs, being cut transversly, have a whitish pith, in the manner of a
Starr, or Spur-rowel: Piggs-hair (A) is somewhat _triagonal_, and seems to
have neither pith nor pore: And other kinds of hair have quite a differing
structure and form.",15491,1600s

fertile, even when we dissent from his reasonings--nay, even in the

judgment implied in the discriminating remarks upon his philosophical
procedure made by Mr Mill himself--(pp. 271, 272). For example,
respecting Causality and the Freedom of the Will, we detect no want of
activity and fertility, though marked evidence of other
defects--especially the unconditional surrender of a powerful mind to
certain privileged inspirations, worshipped as 'necessities of thought.' While thus declaring how far we concur in the parallel here drawn of Sir

it is evident that many [great errors and] foolish opinions
concerning traditions had crept into the Church. Some thought that
human traditions were necessary services for meriting justification
[that without such human ordinances Christian holiness and faith are
of no avail before God; also that no one can be a Christian unless he
observe such traditions, although they are nothing but an outward
regulation]. And afterwards they disputed how it came to pass that
God was worshiped with such variety, as though, indeed, these
observances were acts of worship, and not rather outward and
political ordinances, pertaining in no respect to righteousness of
heart or the worship of God, which vary, according to the
circumstances, for certain probable reasons, sometimes in one way and

Than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen eagle? What is it? And to what shall I compare it? It has a glory, and nought else can share it:
The thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy,
Chacing away all worldliness and folly;
Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder,
Or the low rumblings earth's regions under;
And sometimes like a gentle whispering
Of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing
That breathes about us in the vacant air;
So that we look around with prying stare,
Perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial lymning,
And catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning;
To see the laurel wreath, on high suspended,
That is to crown our name when life is ended. Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice,
And from the heart up-springs, rejoice!",8209,1700s

not what should withhold me from presenting ye with a fit instance
wherein to show both that love of truth which ye eminently profess, and
that uprightness of your judgment which is not wont to be partial to
yourselves; by judging over again that Order which ye have ordained to
regulate printing:--that no book, pamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth
printed, unless the same be first approved and licensed by such, or at

preserves justly every man's copy to himself, or provides for the poor,
I touch not, only wish they be not made pretences to abuse and persecute
honest and painful men, who offend not in either of these particulars. But that other clause of licensing books, which we thought had died with
his brother quadragesimal and matrimonial when the prelates expired, I
shall now attend with such a homily, as shall lay before ye, first the
inventors of it to be those whom ye will be loath to own; next what is

begged that he would not by favoring an audacious mob, enable them to
complete the ruin both of the government and the city. To this Giovanni
replied, that he considered it the duty of a good and wise citizen to
avoid altering the institutions to which a city is accustomed; there
being nothing so injurious to the people as such a change; for many are
necessarily offended, and where there are several discontented, some
unpropitious event may be constantly apprehended. He said it appeared to
him that their resolution would have two exceedingly pernicious effects;
the one conferring honors on those who, having never possessed them,
esteemed them the less, and therefore had the less occasion to grieve
for their absence; the other taking them from those who being accustomed
to their possession would never be at rest till they were restored to
them. It would thus be evident that the injury done to one party, was
greater than the benefit they had conferred upon the other; so that
whoever was the author of the proposition, he would gain few friends and
make many enemies, and that the latter would be more resolutely bent

His sweet thoughtfulness had sent death to knock lightly at the door,
saying: “Not yet. You have still a little longer to be together. In a

riches of justification and salvation in Christ, so that I no longer
am in want of anything, except of faith to believe that this is so. For such a Father, then, who has overwhelmed me with these inestimable
riches of His, why should I not freely, cheerfully, and with my whole
heart, and from voluntary zeal, do all that I know will be pleasing to
Him and acceptable in His sight? I will therefore give myself as a sort
of Christ, to my neighbour, as Christ has given Himself to me; and will

Letter Third To Anne Boleyn


Although, my Mistress, it has not pleased you to remember the promise you
made me when I was last with you--that is, to hear good news from you, and
to have an answer to my last letter; yet it seems to me that it belongs to
a true servant (seeing that otherwise he can know nothing) to inquire the
health of his mistress, and to acquit myself of the duty of a true
servant, I send you this letter, beseeching you to apprise me of your
welfare, which I pray to God may continue as long as I desire mine own. And to cause you yet oftener to remember me, I send you, by the bearer of
this, a buck killed late last night by my own hand, hoping that when you
eat of it you may think of the hunter; and thus, for want of room, I must
end my letter, written by the hand of your servant, who very often wishes
for you instead of your brother. H. R.




Letter Fourth To Anne Boleyn


_MY MISTRESS & FRIEND_, my heart and I surrender ourselves into your
hands, beseeching you to hold us commended to your favour, and that by
absence your affection to us may not be lessened: for it were a great pity
to increase our pain, of which absence produces enough and more than I
could ever have thought could be felt, reminding us of a point in
astronomy which is this: the longer the days are, the more distant is the
sun, and nevertheless the hotter; so is it with our love, for by absence
we are kept a distance from one another, and yet it retains its fervour,
at least on my side; I hope the like on yours, assuring you that on my
part the pain of absence is already too great for me; and when I think of
the increase of that which I am forced to suffer, it would be almost
intolerable, but for the firm hope I have of your unchangeable affection
for me: and to remind you of this sometimes, and seeing that I cannot be
personally present with you, I now send you the nearest thing I can to
that, namely, my picture set in a bracelet, with the whole of the device,
which you already know, wishing myself in their place, if it should please
you.",32155,1400s

The northern boundary of the Raton section is placed somewhat
indefinitely at the northern limit of the area injected by igneous
dikes. The eastern boundary of the Raton section is at the eastern
margin of the lavas of Mesa de Maya and adjoining mesas, where
lava-capped outliers of Ogallala Formation are separated from the
Ogallala of the High Plains only by the canyon of Carrizo Creek. HIGH PLAINS

At the end of Ogallala deposition, some 5 million years ago, the Great
Plains, with the exception of the uplifted and the volcanic areas, was a
vast, gently sloping plain that extended from the mountain front
eastward to beyond the present Missouri River in some places. Regional
uplift of the western part of the continent forced the streams to cut
downward; land near the mountains was stripped away by the Missouri, the
Platte, the Arkansas, and the Pecos Rivers, and the eastern border of
the plains was gnawed away by lesser streams.",63396,1900s

two o’clock in the morning, I left her with her tea in full action, and
her idle Steam Tug lying by, deputing steam and smoke for the time being

he struck out into the wide Atlantic, highly extolling the behaviour of
these Emigrants, and the perfect order and propriety of all their social
arrangements. What is in store for the poor people on the shores of the
Great Salt Lake, what happy delusions they are labouring under now, on
what miserable blindness their eyes may be opened then, I do not pretend

scattering them, and, on the signal, Richards and Chapman charged
simultaneously. Some infantry at the head of the train met Richards with a volley,
costing him one man killed and several wounded and driving his charge
off at an angle into the middle of the train. The howitzer, in turn,

I have said that Walden has no visible inlet nor outlet, but it is on
the one hand distantly and indirectly related to Flint’s Pond, which is
more elevated, by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter, and
on the other directly and manifestly to Concord River, which is lower,
by a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological
period it may have flowed, and by a little digging, which God forbid,
it can be made to flow thither again. If by living thus reserved and
austere, like a hermit in the woods, so long, it has acquired such
wonderful purity, who would not regret that the comparatively impure
waters of Flint’s Pond should be mingled with it, or itself should ever
go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave? Flint’s, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our greatest lake and inland sea,

"After all,
these epicures must allow, that they are now and then out of
order; and that they cure themselves by taking evacuating
medicines and observing a strict diet. Whence it appears, that
their being out of order is owing to their eating too much, and
of things disagreeing with their stomachs. There are other old gluttons, who say, that it is necessary they
should eat and drink a great deal, to keep up their natural heat,
which is constantly diminishing, as they advance in years; and that
it is, therefore, necessary to eat heartily, and of such things as
please their palate, be they hot, cold, or temperate; and that, were
they to lead a sober life, it would be a short one. To these I
answer, that our kind mother, nature, in order that old men may live
still to a greater age, has contrived matters so, that they should
be able to subsist on little, as I do; for, large quantities of
food cannot be digested by old and feeble stomachs. Nor should
such persons be afraid of shortening their days by eating too
little, since when they happen to be indisposed, they recover by
lessening the quantity of their food; for it is a trifle they eat,
when confined to a regimen, by observing which they get rid of their
disorder.",30660,1400s

seemed to increase with her years. She was very badly educated, having
been always left with femmes de chambre. She is not very capricious, but
she is haughty and absolute in all her wishes. [Her pride led her into all sorts of follies. She once went through

"He who thus prays for grace and does not
rely upon God's mercy, treats Christ with dishonor, who, since He is
our High Priest, intercedes for us. Thus, therefore, prayer relies
upon God's mercy, when we believe that we are heard for the sake of
Christ the High Priest, as He Himself says, John 14, 13: Whatsoever
ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you. In My name,
He says, because without this High Priest we cannot approach the
Father. [All prudent men will see what follows from the opinion of the
adversaries. For if we shall believe that Christ has merited only
the _prima gratia_, as they call it, and that we afterwards merit
eternal life by our works, hearts or consciences will be pacified
neither at the hour of death, nor at any other time, nor can they
ever build upon certain ground; they are never certain that God is

the adversaries interpret that this refers to Levitical ceremonies

ceremonies, but of the whole Law. For he quotes afterward (7, 7)

are not Jewish ceremonies] would merit the remission of sins and
justification, there would also be no need of Christ and the promise,

"The experiences
and relationships upon which frigidity is based took place a long
time ago, often in very early childhood. They occasioned fear in the
child, fear of sexuality, of surrender to one’s sensual impulses, or
powerful guilt. Now, as one starts to move toward a resumption of one’s
sensuality, it is almost certain that these irrational, buried fears
will try to reassert themselves. In most cases it is not necessary to uncover the childhood incidents
upon which these fears were based. If one will insist on pursuing
the techniques for inner change I have described here, these fears
will finally become inoperative in the sexual area.",65130,1900s

not to submit nor ask Pardon: For that know you, Mamma, you never
could your self bring me to from my Childhood: Besides, I thought he
would be no more able to master his Passion for me now, than he had
been hitherto; and if he sent two Horses away with me, I concluded he
would send four to fetch me back. So, truly, I resolved to brazen it
out, and with all the Spirit I could muster up, I told Mrs. _Jewkes_

the aunt was any way concerned in it was matter of more uncertain

herself was acquainted. I therefore thought it almost indubitable that
she had been no less frank on the present occasion than was habitual

"(A.E., n. 1027.) It is said by some that he who sins against one commandment of the
Decalogue sins also against the rest, thus that he who is guilty of one
is guilty of all. It shall be told how far this is in harmony with the
truth. When a man transgresses one commandment, assuring himself that it
is not a sin, thus offending without fear of God, because he has thus
rejected the fear of God he does not fear to transgress the rest of the
commandments, although he may not do this in act.",14026,1600s

"That in the
history of the past there was not an instance, while Lucca was free, of
her having done an injury to the Florentines; and that if they had been
injured by her enslavers, as formerly by Castruccio, and now by the
present governor, the fault was not in the city, but in her tyrant. That if they could assail the latter without detriment to the people,
he should have less scruple, but as this was impossible, he could
not consent that a city which had been friendly to Florence should be
plundered of her wealth. However, as it was usual at present to pay
little or no regard either to equity or injustice, he would consider the
matter solely with reference to the advantage of Florence. He thought
that what could not easily be attended by pernicious consequences might
be esteemed useful, but he could not imagine how an enterprise should
be called advantageous in which the evils were certain and the utility
doubtful. The certain evils were the expenses with which it would be
attended; and these, he foresaw, would be sufficiently great to alarm
even a people that had long been in repose, much more one wearied, as
they were, by a tedious and expensive war.",2464,1400s
"Because he is such an enemy, that we can make no peace or
league with him. 2. Because they which yeeld unto the devill give themselves up into his
hands, as being overcome. 3. Because the courage of our minde to resist is a great part of
spirituall victory.",72645,1500s
"Opening her eyes, she saw the level valley floor without a break. She had not even noticed the instant when the car had shot over the
wash.

A strange breathlessness attacked her, and she attributed it to the
celerity with which she was being carried along. Pulling the hood down
over her face, she sank low in the seat. The whir of the car now seemed
to be a world-filling sound. Again the feeling of excitement, the
poignancy of emotional heights, the ever-present impending sense of
catastrophe became held in abeyance to the sheer intensity of physical
sensations.",1095,1800s
"Viewed from an ink standpoint they are of
vast interest. So extended in number are the ""anilines""
(they run into the thousands) that they include
every shade of black and all possible tints or hues of
the colors of the rainbow. The chronological history of such of these artificial
colors which appertain to ink or its manufacture is
important as locating the dates of their invention
and commercial use. The first discovery of ""aniline"" is credited to
Helot in 1750. In 1825 Faraday in rectifying naphtha
discovered benzole, which by the action of strong
nitric acid be converted into nitro-benzole; and this
latter, when agitated with water, acetic acid and iron
filings produced aniline.",1483,1800s

"Here he clearly shows
that he was keeping under his body, not to merit forgiveness of sins
by that discipline, but to have his body in subjection and fitted
for spiritual things, and for the discharge of duty according to
his calling. Therefore, we do not condemn fasting in itself, but the
traditions which prescribe certain days and certain meats, with peril of
conscience, as though such works were a necessary service. Nevertheless, very many traditions are kept on our part, which conduce
to good order in the Church, as the Order of Lessons in the Mass and
the chief holy-days. But, at the same time, men are warned that such
observances do not justify before God, and that in such things it should
not be made sin if they be omitted without offense. Such liberty in
human rites was not unknown to the Fathers.",275,1400s
"Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,
Amid the sun’s bright circle where thou sitst,
See far and wide: In at this gate none pass
The vigilance here placed, but such as come
Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour
No creature thence: If Spirit of other sort,
So minded, have o’er-leaped these earthly bounds
On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar. But if within the circuit of these walks,
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know. So promised he; and Uriel to his charge
Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised
Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,
Incredible how swift, had thither rolled
Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,
By shorter flight to the east, had left him there
Arraying with reflected purple and gold
The clouds that on his western throne attend. Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad;
Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests
Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
Silence was pleased: Now glowed the firmament
With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led
The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
Rising in clouded majesty, at length
Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,
And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw. When Adam thus to Eve.",26,1600s

"I have heard him do so laughingly, saying, among other
things, that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company,
and that when others would do as much as he had done, we should be
relieved of “the d——d niggers.”

The wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, living but a short distance from where I
used to live, murdered my wife’s cousin, a young girl between fifteen
and sixteen years of age, mangling her person in the most horrible
manner, breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick, so that the poor
girl expired in a few hours afterward. She was immediately buried, but
had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken
up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her
death by severe beating. The offence for which this girl was thus
murdered was this:—She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks’s
baby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She,
having lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the
crying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks.",23,1800s
"'Tis fear, 'tis hate, 'tis terror, 'tis aversion,
'Tis the cold debt of ostentatious duty,
Paid with insulting caution, to remind me
How much you tremble to offend a tyrant
So terrible as Douglas.--O, Elwina----
While duty measures the regard it owes
With scrupulous precision and nice justice,
Love never reasons, but profusely gives,
Gives, like a thoughtless prodigal, its all,
And trembles then, lest it has done too little. _Elw._ Indeed I'm most unhappy that my cares,
And my solicitude to please, offend. _Dou._ True tenderness is less solicitous,
Less prudent and more fond; the enamour'd heart,
Conscious it loves, and blest in being lov'd,
Reposes on the object it adores,
And trusts the passion it inspires and feels.--
Thou hast not learnt how terrible it is
To feed a hopeless flame.--But hear, Elwina,
Thou most obdurate, hear me.--

_Elw._ Say, my lord,
For your own lips shall vindicate my fame,
Since at the altar I became your wife,
Can malice charge me with an act, a word,
I ought to blush at? Have I not still liv'd
As open to the eye of observation,
As fearless innocence should ever live? I call attesting angels to be witness,
If in my open deed, or secret thought,
My conduct, or my heart, they've aught discern'd
Which did not emulate their purity.",30524,1700s

"“At last we came to the dwelling of our chief; a strong and spacious
house, built with stone in an island of the Nile, which lies, as I was
told, under the tropic. ‘Lady,’ said the Arab, ‘you shall rest after
your journey a few weeks in this place, where you are to consider
yourself as Sovereign. My occupation is war: I have therefore chosen
this obscure residence, from which I can issue unexpected, and to which I
can retire unpursued. You may now repose in security: here are few
pleasures, but here is no danger.’  He then led me into the inner
apartments, and seating me on the richest couch, bowed to the ground. “His women, who considered me as a rival, looked on me with malignity;
but being soon informed that I was a great lady detained only for my
ransom, they began to vie with each other in obsequiousness and
reverence.",652,1700s

"For he speaks
of the works of those who have been justified, who have already been
reconciled and accepted, and have obtained remission of sins. Wherefore the adversaries err when they infer that James teaches that
we merit remission of sins and grace by good works, and that by our
works we have access to God, without Christ as Propitiator. Part 8


Thirdly, James has spoken shortly before concerning regeneration,
namely, that it occurs through the Gospel. For thus he says 1, 18:
Of His own will begat He us with the Word of Truth, that we should be
a kind of first-fruits of His creatures. When he says that we have
been born again by the Gospel, he teaches that we have been born
again and justified by faith.",6744,1400s
"An elaborate history of the war had been
written by a Baron de Bazancourt, condemned as unfair and unreliable by
English statesmen, and severely handled in our reviews. So the wish was
felt everywhere for some record less ephemeral, which should render the
tale historically, and counteract Bazancourt’s misstatements. “I hear,”
wrote the Duke of Newcastle, “that Kinglake has undertaken the task. He
has a noble opportunity of producing a text-book for future history, but
to accomplish this it must be _stoically_ impartial.”

The beauty of their style, the merciless portraiture of the Second
Empire, the unparalleled diorama of the Alma fight, combined to gain for
these first four-and-twenty chapters an immediate vogue as emphatic and
as widely spread as that which saluted the opening of Macaulay’s
“History.”  None of the later volumes, though highly prized as battle
narratives, quite came up to these. The political and military
conclusions drawn provoked no small bitterness; his cousin, Mrs. Serjeant
Kinglake, used to say that she met sometimes with almost affronting
coldness in society at the time, under the impression that she was A. W.
Kinglake’s wife.",539,1800s

varnished town house, your pretty country house, and your box at that

own language agreeably enough because you know no other, you love all

"Most sugar mills burn bagasse as their
heat source to evaporate water out of the sugary juice squeezed from
the canes. At one time there was far more bagasse produced than the
mills needed to burn and bagasse often became an environmental
pollutant. Then, bagasse was available for nothing or next to
nothing. These days, larger, modern mills generate electricity with
bagasse and sell their surplus to the local power grid. Bagasse is
also used to make construction fiberboard for subwall and
insulation.",4342,1900s
"Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
    To slay herself, that should have slain her foe. “Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
In such relenting dew of lamentations,
But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part
To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,
That they will suffer these abominations,—
    Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,—
    By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased. “Now, by the Capitol that we adore,
And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained,
By heaven’s fair sun that breeds the fat earth’s store,
By all our country rights in Rome maintained,
And by chaste Lucrece’ soul that late complained
    Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,
    We will revenge the death of this true wife.”

This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,
And kissed the fatal knife, to end his vow;
And to his protestation urged the rest,
Who, wond’ring at him, did his words allow. Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow,
    And that deep vow which Brutus made before,
    He doth again repeat, and that they swore. When they had sworn to this advised doom,
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence,
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,

support us. Be not deceived about that antiquity of blood by which they
exalt themselves above us; for all men having had one common origin, are

be clothed in profane raiment, should dwell in profane places, should

had one thing in common: “They all died with the greatest possible
violence. Nowhere in the Pacific War had I seen such badly mangled
bodies. Many were cut squarely in half.”

Close combat was rough enough; on Iwo Jima the stress seemed endless
because for a long time the Marines had no secure “rear area” in which
to give shot-up troop units a respite. Kuribayashi’s gunners throughout
the Motoyama Plateau could still bracket the beaches and airfields. The enormous spigot mortar shells and rocket bombs still came tumbling

extraordinary celebrity. Since the year 1831, his name has been
familiarly known to the people of the United States; and the terror,

Missouri and Indiana, was only surpassed by the curiosity which pervaded

of that infinite Being, he went to his work appointed in the kitchen
(for he was cook to the society); there having first considered
severally the things his office required, and when and how each thing
was to be done, he spent all the intervals of his time, as well before
as after his work, in prayer. That when he began his business, he said to GOD, with a filial trust
in Him, ""O my GOD, since Thou art with me, and I must now, in
obedience to Thy commands, apply my mind to these outward things, I
beseech Thee to grant me the grace to continue in Thy Presence; and to
this end do Thou prosper me with Thy assistance, receive all my works,
and possess all my affections."" As he proceeded in his work, he continued his familiar conversation
with his Maker,--imploring His grace, and offering to Him all his
actions. When he had finished, he examined himself how he had discharged his
duty; if he found _well_, he returned thanks to GOD; if otherwise, he
asked pardon; and without being discouraged, he set his mind right
again, and continued his exercise of the _presence_ of GOD, as if he
had never deviated from it. ""Thus,"" said he, ""by rising after my
falls, and by frequently renewed acts of faith and love, I am come to
a state wherein it would be as difficult for me not to think of GOD as
it was at first to accustom myself to it.""",13871,1600s

all comes out.’

things fit in. The two best were about how some burglars broke into
a place in Holloway where they made preserved tongues and invalid
delicacies, and carried off a lot of them. And on another page there
was, ‘Mysterious deaths in Holloway.’

Oswald thought there was something in it, and so did Albert’s uncle when
we asked him, but the others thought not, so Oswald agreed to drop it. Besides, Holloway is a long way off. All the time we were talking about

his forces, he proceeded with the utmost speed to Verona. Observing his
approach, Niccolo thought he designed, according to the advice he had
received, to go to Vicenza, but finding him continue to draw near, and
taking the direction of San Felice, he prepared for its defense--though
too late; for the barricades were not completed; his men were dispersed
in quest of plunder, or extorting money from the inhabitants by way of
ransom; and he could not collect them in time to prevent the count's
troops from entering the fortress. They then descended into the city,
which they happily recovered, to Niccolo's disgrace, and with the loss
of great numbers of his men. He himself, with the marquis of Mantua,
first took refuge in the citadel, and thence escaping into the country,

they have not made proof of it experimentally, and have never tasted of
what efficacy it is. For it is not possible for any man to write well

some time tasted of its spirit, under the pressure of tribulation; while

And all the fair white flocks shall perish from the hills. The goat and antlered stag, the wolf and the fox,
The wild boar of the wood, and the chamois of the rocks,
And the strong and fearless bear, in the trodden dust shall lie,
And the dolphin of the sea, and the mighty whale, shall die. And realms shall be dissolved, and empires be no more,
And they shall bow to death, who ruled from shore to shore;
And the great globe itself, (so the holy writings tell,)
With the rolling firmament, where the starry armies dwell,
Shall melt with fervent heat--they shall all pass away,
Except the love of God, which shall live and last for aye. (* sic)

His steady hand the straightest furrow made;

For now he journeys to his grave in pain;
The rich disdain him; nay the poor disdain:
Alternate masters now their slave command,
Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand,
And, when his age attempts its task in vain,
With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain. Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,
His winter charge, beneath the hillock weep;
Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow
O'er his white locks and bury them in snow,
When, rous'd by rage and muttering in the morn,
He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn:  -

At once from life and life's long labour free? Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,
Without the sorrows of a slow decay;
I, like yon withered leaf remain behind,
Nipt by the frost, and shivering in the wind;
There it abides till younger buds come on
As I, now all my fellow-swains are gone,
Then from the rising generation thrust,
It falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust. ""These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,
Are others' gain, but killing cares to me;
To me the children of my youth are lords,
Cool in their looks, but hasty in their words:
Wants of their own demand their care; and who
Feels his own want and succours others too? A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,
None need my help, and none relieve my woe;
Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,
And men forget the wretch they would not aid.""",5203,1700s

Letter Thirteenth To Anne Boleyn


The approach of the time for which I have so long waited rejoices me so
much, that it seems almost to have come already. However, the entire
accomplishment cannot be till the two persons meet, which meeting is more
desired by me than anything in this world; for what joy can be greater
upon earth than to have the company of her who is dearest to me, knowing
likewise that she does the same on her part, the thought of which gives me
the greatest pleasure. Judge what an effect the presence of that person must have on me, whose
absence has grieved my heart more than either words or writing can
express, and which nothing can cure, but that begging you, my mistress, to
tell your father from me, that I desire him to hasten the time appointed
by two days, that he may be at court before the old term, or, at farthest,
on the day prefixed; for otherwise I shall think he will not do the
lover's turn, as he said he would, nor answer my expectation. No more at present for lack of time, hoping shortly that by word of mouth
I shall tell you the rest of the sufferings endured by me from your
absence. Written by the hand of the secretary, who wishes himself at this moment

dreadful familiarity with it all, her fluency about things which Ann
Eliza half-guessed and quickly shuddered back from, seemed even more

"If it be also Objected that this Notion of mine,
concerning mixtion, though it may be allow'd, when Bodies already
Compounded are put to be mingl'd, yet it is not applicable to those
mixtions that are immediately made of the Elements, or Principles
themselves; I Answer in the first place, that I here Consider the
Nature of mixtion somewhat more Generally, then the Chymists, who yet
cannot deny that there are oftentimes Mixtures, and those very durable
ones, made of Bodies that are not Elementary. And in the next place,
that though it may be probably pretended that in those Mixtures that
are made immediately of the Bodies that are call'd Principles or
Elements, the mingl'd Ingredients may better retain their own Nature
in the Compounded Mass, and be more easily separated from thence; yet,
besides that it may be doubted, whether there be any such Primary
Bodies, I see not why the reason I alleadg'd, of the destructibility
of the Ingredients of Bodies in General, may not sometimes be
Applicable to Salt Sulphur or Mercury; 'till it be shewn upon what
account we are to believe them Priviledged. And however, (if you
please but to recall to mind, to what purpose I told you at First, I
meant to speak of Mistion at this Time) you will perhaps allow that
what I have hitherto Discoursed about it may not only give some Light
to the Nature of it in general (especially when I shall have an
Opportunity to Declare to you my thoughts on that subject more fully)
but may on some Occasions also be Serviceable to me in the Insuing
Part of this Discourse. But, to look back Now to that part of our Discourse, whence this
Excursion concerning Mistion has so long diverted us, though we there
Deduc'd, from the differing Substances obtained from a Plant nourished
only with Water, and from some other things, that it was not necessary
that nature should alwaies compound a Body at first of all such
differing bodies as the fire could afterwards make it afford; yet this
is not all that may be collected from those Experiments. For from
them there seems also Deducible something that Subverts an other
Foundation of the Chymical Doctrine.",22914,1600s

"From hence they set Sail to the Island of St.
_John_ with near upon One Hundred and Eighty Slaves, whom they had
bound, where they sold one half of them, and thence to _Hispaniola_,
where they dispos'd of the rest. Now when I taxed this Captain with
Wickedness and Treachery in the very Isle of St. _John_, he dismist me
with this Answer; _Forbear good Sir._  I had this in commission from
those who sent me hither, that I should surprize them by the spetious
pretense of Peace, whom I could not sieze by open Force, and in truth
this same Captain told me with his own Mouth, that in _Trinity-Isle_
alone, he had met with a Father and Mother in Civil usage, which he
uttered to his greater Confusion and the aggravation of his Sins. The
Monks of our Order of St. _Dominic_ on a certain time held a Consult
about sending one of their Fraternity into this Island, that by their
Preaching they might instruct them in the Christian Faith, and teach
them the way to be sav'd, of which they were wholly Ignorant. And to
this end they sent thither a Religious and Licentiate in Theologie, (or
Doctor in Divinity, as we term it among us) a Man Famous for his Vertue
and Holiness with a _Laic_ his Associate, to visit the Country,
converse with the Inhabitants, and find out the most convenient places
for the Erection of Monasteries. As soon as they were arriv'd

"It is true that the late Madame was extremely unhappy; she confided too
much in people who betrayed her: she was more to be pitied than blamed,
being connected with very wicked persons, about whom I could give some
particulars. Young, pretty and gay, she was surrounded by some of the
greatest coquettes in the world, the mistresses of her bitterest foes,
and who sought only to thrust her into some unfortunate situation and to
embroil her with Monsieur. Madame de Coetquen was the Chevalier de
Lorraine’s mistress, although Madame did not know it; and she contrived
that the Marechal de Turenne should become attached to her. Madame
having told the Marshal all her secrets respecting the negotiations with
England, he repeated them to his mistress, Madame de Coetquen, whom he

"Finally many great Tyrants who came out of the _Perusian_ Kingdoms by
the _Quitonians_ Travelled to the said new Kindgom of _Granada_ and
_Popayan_, and by _Carthagena_ and the _Urabae_, they directed their
course to _Calisium_, and several other Tyrants of _Carthagena_ assault
_Quito_, who joyn'd themselves in an intire Body and wholly depopulated
and laid waste that Region for the space of 600 miles and upward, with
the loss of a prodigious number of poor Souls; nor as yet do they treat
the small remnant of so great and innocent a people with more humanity
then formerly. I desire therefore that the Readers who have or shall peruse these
passages, would please seriously to consider whether or no, such
Barbarous, Cruel and Inhumane Acts as these do not transcend and exceed
all the impiety and tyrrany, which can enter into the thoughts or
imagination of Man, and whether these _Spaniards_ deserve not the name
of Devils. For which of these two things is more eligible or desirable
whether the _Indians_ should be delivered up to the Devils themselves
to be tormented or the _Spaniards_? That is still a question. Nor can I here omit one piece of Villany, (whether it ought to be
postpon'd or come behind the cruelty of Brute Animals, that I leave to

"We (though it were strange to obserue such auersnesse for Our
resoluing vpon such waighty reasons, that wherin Wee needed not to
bee measured by any other rule, but Our owne Princely will) yet were
contented to descend from Our owne Right, to alter Our resolution,
and to continue the Session for a fortnight more, wherein they might
perfite such publique Billes, as were esteemed of most importance: for
which purpose, We Our selfe came in person vnto the Higher house of
Parliament, and made offer thereof vnto them, which being in effect
as much as the Commons had formerly desired, was no sooner offered,
but yeelding thankes to Vs, the said Commons resolued the same day
directly, contrary to their former desire, to refuse it, and to
accept Our first Resolution of an adiournement; but attending Vs at
Greenwich, presented no grieuances: This inconstancie, as Wee passed
by with a gentle admonition; so for the matter of grieuances, aswell
of England, as Ireland, We promised to take them into Our owne care,
though not presented to Vs, and really performed the same so farre
forth, as time, and the aduice of Our Councell of each Kingdome could
enable Vs, as is witnessed by Our seuerall Proclamations, published
in both Realms, as likewise in granting at the same time those three
suites which were proponed vnto Vs by the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,
at the request, and in the name of both the Houses: But in conclusion
of the house of Commons making it their choise, Wee made a Recesse by
adiournement of the Parliament, the fourth day of Iune; Though indeed
We must doe them this right, that at the said Recesse, taking into
their serious consideration the present estate of Our children abroad,
and the generall afflicted estate of the true Professors of Religion
in forraine parts, they did with one vnanimous consent, in the name of
themselues, and the whole body of the Kingdome, make a most dutifull
and solemne protestation, that if Our pious Endeauours, by treatie to
procure their peace and safetie, should not take that good effect which
was desired, (in the treatie whereof, they humbly besought Vs, not to
suffer any long delay) then, vpon signification of Our pleasure in
Parliament, they would be ready, to the vttermost of their powers, both
with liues and fortunes to assist Vs; so as that by the diuine helpe
of Almightie God, We might be able to doe that by Our sword, which by
peaceable courses should not be effected. But during the time of this long Recesse, hauing to Our great charges
mediated with the Emperour, by the meanes of Our Embassadour, the
Lord =DIGBIE=, and hauing found those hopes to fayle, which We had to
preuaile by treaty, Wee in confidence of the Assistance of Our people,
thus freely promised and protested in Parliament, did instantly shorten
the time of the Recesse, (which We had before appointed to continue
vntill the eighth day of February,) and did reassemble Our Parliament,
the twentieth day of Nouember last, and made knowen vnto them the true
state and necessity of Our Childrens affayres, declaring Our resolution
vnto them, of taking vpon Vs the defence of Our Childrens patrimony,
by way of Armes, since We could not compasse it by an amicable treaty;
and therefore expected the fruit of that their declaration, whereby We
were inuited vnto this course: wherein, howbeit We are well satisfied
of the good inclination of the most part of Our House of Commons,
testified by their ready assent to the speedy payment of a Subsidie,
newly to bee granted, yet vpon this occasion some particular members
of that House tooke such inordinate liberty, not only to treat of Our
high Prerogatiues, and of sundry things, that without Our speciall
direction were no fit subiects to be treated of in Parliament; but
also to speake with lesse respect of forraigne Princes, Our Allies,
then were fit for any Subiect to doe of anoynted Kings, though in
enmity and hostility with Vs. And when, vpon this occasion, Wee vsed
some reprehension towardes those miscarriages, requiring them not
to proceede but in such things as were within the capacity of that
House, according to the continuall custome of Our Predecessors, then
by the meanes of some euil affected and discontented persons, such
heat and distemper was raysed in the House, that albeit themselues
had sued vnto Vs for a Session, and for a generall Pardon, vnto both
which at their earnest suit We assented, yet after this fire kindled,
they reiected both, and setting apart all businesses of consequence &
waight (notwithstanding Our admonition and earnest pressing them to
goe on) they either sate as silent, or spent the time in disputing of
Priuiledges, descanting vpon the words and syllables of Our Letters
& messages, which for better cleering of trueth, and satisfaction of
all men, We are about to publish in Print, so soone as possibly We
can. And although in Our Answere to their petition, Wee gaue them full
assurance that Wee would be as carefull of the preseruation of their
Priuiledges, as of Our owne Royall Prerogatiue; and in Our explanation
after sent vnto them by Our Letters, written to Our Secretary, We
told them that Wee neuer meant to denie them any lawful priuiledges
that euer that House enioyed in Our predecessours times; and that
whatsoeuer priuiledges or liberties they enioyed by any Law or Statute,
should euer bee inuiolably preserued by Vs; and We hoped Our posterity
would imitate Our footsteps therein; and whatsoeuer priuiledges they
enioyed by long custome, and vncontrolled and lawful Presidents, We
would likewise be as carefull to preserue them, and transmit the care
therof to Our posterity, confessing Our selues in iustice to be bound
to maintaine them in their Rights, and in grace, that We were rather
minded to increase, then infringe any of them, if they should so
deserue at Our hands, which might satisfie any reasonable man, that
We were farre from violating their priuiledges. And although by Our
Letters written to their Speaker, Wee aduised them to proceede, and
make this a Session, to the end, that Our good & louing subiects might
haue some taste, aswell of Our grace and goodnes towards them, by Our
free pardon and good Lawes to bee passed, as they had both by the great
and vnusuall examples of Iustice since this meeting, and the so many
eases and comforts giuen vnto them by Proclamation. And although We had
giuen order for the Pardon to goe on, and that in a more gracious and
liberall manner then hath passed in may yeeres before, and signified
Our willingnesse, that rather then time should bee misspent, they
might lay aside the thought of the Subsidie, and goe on with an Act
for continuance of Statutes, and the generall Pardon; yet all this
preuailed not to satisfie them, either for their pretended Priuiledges,
or to perswade them to proceed with Bils for the good of themselues,
and those that sent them.",45773,1500s

living or my grey hairs with any of those young men, even of the
best constitution, who give way to their appetites; knowing, as I

"Then, too, the custom had a particular purpose: Because they were
foreigners, not Israelites, it is apparent that their father wished
to distinguish them by certain marks from their countrymen, so that
they might not relapse into the impiety of their countrymen. He
wished by these marks to admonish them of the [fear of God, the]
doctrine of faith and immortality. Such an end is lawful. But for

"One Day, being the _Festival_
of the Circumcision of the Prince of _Boldania_, I saw an ingenious
Fellow of a Mountebank climb to the Top of it, and come down safe. The same Attempt was immediately made by another, who made a Shift
to reach the Top of it, but the Height so dazzled and confounded him,
that, despairing of getting down without Hurt, he threw himself, with
all his Might, as far as he could from the _Colossus_, to avoid the
Danger of being dash’d to pieces upon the Foundation; so that falling
down right upon his Feet, he stuck deep in the Earth, and dy’d upon the
Spot. CHAP. XIII. _Of some other Columns in the_ Hippodrom.",53083,1400s
"What bothered him was the head. There really wasn't any, only
a mount for two froglike eyes, no space for a brain. Where the neck
should have been clung a small blob of waste. But he had difficulty in
pulling it off, and when he did he saw it was part of the design, an
auxiliary creature bloated like a woodtick, a bladder and a fang-ringed
mouth, nothing more than a toy parasite. Repressing a shudder he fitted the toy back together and dropped it in
his pocket.",64009,1900s
"Twelve deputies, impelled by attachment to the
King's person, ranged themselves near him at the commencement of the
insurrection; but the deputation from the Assembly did not reach the
Tuileries until six in the evening; all the doors of the apartments were
broken. The Queen pointed out to the deputies the state of the King's
palace, and the disgraceful manner in which his asylum had been violated
under the very eyes of the Assembly; she saw that Merlin de Thionville was
so much affected as to shed tears while she spoke. ""You weep, M. Merlin,"" said she to him, ""at seeing the King and his family
so cruelly treated by a people whom he always wished to make happy."" ""True, Madame,"" replied Merlin; ""I weep for the misfortunes of a beautiful
and feeling woman, the mother of a family; but do not mistake, not one of
my tears falls for either King or Queen; I hate kings and queens,--it is
my religion."" The Queen could not appreciate this madness, and saw all that was to be
apprehended by persons who evinced it.",3889,1700s
"We waste
time, deliberating about punishment for some of our neighbors who are
perhaps weaker, but certainly no more frightened than the rest of us. If
we lock them up in prison somebody has to watch out for them, and the
whole community is deprived of their useful labor. ""Why don't we just let them go?"" A gasp of surprise came from the spectators, but a slow illumination
seemed to light the face of Judge Rankin. His eyes moved from Ken to the
accused men and then to the audience.",33660,1900s
"The women commonly go into the
woods with bows and arrows in search of game, while the men are
chiefly occupied in fishing. I can say nothing respecting their
government, except that it did not seem any way strict or rigorous. When the king appeared in public, he was usually attended by many
couples, or men walking hand in hand, two and two together. On the
first morning of our arrival, he was seen in this manner coming out of
a wood, and noticing one of my officers cutting down a tree, whom
he judged to be better than ordinary, by having silver lace on his
waistcoat, be shewed both his authority and civility at the same time,
by ordering one of his attendants to take the axe and work in his
stead. One day while we were there, a prodigious flat fish was seen basking
in the sun on the surface of the water near the shore, on which twelve
Indians swam off and surrounded him.",15376,1700s

"To which promises he had
readily and voluntarily condescended, to my own certain knowledge, and
so by this means, the King would have received the Annual Revenue of
Three Millions of _Spanish_ Crowns, and upward, there being at that
very time in that Island Fifty Cities more ample and spacious than
_Sevil_ it self in _Spain_. But what returns by way of Remuneration and Reward did they make this
so Clement and Benign Monarch, can you imagine, no other but this? They put the greatest Indignity upon him imaginable in the person of
his Consort who was violated by a _Spanish_ Captain altogether unworthy
of the Name of Christian. He might indeed probably expect to meet with
a convenient time and opportunity of revenging this Ingominy so
unjuriously thrown upon him by preparing Military Forces to attaque
him, but he rather chose to abscond in the Province _De los Ciquayos_
(wherein a Puissant Vassal and subject of his Ruled) devested of his
Estate and Kingdom, and there live and dye an exile. But the
_Spaniards_ receiving certain information, that he had absented
himself, connived no longer at his Concealment but raised War against
him, who had received them with so great humanity and kindness, and
having first laid waste and desolate the whole Region, at last found,
and took him Prisoner, who being bound in Fetters was convey'd on board
of a ship in order to his transfretation to _Castile,_ as a Captive:
but the Vessel perished in the Voyage, wherewith many _Spaniards_ were
also lost, as well as a great weight of Gold, among which there was a
prodigious Ingot of Gold, resembling a large Loaf of Bread, weighing
3600 Crowns; Thus it pleased God to revenge their enormous impieties.",20321,1400s
"That we should have come to think it natural and proper for a young wife
and mother to pass her mornings at golf, lunching at the club-house to
""save time,"" returning home only for a hurried change of toilet to start
again on a bicycle or for a round of calls, an occupation that will leave
her just the half-hour necessary to slip into a dinner gown, and then for
her to pass the evening in dancing or at the card-table, shows, when one
takes the time to think of it, how unconsciously we have changed, and
(with all apologies to the gay hostesses and graceful athletes of to-day)
not for the better. It is just in the subtle quality of charm that the women of the last ten
years have fallen away from their elder sisters. They have been carried
along by a love of sport, and by the set of fashion's tide, not stopping
to ask themselves whither they are floating. They do not realize all the
importance of their acts nor the true meaning of their metamorphosis. The dear creatures should be content, for they have at last escaped from
the bondage of ages, have broken their chains, and vaulted over their
prison walls.",379,1800s
"These are the particulars which it has been given me to
know respecting the spirits and inhabitants of the earth Mercury. THE EARTH OR PLANET JUPITER, AND ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS. 46. It has been given me to have longer intercourse with the spirits
and angels of the planet Jupiter than with the spirits and angels
from the other planets; and I can therefore relate more particulars
respecting their state of life and respecting that of the inhabitants
of that planet. That those spirits were from that planet, was evident
from many circumstances, and was also declared from heaven.",16044,1600s
"He had no inclination to destroy a perfectly good,
tax-paying planet if he could whip its inhabitants into line by other
means. He ended the conference by stating his intention to ride in the
artificial forest. He enjoyed the glances of relief among the
generals--especially the older and more brittle ones--when he gave
them leave to resume their military duties instead of attending him. A few hours later, Wilkins found Vyrtl and a small retinue resting
beside a pool at the edge of the forest. ""The rebel envoy has arrived, Sire,"" he reported.",32637,1900s
"This indeed must necessarily follow; since, as
Socrates in Plato justly observes, ""it is not lawful for the pure to be
touched by the impure;"" and the multitude are neither purified from the
defilements of vice, nor the darkness of twofold ignorance. Hence, while
they are thus doubly impure, it is as impossible for them to perceive the
splendors of truth, as for an eye buried in mire to survey the light
of day. The depth of this philosophy then does not appear to have been perfectly
penetrated except by the immediate disciples of Plato, for more than five
hundred years after its first propagation. For though Crantor, Atticus,
Albinus, Galen and Plutarch, were men of great genius, and made no common
proficiency in Philosophic attainments, yet they appear not to have
developed the profundity of Plato's conceptions; they withdrew not the
veil which covers his secret meaning, like the curtains which guarded the
adytum of temples from the profane eye; and they saw not that all behind
the veil is luminous, and that there divine spectacles[17] every where
present themselves to the view. This task was reserved for men who were
born indeed in a baser age, but, who being allotted a nature similar to
their leader, were the true interpreters of his mystic speculations.",10214,1700s

"To these I answer, that what
they say is impossible in the nature of things, because it is
impossible that every man, who comes into the world, should not
bring with him a hot, a cold, or a temperate constitution; and
that hot foods should agree with hot constitutions, cold with
cold ones, and things that are not of a temperate nature, with
temperate ones, is likewise impossible in nature. After all,
these epicures must allow, that they are now and then out of
order; and that they cure themselves by taking evacuating
medicines and observing a strict diet. Whence it appears, that
their being out of order is owing to their eating too much, and
of things disagreeing with their stomachs. There are other old gluttons, who say, that it is necessary they
should eat and drink a great deal, to keep up their natural heat,
which is constantly diminishing, as they advance in years; and that
it is, therefore, necessary to eat heartily, and of such things as
please their palate, be they hot, cold, or temperate; and that, were
they to lead a sober life, it would be a short one. To these I
answer, that our kind mother, nature, in order that old men may live
still to a greater age, has contrived matters so, that they should
be able to subsist on little, as I do; for, large quantities of
food cannot be digested by old and feeble stomachs.",30660,1400s
"""We're both crazy,"" I said a little wildly, ""we're both stark, raving
nuts. Let's get out of here."" ""We are looking back almost five years into the past,"" Stoddard hissed. ""We are looking back five years into Germany, into a room in which
Hitler and Goering are talking over an approaching invasion of a country
called Austria. I might have believed I was crazy when I first found
this alone, but not now!""",32900,1900s
"“I am not afraid of men's misconstruction,” he said, in answer to
Leicester's remark, “since there is not--(permit me to undo the
collar)--a man within the Castle who does not expect very soon to see
persons of a rank far superior to that which, by your goodness, I now
hold, rendering the duties of the bedchamber to you, and accounting it
an honour.”

“It might, indeed, so have been”--said the Earl, with an involuntary
sigh; and then presently added, “My gown, Varney; I will look out on the
night. Is not the moon near to the full?”

“I think so, my lord, according to the calendar,” answered Varney. There was an abutting window, which opened on a small projecting balcony
of stone, battlemented as is usual in Gothic castles. The Earl undid the
lattice, and stepped out into the open air. The station he had chosen
commanded an extensive view of the lake and woodlands beyond, where the
bright moonlight rested on the clear blue waters and the distant masses
of oak and elm trees.",1606,1700s

he unfolded to them the solemn duty to which he had called them--to see
the bosom of their native land receive the remains of Sir William
Wallace. ""He gave to you your homes and your liberty!--grant, then, a grave, the
peace of the tomb to him, whom some amongst you repaid with treachery
and death!"" At these words a cry, as if they beheld their betrayed chief slain
before them, issued from every heart. The news had spread to the town, and with tears and lamentations a vast
crowd collected round the royal troop. Bruce ordered his bards to
raise the sad coronach, and the march commenced toward the open tent
that canopied the sacred remains.",6086,1700s
"BOOK V



CHAPTER I

The vicissitudes of empires--The state of Italy--The military factions
of Sforza and Braccio--The Bracceschi and the Sforzeschi attack the
pope, who is expelled by the Romans--War between the pope and the duke
of Milan--The Florentines and the Venetians assist the pope--Peace
between the pope and the duke of Milan--Tyranny practiced by the party
favorable to the Medici. It may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they
are subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a
state of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing
them to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their
greatest perfection, they soon begin to decline. In the same manner,
having been reduced by disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of
depression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend;
and thus from good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again
return to good. The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose;
repose, disorder; disorder, ruin; so from disorder order springs; from
order virtue, and from this, glory and good fortune. Hence, wise men
have observed, that the age of literary excellence is subsequent to that
of distinction in arms; and that in cities and provinces, great warriors
are produced before philosophers.",2464,1400s

result is that now, in middle age, I am the poor thing that I am. But
perhaps it is as well. Perhaps, too, it’s as well that Denis hasn’t
been permitted to flower into a little Nero, and that Ivor remains only
potentially a Caligula.",1999,1800s
"The devil having disfigured this beautiful image, it became necessary
that this same Word, whose breath had been breathed into us at our
creation, should come to restore it. It was necessary that it should be
He, because He is the image of the Father; and a defaced image cannot be
repaired by its own action, but by the action of him who seeks to
restore it. Our _action_ then should be, to _put ourselves_ into a
position to suffer the action of God, and to allow the Word to retrace
His image in us. An image, if it could move, would by its movement
prevent the sculptor's perfecting it. Every movement of our own hinders
the work of the Heavenly Sculptor, and produces false features.",24989,1600s
"Article XXVIII: Of Ecclesiastical Power. There has been great controversy concerning the Power of Bishops, in
which some have awkwardly confounded the power of the Church and the
power of the sword. And from this confusion very great wars and tumults
have resulted, while the Pontiffs, emboldened by the power of the Keys,
not only have instituted new services and burdened consciences with
reservation of cases and ruthless excommunications, but have also
undertaken to transfer the kingdoms of this world, and to take the
Empire from the Emperor. These wrongs have long since been rebuked in
the Church by learned and godly men. Therefore our teachers, for the
comforting of men's consciences, were constrained to show the difference
between the power of the Church and the power of the sword, and taught
that both of them, because of God's commandment, are to be held in
reverence and honor, as the chief blessings of God on earth.",275,1400s
"Their Friendship has been
fatal to all that ever depended upon it, as the Histories of the last
Times will evidently show; and though they pretended never so
cordially to espouse the Quarrel of their Confederates, yet they
seldom scrupled to abandon their Interests when it made never so
little for their Advantage to do it. _How this Dispatch by_ de Cros _was gained, or by whom_ (says Sir _W. T._ in his Memoirs, _p. 336._) _I will not pretend to determine._ And
a little lower: _The Account I met with at Court was, that these
Orders were agreed and dispatched one morning in an hours time, and in
the Dutchest of_ Portsmouth's _Chamber by the intervention and pursuit
of Monsieur_ Barillon. In this place Sir _W.",32659,1600s
"We consulted then as to
the best mode of preventing the suspicions which G---- M---- might
entertain of our relationship, when he found me older and of riper
manhood than he probably imagined. The only plan we could hit upon was
to assume in his presence an innocent and provincial air, and to
persuade him that it was my intention to enter the Church, and that
with that view I was obliged to go every day to the college. We also
determined that I should appear as awkward as I possibly could the
first time I was admitted to the honour of an introduction. ""He returned to town three or four days after, and at once conducted
Manon to the house which his steward had in the meantime prepared. She
immediately apprised Lescaut of her return, and he having informed me,

him physics and metaphysics. 13  Also those things which were
above and below the power of nature;

14  The powers also of the body,
its humours, and their effects. 15  Also the number of its members,

pomp, pursuant to their testamentary directions. These discourses, though written in Cornaro's old age, were penned
at different times, and published separately: The first, which he
wrote at the age of eighty-three, is intitled, A Treatise on a
Sober Life, in which he declares war against every kind of
intemperance; and his vigorous old age speaks in favour of his
precepts. The second treatise he composed at the age of eighty-six:
it contains farther encomiums on sobriety, and points out the means
of mending a bad constitution. He says, that he came into the
world with a choleric disposition, but that his temperate way of
life had enabled him to subdue it. The third, which he wrote at
the age of ninety-one, is intitled, An Earnest Exhortation to a
Sober Life; here he uses the strongest arguments to persuade
mankind to embrace a temperate life, as the means of attaining a
healthy and vigorous old age.",30660,1400s

This was the cause of the great final hunt that they fixed for
Christmas Day just two years after the scene at the grave of Little
Jim. It seemed as though all the Dogs in the country were brought
together. The three Huskies were there--the Factor considered them
essential--there were Danes and trailers and a rabble of farm Dogs and
nondescripts. They spent the morning beating all the woods east of St.
Boniface and had no success. But a telephone message came that the
trail they sought had been seen near the Assiniboine woods west of the
city, and an hour later the hunt was yelling on the hot scent of the
Winnipeg Wolf.",2284,1800s

"He has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jest of me for
using proverbs: but as they are the wisdom of whole nations and ages
collected into a small compass, I am not to be shamed out of sentences
that often contain more wisdom in them than the tedious harangues of most
of our parsons and moralists. Let him laugh at them, if he pleases: you
and I know better things, Mr. Belford--Though you have kept company with
a wolf, you have not learnt to howl of him. But nevertheless, you must let him know that I have written to you on
this subject. I am ashamed to say it; but he has ever treated me as if I
were a man of very common understanding; and would, perhaps, think never
the better of the best advice in the world for coming from me. Those,
Mr. Belford, who most love, are least set by.--But who would expect
velvet to be made out of a sow's ear?",10462,1600s
"how I envied your brother Edwin! He may be thankful he
was not the son of a Baron, compelled like me to go through the tiresome
drudgery of unmeaning ceremonies, and all the disgusting and nonsensical
forms which they tell me belong to a rank.--I am sure rank would be more
valuable and happier without them, and dignity far more pleasant to its
possessors, if they could divest themselves of pride. Commend be cordially to your parents.--Tell your sisters I love them as
a brother, and make my respects to De Clavering, De Willows, and the
honest Cambrian, to whom I hope one day to be of service. Sweet Roseline, think of me, dream of me, and love no one but me. My
father is very kind, very indulgent, and Albert very good, for he will
hear me talk of you for hours together; but neither the Baron nor Albert
can guess at the sufferings they inflict on me by this tedious absence
from you, to whom I am indebted for life, hope, and happiness.",37533,1700s
"For
’tis Muscular _Action_ and _Sensation_ that require It to be thus
determin’d, this way or that, which are now hardly any. And yet by the
arrival of Blood at the Brain, this _Juice_ will still be separated
there, fit to be derived into its Canals or Tubes. So that by this
means there will be a kind of _Accumulation_, or laying up in Store, of
_Spirits_ for the Offices and Requirements of _Waking_. Thus We may in short look upon the time of _Watching_, as the time of
Wearing out, or the Destruction of the Animal Fabrick; and the time of
_Sleep_, as that in which it is repaired and recruited; not only upon
the account of what We have just mentioned concerning the _Nervous
Liquor_, but also with respect to all the other Parts, as well Fluid as
Solid. For _Action_ does necessarily by Degrees impair the Springs and
Organs; and in _Motion_ something is continually abraded and struck off
from the Distractile Fibres, which cannot otherwise be restored than by
their being at rest from _Tension_.",53202,1600s
"It lies so much upon a Level, that you cannot perceive by
walking it, that it has the least Ascent; yet you may discover by the
Discernment of the Eye that it sensibly lengthens and widens itself
into a greater Breadth. It bounds the Sides of the third and the fifth
Valley, and the lowest Eminences of the fifth and sixth Hills. It is
full of Gardens and pleasant Meadows. Here the Soldiers sometimes act

"And therefore how little soever I

pour me like water upon the ground so instantly? Thou stayedst for the
first world, in Noah's time, one hundred and twenty years; thou stayedst
for a rebellious generation in the wilderness forty years, wilt thou
stay no minute for me? Wilt thou make thy process and thy decree, thy
citation and thy judgment, but one act? Thy summons, thy battle, thy
victory, thy triumph, all but one act; and lead me captive, nay, deliver
me captive to death, as soon as thou declarest me to be enemy, and so

a very capacious Cistern, built by _Clearchus_, who was _Prefect_ of

LONDON, October 30, 1767. MY DEAR FRIEND: I have now left Blackheath, till the next summer, if I
live till then; and am just able to write, which is all I can say, for I
am extremely weak, and have in a great measure lost the use of my legs; I
hope they will recover both flesh and strength, for at present they have
neither. I go to the Bath next week, in hopes of half repairs at most;
for those waters, I am sure, will not prove Medea's kettle, nor 'les eaux
de Jouvence' to me; however, I shall do as good courtiers do, and get
what I can, if I cannot get what I will. I send you no politics, for here
are neither politics nor ministers; Lord Chatham is quiet at Pynsent, in
Somersetshire, and his former subalterns do nothing, so that nothing is
done. Whatever places or preferments are disposed of, come evidently from

section of Joanna's life, to say that she fulfilled, to the height of
her promises, the restoration of the prostrate throne. France had become
a province of England, and for the ruin of both, if such a yoke could be
maintained. Dreadful pecuniary exhaustion caused the English energy to
droop; and that critical opening La Pucelle used with a corresponding
felicity of audacity and suddenness (that were in themselves portentous)
for introducing the wedge of French native resources, for rekindling the
national pride, and for planting the dauphin once more upon his feet. When Joanna appeared, he had been on the point of giving up the struggle
with the English, distressed as they were, and of flying to the south of
France. She taught him to blush for such abject counsels.",6359,1700s

amuse and inform you; for, at your age, one cannot see too many different
places and people; since at the age you are now of, I take it for granted
that you will not see them superficially, as you did when you first went
abroad. This whole matter then, summed up, amounts to no more than this--that you
will be here next winter, instead of this summer. Do not think that all I
have said is the consolation only of an old philosophical fellow, almost
insensible of pleasure or pain, offered to a young fellow who has quick
sensations of both. No, it is the rational philosophy taught me by
experience and knowledge of the world, and which I have practiced above
thirty years. I always made the best of the best, and never made bad worse by fretting;

been an actor, with more pleasure and less pain than most people.",3359,1600s

presented themselves once more before the duchess, in order to remind
her of the necessity of leniency towards the heretics until the arrival
of the king's answer from Spain, if she did not wish to drive the people
to extremities. ""If, however,"" they added, ""a contrary behavior should

their duty."" To this the regent replied, ""she hoped to be able to adopt such
measures as would render it impossible for disorders to ensue; but if,
nevertheless, they did occur, she could ascribe them to no one but the
confederates. She therefore earnestly admonished them on their part to
fulfil their engagements, but especially to receive no new members into
the league, to hold no more private assemblies, and generally not to
attempt any novel and unconstitutional measures.""",6778,1700s
"They rose from table, and the party now pressed round the new
bridegroom to wish him all joy, and to beg to be allowed to have their
ball. The bride threw her arms round him affectionately as she said,
""My first request, dearest, you cannot refuse; it will make us all so
happy; it is so long since I have been at a ball, and you have never
seen me dance--are you not anxious to know how I shall look?"" ""I never saw you in such high spirits,"" said Emilius; ""I will not
spoil your pleasure, do just as you please; only don't expect me to
jump and tumble about and make myself ridiculous."" ""If you are a bad dancer,"" said she, laughing, ""you may be sure you
will be left in peace."" She ran away to make the requisite alterations
in her dress for the ball.",38838,1700s

"But I, on the contrary, who knew, that the sober life I had led
for many years past, had so well united, harmonized, and disposed
my humours, as not to leave it in their power to ferment to such
a degree, refused to be either bled, or purged. I just caused my
leg and arm to be set, an suffered myself to be rubbed with some
oils, which they said were proper on the occasion. Thus, without
using any other kind of remedy, I recovered, as I thought I should,
without feeling the least alteration in myself, or any other bad
effects from the accident; a thing, which appeared miraculous even
in the eyes of the physicians. Hence we are to infer, that whoever
leads a sober and regular life, and commits no excess in his diet,
can suffer but very little from disorders of any other kind, or
external accidents. On the contrary, I conclude, especially from
the late trial I have had, that excesses in eating and drinking are
fatal.",30660,1400s

"XII. _Of the_ Colossus. There is yet standing, in the Middle of the _Hippodrom_, a _Colossus_

upon its _Basis_, ’twas cover’d with Plates of Brass, cramp’d together
with Iron, as appears not only by the Holes made in the Shaft, but
by those which still remain in the _Base_; where the Iron Pins were
fasten’d, and strengthen’d with melted Lead. ’Tis now despoil’d of its
outward beauteous Appearance; and discovers only the Workmanship of its

"As we advanced, however, we were cheered, notwithstanding the season,
by the bright tints of southern vegetation. The banks continue
invariably flat, but a succession of planless villas, sometimes merely
a residence, and sometimes surrounded by their sugar grounds and negro
huts, varied the scene. At no one point was there an inch of what
painters call a second distance; and for the length of one hundred and
twenty miles, from the Balize to New Orleans, and one hundred miles
above the town, the land is defended from the encroachments of the
river by a high embankment which is called the Levee; without which the
dwellings would speedily disappear, as the river is evidently higher
than the banks would be without it. When we arrived, there had been
constant rains, and of long continuance, and this appearance was,
therefore, unusually striking, giving to “this great natural feature”
the most unnatural appearance imaginable; and making evident, not only
that man had been busy there, but that even the mightiest works of
nature might be made to bear his impress; it recalled, literally,
Swift’s mock heroic,

“Nature must give way to art;”


yet, she was looking so mighty, and so unsubdued all the time, that I
could not help fancying she would some day take the matter into her own
hands again, and if so, farewell to New Orleans. It is easy to imagine the total want of beauty in such a landscape; but
yet the form and hue of the trees and plants, so new to us, added to
the long privation we had endured of all sights and sounds of land,
made even these swampy shores seem beautiful.",10345,1700s
"This year a part was proposed by the Right Honorable Aureus de Woolsack
in the tribe of Pecus, first commissioner of the Treasury, to the
Council of State, which soon after passed the ballot of the Senate
and the people, by which the lands of the public revenue, amounting
to £1,000,000, were equally divided into £5,000 lots, entered by their
names and parcels into a lot-book preserved in the Exchequer. And if
any orphan, being a maid, should cast her estate into the Exchequer for
£1,400, the Treasury was bound by the law to pay her quarterly £200 a
year, free from taxes, for her life, and to assign her a lot for her
security; if she married, her husband was neither to take out the
principal without her consent (acknowledged by herself to one of the
commissioners of the Treasury, who, according as he found it to be free,
or forced, was to allow or disallow of it), nor any other way engage
it than to her proper use. But if the principal were taken out, the
Treasury was not bound to repay any more of it than £1,000, nor might
that be repaid at any time, save within the first year of her marriage:
the like was to be done by a half or quarter lot respectively. This was found to be a great charity to the weaker sex, and as some say,
who are more skilful in the like affairs than myself, of good profit to
the commonwealth. Now began the native spleen of Oceana to be much purged, and men not to
affect sullenness and pedantism.",2801,1600s
"But was that all? The raid had followed significantly close upon the
heels of his entry into Chang Foo's. Larry the Bat began to move forward
again. He dared not follow the others, and, later on, when quiet was
restored, issue out into the street from any one of the various houses
in which he might temporarily have taken refuge. There was a chance in
that, a chance that the police might be more zealous than usual, even if
he particularly was not their game--and he could take no chance.",1218,1800s
"The war having terminated before the ""_Fulton the First_"" was entirely
completed, she was taken to the Navy Yard, Brooklyn, and moored on the
flats abreast of that station, where she remained, and was used as a
receiving-ship until the fourth of June, eighteen hundred and
twenty-nine, when she was blown up. The following letters from Commodore
Isaac Chauncey (then Commandant of the New York Navy Yard) to the
Honorable Secretary of the Navy, informing him of the distressing event,

U. S. NAVY YARD, NEW YORK,
_June 5th, 1829_. SIR:

It becomes my painful duty to report to you a most unfortunate
occurrence which took place yesterday, at about half past two o'clock,
P. M., in the accidental blowing up of the Receiving Ship Fulton, which
killed twenty-four men and a woman, and wounded nineteen; there are also
five missing. Amongst the killed I am sorry to number Lieutenant S. M.
Brackenridge, a very fine, promising officer, and amongst the wounded
are, Lieutenants Charles F. Platt, and A. M. Mull, and Sailing-Master
Clough, the former dangerously, and the two last severely; there are
also four Midshipmen severely wounded.",31179,1900s
"During the time that they
halted at Dirkee, the women brought them dates, fancifully strung on
rushes, in the shape of hearts, with much ingenuity, and a few pots
of honey and fat. They halted at Dirkee rather more than two days. So many of Boo
Khaloom's camels had fallen on the road, that, notwithstanding the
very peaceable professions which the travelling party held forth, a
marauding party was sent out to plunder some maherhies, and bring
them in; an excursion that was sanctioned by the sultan, who gave
them instructions as to the route they were to take. The former deeds
of the Arabs are, however, still in the memory of the Tibboos, and
they had therefore increased the distance between their huts and the
high road, by a timely striking of their tents. Nine camels, of the
maherhy species, were brought in, but not without a skirmish; and a
fresh party were despatched, which did not return that night.",12667,1700s

afterward cardinal. He was the first who began to show how far a pope
might go, and how much that which was previously regarded as sinful lost

sons, though he designated them by terms reflecting less scandal on
his character.",2464,1400s

"I still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the
Internet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic
science: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing

"However, whatever
might have been the original intention of this Collis, neither my uncle
nor my father ever heard more of him; but he published the letter in
Faulkner's newspaper, which was shortly afterwards made the vehicle of
a much more mysterious attack. The passage in that periodical to which
I allude, occurred about four years afterwards, and while the fatal
occurrence was still fresh in public recollection. It commenced by a
rambling preface, stating that 'a CERTAIN PERSON whom CERTAIN persons
thought to be dead, was not so, but living, and in full possession
of his memory, and moreover ready and able to make GREAT delinquents
tremble.' It then went on to describe the murder, without, however,
mentioning names; and in doing so, it entered into minute and
circumstantial particulars of which none but an EYE-WITNESS could
have been possessed, and by implications almost too unequivocal to be
regarded in the light of insinuation, to involve the 'TITLED GAMBLER' in
the guilt of the transaction. My father at once urged Sir Arthur to proceed against the paper in an
action of libel; but he would not hear of it, nor consent to my father's
taking any legal steps whatever in the matter.",510,1800s

according to custom, they were entertain'd like Coelestial Messengers,
with great Affection, Joy and Respect, as well as they could, for they
were ignorant of their Tongue, and so made use of signs, for the
present. It hapned that after the departure of that Vessel that
brought these Religious Men, another came into the Port, whose Crew
according to their Hellish Custom, fraudulently, and unknown to the
Religious brought away a Prince of that Province as Captive, who was
call'd _Alphonsus_, (for they are ambitious of a Christian Name,) and
forthwith desire without farther Information, that he would Baptize
him: But the said Lord _Alphonsus_ was deceitfully overperswaded to go
on board of them with his Wife and about Seventeen more, pretending
that they would give hime a Collation; which the Prince and they did,
for he was confident, that the Religious would by no means suffer himo
be abus'd, for he had no so much Confidence in the _Spaniards_; but as
soon as they were upon Deck, the perfidious Rogues, set Sail for
_Hispaniola_, where they were sold as Slaves. The whole Country being
extreamly discompos'd, and understanding that their Prince and Princess
were violently carried away, addressed themselves to these Religioso's,
who were in great danger of losing their Lives: But they being made to
understand this unjust Action, were extraordinarily afflicted, and 'tis
probable would have suffered Death, rather than permit the _Indians_ to
be so injuriously dealt with, which might prove an Obstruction to their
receiving of, and believing in God's Word. Yet the _Indians_ were
sedated by the promises of the Religious; for they told them, they
would send Letters by the first Ship that was bound for _Hispaniola_,
whereby they would procure the Restitution and Return of their Lord and
his Retinue. It pleased God to send a Ship thither forthwith, to the
greater confirming of the Governours Damnation, where in the Letters
they sent to the Religious of _Hispaniola_, Letters containing repeated
Exclamations and Protestations, and protest against such Actions, but
those that received them denyed them Justice, for that they were
partakers of that Prey, made of those _Indians_ so injustly and
impiously captivated.",20321,1400s

where they appointed eight leaders for their party, with officers, and
other regulations to ensure influence and respect; so that the city
possessed two governments, and was under the direction of two distinct
powers. These new leaders determined that Eight, elected from their
trades, should constantly reside in the palace with the Signory, and
that whatever the Signory should determine must be confirmed by them
before it became law. They took from Salvestro de' Medici and Michael
di Lando the whole of what their former decrees had granted them, and
distributed to many of their party offices and emoluments to enable them
to support their dignity. These resolutions being passed, to render them
valid they sent two of their body to the Signory, to insist on their
being confirmed by the Council, with an intimation, that if not granted
they would be vindicated by force. This deputation, with amazing

requires faith, and is used in vain without faith.] Now, forasmuch as the Mass is such a giving of the Sacrament, we hold
one communion every holy-day, and, if any desire the Sacrament, also on
other days, when it is given to such as ask for it. And this custom is
not new in the Church; for the Fathers before Gregory make no mention of
any private Mass, but of the common Mass [the Communion] they speak
very much. Chrysostom says that the priest stands daily at the altar,
inviting some to the Communion and keeping back others. And it appears
from the ancient Canons that some one celebrated the Mass from whom all

"The fifth and
thirteenth, however, which are not comprehended in the Vatican collection,
are supplied from Hearne's work. Of the seventeen letters of which the
series consists, eight are written in English and nine in French. They appear to have been written after Anne Boleyn had been sent away from
court, in consequence of reports injurious to her reputation, which had
begun to be publicly circulated. Her removal indeed was so abrupt that she
had resolved never to return. The king soon repented his harshness, and
strove to persuade her to come back; but it was a long time, and not
without great trouble, before he could induce her to comply.",32155,1400s

"Winter kept us warm, covering
  Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
  A little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee

  She screams--she cannot move for joy;
  She darts as with a torrent's force,
  She almost has o'erturned the horse,
  And fast she holds her idiot boy. And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud,
  Whether in cunning or in joy,
  I cannot tell; but while he laughs,
  Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs,
  To hear again her idiot boy. And now she's at the pony's tail,
  And now she's at the pony's head,
  On that side now, and now on this,
  And almost stifled with her bliss,
  A few sad tears does Betty shed. She kisses o'er and o'er again,
  Him whom she loves, her idiot boy,
  She's happy here, she's happy there.",8905,1700s
"My little friends trotted up,

“Dass ist unser Jesu,” said the elder, and the little one echoed “Unser
Jesu, unser Jesu!”

Then the vest was brought out and shown—why not, it was the Christchild’s
own?—and the pair trotted away again followed by the bright, patient
Sister. Presently everyone clattered out, and I was left alone at the
crib of Bethlehem, the gate of the Kingdom of Heaven. It was my family, my only family; but like the ever-widening circle on
the surface of a lake into which a stone has been flung, here, from this
great centre, spread the wonderful ever-widening relationship—the real
brotherhood of the world.",835,1800s

wanting to the legislature, and to the Court of Directors, if he was not
to receive the complaints of the inhabitants, when properly
authenticated, and to prefer them to the board for investigation, as the
only means by which these grievances can be redressed, and the Company
informed of the conduct of their servants."" To these sentiments Colonel Monson and Mr. Francis adhered. Mr. Hastings
thought it more safe, on principles similar to those assumed by Mr.
Barwell, to refuse to hear the charge; but he reserved his remarks on
this transaction, because they will be equally applicable to _many
others which in the course of this business are likely to be brought
before the board_. There appeared, therefore, to him a probability that
the charge about the corrupt bargain was no more than the commencement
of a whole class of such accusations; since he was of opinion (and what
is very extraordinary, previous to any examination) that the same
remarks would be applicable to several of those which were to follow. He
must suppose this class of charges very uniform, as well as very
extensive.",18161,1700s
"But to return to
what I was saying of Nitre; as Nature made this Salt-Petre out of the
once almost and inodorous Earth it was bred in, and did not find a
very stinking and corrosive Acid Liquor, and a sharp Alcalyzate Salt
to compound it of, though these be the Bodies into which the Fire
dissolves it; so it were not necessary that Nature should make up all
Metals and other Minerals of Pre-existent Salt, and Sulphur, and
Mercury, though such Bodies might by Fire be obtained from it. Which
one consideration duly weigh'd is very considerable in the present
controversy: And to this agree well the Relations of our two German
Chymists; for besides that it cannot be convincingly prov'd, it is not
so much as likely that so languid and moderate a heat as that within
the Mines, should carry up to so great a heat [Errata: height], though
in the forme of fumes, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; since we find in our
Distillations, that it requires a considerable Degree of Fire to raise
so much as to the height of one foot not only Salt, but even Mercury
it self, in close Vessels. And if it be objected, that it seems by the
stink that is sometimes observ'd when Lightening falls down here
below, that sulphureous steams may ascend very high without any
extraordinary Degree of heat; It may be answer'd, among other things,
that the Sulphur of Silver is by Chymists said to be a fixt Sulphur,
though not altogether so well Digested as that of Gold. But, proceeds _Carneades_, If it had not been to afford You some hints
concerning the Origine of Metals, I need not have deduc'd any thing
from these Observations; It not being necessary to the Validity of my
Argument that my Deductions from them should be irrefragable, because
my Adversaries the _Aristotelians_ and Vulgar Chymists do not, I
presume, know any better then I, _a priori_, of what ingredients
Nature compounds Metals and Minerals. For their Argument to prove that
those Bodies are made up of such Principles, is drawn _a posteriori_;
I mean from this, that upon the _Analysis_ of Mineral bodies they are
resolv'd into those differing substances.",22914,1600s

"But it would be foolish to consider in such a
sentence only the words: Relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless. For he says in the beginning: Cease to do evil, where he censures
impiety of heart and requires faith. Neither does the prophet say
that through the works: Relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
they can merit the remission of sins _ex opere operato_, but he
commands such works as are necessary in the new life. Yet, in the
mean time, he means that remission of sins is received by faith, and
accordingly the promise is added. Thus we must understand all
similar passages.",6744,1400s

he was presently called off by the captain of the Zeppelin, who sent
him with a note to the officer in charge of the Anglo-American Power
Company, for the field telephone had still to be adjusted. Bert received
his instructions in German, whose meaning he guessed, and saluted and
took the note, not caring to betray his ignorance of the language. He
started off with a bright air of knowing his way and turned a corner or

"We should not acquire fellow-citizens, but partakers of our
bondage, who would serve to sink us still deeper in ignominy. And if
your conduct were in every respect upright, your demeanor amiable, and
your judgments equitable, all these would be insufficient to make you
beloved. If you imagine otherwise, you deceive yourself; for, to one
accustomed to the enjoyment of liberty, the slightest chains feel
heavy, and every tie upon his free soul oppresses him. Besides, it is
impossible to find a violent people associated with a good prince, for
of necessity they must soon become alike, or their difference produce
the ruin of one of them. You may, therefore, be assured, that you
will either have to hold this city by force, to effect which, guards,
castles, and external aid have oft been found insufficient, or be
content with the authority we have conferred; and this we would advise,
reminding you that no dominion can be durable to which the governed do
not consent; and we have no wish to lead you, blinded by ambition, to
such a point that, unable either to stand or advance, you must, to the
great injury of both, of necessity fall.""",2464,1400s

"'I should be too happy if I had lost both my reason
and my life,' cried he; 'Madam de Tournon was false to me, and I am
informed of her unfaithfulness and treachery the very day after I was
informed of her death; I am informed of it at a time when my soul is
filled with the most tender love, and pierced with the sharpest grief
that ever was; at a time when the idea of her in my heart, is that of
the most perfect woman who ever lived, and the most perfect with
respect to me; I find I am mistaken, and that she does not deserve to
be lamented by me; nevertheless I have the same concern for her death,
as if she had been true to me, and I have the same sensibility of her
falsehood, as if she were yet living; had I heard of her falsehood
before her death, jealousy, anger, and rage would have possessed me,
and in some measure hardened me against the grief for her loss; but now
my condition is such, that I am incapable of receiving comfort, and yet
know not how to hate her.' ""You may judge of the surprise I was in at what Sancerre told me; I
asked him how he came by the knowledge of it, and he told me that the
minute I went away from him, Etouteville, who is his intimate friend,
but who nevertheless knew nothing of his love for Madam de Tournon,
came to see him; that as soon as he was sat down, he fell a-weeping,
and asked his pardon for having concealed from him what he was going to
tell him, that he begged him to have compassion of him, that he was
come to open his heart to him, and that he was the person in the world
the most afflicted for the death of Madam de Tournon. ""'That name,' said Sancerre, 'so astonished me, that though my first
intention was to tell him I was more afflicted than he, I had not the
power to speak: he continued to inform me, that he had been in love
with her six months, that he was always desirous to let me know it, but
she had expressly forbid him; and in so authoritative a manner, that he
durst not disobey her; that he gained her in a manner as soon as he
courted her, that they concealed their mutual passion for each other
from the whole world, that he never visited her publicly, that he had
the pleasure to remove her sorrow for her husband's death, and that
lastly he was to have married her at the very juncture in which she
died; but that this marriage, which was an effect of love, would have
appeared in her an effect of duty and obedience, she having prevailed
upon her father to lay his commands on her to marry him, in order to
avoid the appearance of too great an alteration in her conduct, which
had seemed so averse to a second marriage.' ""'While Etouteville was speaking to me,' said Sancerre, 'I believed all
he said, because I found so much probability in it, and because the
time when he told me his passion for Madam de Tournon commenced, is
precisely the same with that when she appeared changed towards me; but
the next morning I thought him a liar, or at least an enthusiast, and
was upon the point of telling him so. Afterwards I came into an
inclination of clearing up the matter, and proposed several questions,
and laid my doubts before him, in a word, I proceeded so far to
convince myself of my misfortune, that he asked me if I knew Madam de
Tournon's handwriting, and with that threw upon my bed four letters of
hers and her picture; my brother came in that minute; Etouteville's
face was so full of tears, that he was forced to withdraw to avoid
being observed, and said he would come again in the evening to fetch
what he left with me; and as for me, I sent my brother away under
pretence of being indisposed, so impatient was I to see the letters he

you my cap and bell along with it, if I make not this matter so plain
that _Dolly_ herself should understand it as well as _Malbranch._——When
_Dolly_ has indited her epistle to _Robin_, and has thrust her arm into
the bottom of her pocket hanging by her right side;—take that
opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception
can, by nothing in this world, be so aptly typified and explained as by

long for her thimble, till the wax is over hardened, it will not
receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont

the point, for although the buildings are neither beautiful nor in
good style, but only very large and magnificent, yet they are none
the less worthy of some consideration. In the time of Lapo, and of Arnolfo his son, many buildings of
importance were erected in Italy and outside, of which I have not
been able to find the names of the architects. Among these are the
abbey of Monreale in Sicily, the Piscopio of Naples, the Certosa of
Pavia, the Duomo of Milan, S. Pietro and S. Petrodio of Bologna, and
many others, which may be seen in all parts of Italy, erected at
incredible cost. I have seen and examined all these buildings, as
well as many sculptures of these times, particularly at Ravenna, but
I have never found any memorial of the masters, and frequently not
even the date when they were erected, so that I cannot but marvel at

"Alarmed and unhappy, Lady Percy wearied her daughter with inquiries as
to the cause of this inauspicious change; but in vain. Helen denied that
any alteration had taken place in her feelings; and declared that the
new and serious tone of her character arose naturally from her advance
in life, and from the duties devolving upon her as a wife and mother. “Be satisfied, dear madam,” said she, “that I am still a happy and
adoring wife. You well know that my affections were not won by an
outward show of splendour and gay accomplishments, nor by the common
attraction of an idle gallantry. It was on Greville's high reputation
for just and honourable principles, and on his manly and noble nature,
that my love was founded, and these will never change;--and if, at
times, unpleasant circumstances should arise, into which my sex and age
unfit me to inquire to throw a cloud over his features, or a transient
peevishness into his humour, it would ill become me--in short,”
 continued she in a trembling voice, and throwing her arms around Lady
Percy's neck, to conceal her tears, “in short, dear Madam, you must
remember that dearly, tenderly, dutifully, as Helen loves her mother,
the wife of Greville can have no complaints to make to the Countess of
Percy*.”

"There were few marks of modern improvement. The environs of
the place intimated neither the solitude of decay nor the bustle of
novelty; the houses were old, but in good repair; and the beautiful
little river murmured freely on its way to the left of the town, neither
restrained by a dam nor bordered by a towing-path. Upon a gentle eminence, nearly a mile to the southward of the town, were
seen, amongst many venerable oaks and tangled thickets, the turrets of
a castle as old as the walls of York and Lancaster, but which seemed to
have received important alterations during the age of Elizabeth and
her successor, It had not been a place of great size; but whatever
accommodation it formerly afforded was, it must be supposed, still to
be obtained within its walls. At least, such was the inference which
General Browne drew from observing the smoke arise merrily from several
of the ancient wreathed and carved chimney-stalks. The wall of the park

manner, confident and light-hearted in spirit. He had seemed too young

enjoyment of outdoor games and other healthful sports robbed him of a
certain dignity in their eyes. Some of the women of the congregation had
been inclined to side with the deacons, for it hurt their vanity that
the pastor found so many other interests when he might have been sitting

"They appear to have been written after Anne Boleyn had been sent away from
court, in consequence of reports injurious to her reputation, which had
begun to be publicly circulated. Her removal indeed was so abrupt that she
had resolved never to return. The king soon repented his harshness, and
strove to persuade her to come back; but it was a long time, and not
without great trouble, before he could induce her to comply. Her
retirement did not take place before the month of May, 1528; this is
proved by a letter from Fox, Bishop of Hereford, to Gardiner, Bishop of
Winchester, dated the 4th of May, in that year, in which the writer, who
had just returned from Rome, whither he had been sent to negotiate the
king's divorce, gives an account of his landing at Sandwich on the 2nd,
of his arrival on the same night at Greenwich, where the king then was,
and of the order he received from him to go to the apartments of Anne
Boleyn, which were in the Tiltyard, and inform her how anxious he had been
to hasten the arrival of the legate, and how much he was rejoiced by it. This letter, formerly in the collection of Harley, Earl of Oxford, is now

his own advantage, and not for the glory of God. And thus he is not a
priest, but a profane person, whose prayers are turned into sin, nor
does he ever appear in the presence of God, because God does not hear
sinners. Who then can comprehend the loftiness of that Christian dignity which,
by its royal power, rules over all things, even over death, life, and
sin, and, by its priestly glory, is all-powerful with God, since God
does what He Himself seeks and wishes, as it is written, ""He will fulfil
the desire of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and will
save them""? (Psalm cxlv. 19).",1911,1400s
"DEAR BOY: By Mr. Harte’s letter to me of the 18th July N. S., which I
received by the last post, I am at length informed of the particulars
both of your past distemper, and of your future motions. As to the
former, I am now convinced, and so is Dr. Shaw, that your lungs were only
symptomatically affected; and that the rheumatic tendency is what you are
chiefly now to guard against, but (for greater security) with due
attention still to your lungs, as if they had been, and still were, a
little affected. In either case, a cooling, pectoral regimen is equally
good. By cooling, I mean cooling in its consequences, not cold to the
palate; for nothing is more dangerous than very cold liquors, at the very
time that one longs for them the most; which is, when one is very hot. Fruit, when full ripe, is very wholesome; but then it must be within
certain bounds as to quantity; for I have known many of my countrymen die
of bloody-fluxes, by indulging in too great a quantity of fruit, in those
countries where, from the goodness and ripeness of it, they thought it
could do them no harm.",3361,1600s

found Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,

slightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her

"As a pretence to break with the Huguenots, a report was spread abroad
that the Catholics were dissatisfied with the Peace of Sens, and thought

succeeded, and produced all that discontent amongst the Catholics
intended by it. A league was formed: in the provinces and great cities,
which was joined by numbers of the Catholics. M. de Guise was named as
the head of all. This was well known to the King, who pretended to be
ignorant of what was going forward, though nothing else was talked of at
Court.",3841,1500s
"The third stage seems to have owed its origin to orators constantly
dwelling upon the excellences of the saints in the panegyrics delivered
over their remains, representing their constancy and Christian virtues
as superhuman and divine, and as having conferred lasting benefits on
the Church. By these benefits at first was meant the comfort and
encouragement of their good example, and the honour procured to the
religion of the cross by their bearing witness to its truth even unto
death; but in process of time the habit grew of attaching a sort of
mysterious efficacy to their merits; hence this third gradation in
religious worship, namely, prayers to God that ""He would hear his
suppliants, and grant their requests for the sake of his martyred
servant, and by the efficacy of that martyr's merits."" 4th. Hitherto, unauthorized and objectionable as the two last forms of
prayer are, still the petitions in each case were directed to God alone. The next step swerved lamentably from that principle of worship, and the
petitioners addressed their requests to angels and sainted men in
heaven; at first, however, confining their petitions to the asking for
their prayers and intercessions with Almighty God.",14072,1700s

"Not a few had lost different
articles of clothing, which had dropped into the sea from the beacon and
building. Some wanted jackets; others, from want of hats, wore
nightcaps; each was, in fact, more or less curtailed in his wardrobe, and
it must be confessed that at best the party were but in a very tattered
condition. This morning was occupied in removing the artificers and
their bedding on board of the tender; and although their personal luggage
was easily shifted, the boats had, nevertheless, many articles to remove
from the beacon-house, and were consequently employed in this service
till eleven a.m.  All hands being collected and just ready to embark, as
the water had nearly overflowed the rock, the writer, in taking leave,
after alluding to the harmony which had ever marked the conduct of those
employed on the Bell Rock, took occasion to compliment the great zeal,
attention, and abilities of Mr. Peter Logan and Mr. Francis Watt,
foremen; Captain James Wilson, landing-master; and Captain David Taylor,
commander of the tender, who, in their several departments, had so
faithfully discharged the duties assigned to them, often under
circumstances the most difficult and trying. The health of these
gentlemen was drunk with much warmth of feeling by the artificers and
seamen, who severally expressed the satisfaction they had experienced in
acting under them; after which the whole party left the rock. In sailing past the floating light mutual compliments were made by a
display of flags between that vessel and the tender; and at five p.m. the
latter vessel entered the harbour of Arbroath, where the party were
heartily welcomed by a numerous company of spectators, who had collected
to see the artificers arrive after so long an absence from the port.",280,1800s

nonsense, Puss; true lovers and all the rest of it—all nonsense; but

proudly, ‘I’m not clear to-night, among other absurdities, but that I’m
the father of two handsome girls.’

‘All that one of them has ever done, or may do—may do, dearest father—to
cause you pain or grief, forgive her,’ said Marion, ‘forgive her now,
when her heart is full. Say that you forgive her. That you will forgive

"Again her wakening wail outbroke
As wildly, sword in hand, she woke
And struck one swift and bitter stroke
   That healed her, and she died. And sorrowing for their strange love’s sake
Rode Balen forth by lawn and lake,
By moor and moss and briar and brake,
And in his heart their sorrow spake
   Whose lips were dumb as death, and said
Mute words of presage blind and vain
As rain-stars blurred and marred by rain
To wanderers on a moonless main
   Where night and day seem dead. Then toward a sunbright wildwood side
He looked and saw beneath it ride
A knight whose arms afar espied
By note of name and proof of pride
   Bare witness of his brother born,
His brother Balan, hard at hand,
Twin flower of bright Northumberland,
Twin sea-bird of their loud sea-strand,
   Twin song-bird of their morn. Ah then from Balen passed away
All dread of night, all doubt of day,
All care what life or death might say,
All thought of all worse months than May:
   Only the might of joy in love
Brake forth within him as a fire,
And deep delight in deep desire
Of far-flown days whose full-souled quire
   Rang round from the air above. From choral earth and quiring air
Rang memories winged like songs that bear
Sweet gifts for spirit and sense to share:
For no man’s life knows love more fair
   And fruitful of memorial things
Than this the deep dear love that breaks
With sense of life on life, and makes
The sundawn sunnier as it wakes
   Where morning round it rings.",2136,1800s
"For our adversaries know in
what sense Luther intended this remark that original sin remains
after Baptism. He always wrote thus, namely, that Baptism removes
the guilt of original sin, although the material, as they call it, of
the sin, i.e., concupiscence, remains. He also added in reference to
the material that the Holy Ghost, given through Baptism, begins to
mortify the concupiscence, and creates new movements [a new light, a
new sense and spirit] in man. In the same manner, Augustine also
speaks who says: Sin is remitted in Baptism, not in such a manner
that it no longer exists, but so that it is not imputed. Here he
confesses openly that sin exists, i.e., that it remains although it
is not imputed.",6744,1400s

"At these words they departed,
shrugging their shoulders. Jesus remained alone with the adulteress,
whom the Jews would not have treated so tenderly if she had been really
culpable. On this he said to her, ""Since no man hath accused thee,
neither will I condemn thee: Go then, and sin no more."" Having happily escaped from this danger, Jesus thought himself in
safety; but, induced by his natural petulence, he again hazarded a
sermon in the temple: he spoke only of himself; and what follows was
nearly his strongest argument: ""You ask,"" said he, ""a full proof by two
witnesses. Now I bear witness of my Father, and my Father bears witness
of me; you therefore ought to believe in me;"" which amounts to this; _my
Father proves me, and I prove my Father_.",39052,1700s

obliged to the Marquis for having procured her so inestimable, so

Letter Tenth To Anne Boleyn


The uneasiness my doubts about your health gave me, disturbed and alarmed
me exceedingly, and I should not have had any quiet without hearing
certain tidings. But now, since you have as yet felt nothing, I hope, and
am assured that it will spare you, as I hope it is doing with us. For when
we were at Walton, two ushers, two valets de chambres and your brother,
master-treasurer, fell ill, but are now quite well; and since we have
returned to our house at Hunsdon, we have been perfectly well, and have
not, at present, one sick person, God be praised; and I think, if you
would retire from Surrey, as we did, you would escape all danger. There is
another thing that may comfort you, which is, that, in truth in this
distemper few or no women have been taken ill, and what is more, no person
of our court, and few elsewhere, have died of it.",32155,1400s

thus Rome began to have an emperor of the west. And whereas the popes
used to be established by the emperors, the latter now began to have
need of the popes at their elections; the empire continued to lose
its powers, while the church acquired them; and, by these means, she
constantly extended her authority over temporal princes. The Lombards, having now been two hundred and thirty-two years in the
country, were strangers only in name, and Charles, wishing to reorganize
the states of Italy, consented that they should occupy the places in
which they had been brought up, and call the province after their own
name, Lombardy. That they might be led to respect the Roman name, he
ordered all that part of Italy adjoining to them, which had been under
the exarchate of Ravenna, to be called Romagna. Besides this, he created
his son Pepin, king of Italy, whose dominion extended to Benevento; all
the rest being possessed by the Greek emperor, with whom Charles was

intermediate in color to the standards for 2 and 4 and not definitely
more nearly referable to one than the other, it was given the number
three; if it resembled the standard for 4, it was numbered four; and if

"In better times,
the dispute possibly would perhaps have been settled much more
conformably with the principles of justice, by both of them being
impeached for their mal-administration, and their wanton and lavish
waste of the best blood and treasure of their country. In September the new theatre at Covent-Garden was opened; and, in
consequence of the managers having increased the prices, a riot
commenced, which continued night after night for nearly three months. It
was universally known by the name of ""the O. P. row;"" that was, a
contention for _old prices_, by the audience, and a determined struggle
on the part of the managers, to enforce and continue the new and
increased prices. I may be asked by some, ""what has this to do with your
Memoirs, or with the political history of the times""? I answer, it has
nothing to do with my Memoirs, as I was not in London during the whole
of the row; but I shall by and by show, that it had a great deal more to
do with political matters, or rather with a _political party,_ than was
at the time imagined, or than is even now suspected.",8461,1700s
"There is
another thing that may comfort you, which is, that, in truth in this
distemper few or no women have been taken ill, and what is more, no person
of our court, and few elsewhere, have died of it. For which reason I beg
you, my entirely beloved, not to frighten yourself nor be too uneasy at
our absence; for wherever I am, I am yours, and yet we must sometimes
submit to our misfortunes, for whoever will struggle against fate is
generally but so much the farther from gaining his end: wherefore comfort
yourself, and take courage and avoid the pestilence as much as you can,
for I hope shortly to make you sing, _la renvoyé_. No more at present,
from lack of time, but that I wish you in my arms, that I might a little
dispel your unreasonable thoughts. Written by the hand of him who is and alway will be yours,

Im- H. R. -mutable. Letter Eleventh To Anne Boleyn


The cause of my writing at this time, good sweetheart, is only to
understand of your good health and prosperity; whereof to know I would be
as glad as in manner mine own, praying God that (an it be His pleasure) to
send us shortly together, for I promise you I long for it.",32155,1400s
"I never suffered so much, appeared so awkward, or received more
unexpected mortifications. As soon as we had risen from table, I
withdrew from that wicked woman; I had the pleasure of seeing Saint
Lambert and Madam de'Houdetot approach me, and we conversed together a
part of the afternoon, upon things very indifferent it is true, but with
the same familiarity as before my involuntary error. This friendly
attention was not lost upon my heart, and could Saint Lambert have read
what passed there, he certainly would have been satisfied with it. I can
safely assert that although on my arrival the presence of Madam
d'Houdetot gave me the most violent palpitations, on returning from the
house I scarcely thought of her; my mind was entirely taken up with Saint
Lambert. Notwithstanding the malignant sarcasms of Madam de Blainville, the dinner
was of great service to me, and I congratulated myself upon not having
refused the invitation.",3910,1700s

"This has usually, to my mind, something set and artificial about it,
although in its most perfect form the art almost succeeds in concealing
itself. But, at all events, ''conversation'' is talk in evening dress,
with perhaps a little powder and a touch of rouge. 'T is like one of
those wise virgins who are said to look their best by lamplight. And

"When the
time had come for Richard Field to entertain the company with the
promised tale from his life experience, his hope of escaping this ordeal
had altogether vanished. Mrs. Field, it had been noticed as early as breakfast time, was inclined
to be nervous on her husband’s account. Five years of married life had
not cured her of this amiable symptom, and she made but a light meal. He, on the other hand, ate heartily and without signs of disturbance. Apparently he was not even conscious of the glances that his wife so
frequently stole at him.",1387,1800s

him began to leave their places, for the interval. It was only natural
that he should follow their example; and if he did so, it was not only
natural but necessary that he should pass immediately in front of the
box in question. Summoning all his courage, but keeping his eyes
lowered, Francis drew near the spot. His progress was slow, for the old

went. What was he to do?",839,1800s
"“The citizens? Will
they come out to give battle?”

“If it were only citizens, monseigneur,” I said, “the battle would not be
very sharp.”

“Who will be with them?” he replied; “will you be there yourself?”

“That would be a very bad omen,” I said; “it would look too much like the
proceedings of the League.”

After a little pause, he said, “But now, to be serious, would you be so
foolish as to embark with those men?”

“You know, monseigneur,” I said, “that I am engaged already; and that,
moreover, as Coadjutor of Paris, I am concerned both by honour and
interest in its preservation. I shall be your Highness’s humble servant
as long as I live, except in this one point.”

I saw he was touched to the quick, but he kept his temper, and said these
very words: “When you engage in a bad cause I will pity you, but shall
have no reason to complain of you. Nor do you complain of me; but do me
that justice you owe me, namely, to own that all I promised to Longueil
and Broussel is since annulled by the conduct of the Parliament.”

He afterwards showed me many personal favours, and offered to make my
peace with the Court. I assured him of my obedience and zeal for his
service in everything that did not interfere with the engagements I had
entered into, which, as he himself owned, I could not possibly avoid.",3846,1600s

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be

the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

"_Baricellus_, and _Lionardo di Capoa_, observe the same likewise, in
Relation to the Practice of _Physick_ in that Country. _Baglivi_, in
the Scheme he lays down for erecting of Colleges for the Improvement
of _Physick_, tells us, that every Fellow of his Literate Society
must have one _Disease_ allotted him for the Task of his whole Life;
and which elsewhere he says is not sufficient for the illustrating
the Province of one _Disease_; but that we lie under a Necessity of
taking in Materials from all Hands. But there is no Man that we know
of, has spoke more agreeably of this Matter than Dr _Harris_, in his
_Pharmacologia Anti-Empirica_, he owns that he took more than ordinary
Pains in one particular _Disease_, and assures us he verily believes if
learned Men, after a compleat Acquisition of the universal Method of
_Physick_, and a necessary Search into the Nature and Cures of those
manifold Infirmities and Diseases, which, with a kind of infinite
Variety, do afflict Mankind, would, with their utmost Vigour and
Resolution, prosecute the Knowledge of some one _Disease_ eminently
above others; they would, most certainly, find a particular Providence
attending and assisting them in so good and honest a Design. He adds,
a few Pages farther, that wherever a Man’s Thoughts are intent and
fixed, wherever his Genius does naturally incline, and all his Aims
and Application do continually tend, whether it be to pertinent or
insignificant Matters; whether it be to useful, or else meerly curious
Things; if he has but tolerable Parts, and Education corresponding,
he can hardly ever miss; it is hardly possible he should miss the
becoming Eminent, and in great Measure perfect, (I mean perfect (says
he) according to the Modulum of Human Capacity) in that one Point. But there is one Thing to be recommended to the Consideration of
the Person, who takes upon him the Enquiry into the Nature of one
particular _Disease_, which perhaps he might be very liable to err in,
if not cautioned against; and that is, that he be not too bold and rash
in his Attempts; for, as _Galen_ says, _The_ Physician’s _Art is not
like that of an_ Artificer, _who may make what Experiments he pleases,
to satisfy his Curiosity; because if he spoils the Materials he works
on, no Body is endangered by the Miscarriage: In Corpore autem humane_
(adds he) _ea tentare quæ non sunt Experientium comprobata Periculo
non vacat, cum temerariæ Experientiæ Finis sit totius Animantis
internecio_.",52993,1600s
"This explains the indifference, or rather the firm resolve,
on Mazarin's part; never to take orders, but to remain simply 'tonsure'
or 'minore',--he who controls at least forty abbeys, as well as a
bishopric. ""Look at the young monarch,"" it continued, ""and consider how closely he
resembles his Eminence, the same haughty glance; the same uncontrolled
passion for pompous buildings, luxurious dress and equipages; the same
deference and devotion to the Queen-mother; the same independent customs,
precepts, and laws; the same aversion for the Parisians; the same
resentment against the honest folk of the Fronde."" This final phrase easily disclosed its origin; nor upon this point had
     his Majesty the slightest shadow of a doubt. The same evening he sent full instructions to the lieutenant-general of
police, and two days afterwards the nocturnal vendor of pamphlets found
himself caught in a trap. The King wished him to be brought to Saint Germain, so that he might
identify him personally; and, as he pretended to be half-witted or an
idiot, he was thrown half naked into a dungeon.",3847,1600s
"Shun it as you would the road to
destruction. Take not the first step,--the moment you do, all may be
lost. Say not that you can command yourselves, and can stop when you
approach the confines of danger. So thousands have thought as sincerely
as yourselves--and yet they fell. 'The probabilities that we shall fall
where so many have fallen,' says Dr. Dwight, 'are millions to one; and
the contrary opinion is only the dream of lunacy.'",23860,1700s
"“I'm going to leave Aunt
Hannah's door open, so you'll have good air--she isn't in there. She's
writing letters in my room, Now here's a book, and you _may_ read, but
I should prefer you to sleep,” she nodded brightly as she went out and
shut the door quietly. Then, like the guilty conspirator she was, she
went down-stairs to wait for Arkwright. It was a fine plan. Arkwright was due at ten o'clock--Billy had
specially asked him to come at that hour.",362,1800s
"“Don't sit down!” she cried. “You would stand up if the President of the
United States was going by, even if he was only going fishing. How much
more should you stand up in honor of living souls passing forward to
find their Saviour!”

The psychological moment was upon them. Groans and cries arose, and
a palpable ferment stirred the throng. The exhortation to sinners
to declare themselves, to come to the altar, was not only on the
revivalist's lips: it seemed to quiver in the very air, to be borne on
every inarticulate exclamation in the clamor of the brethren.",133,1800s
"They merit indeed a volume of themselves. This city could once
boast of upwards of _thirty parish churches_; of which very nearly a
_dozen_ have been recently (I mean during the Revolution) converted into
_warehouses_. It forms a curious, and yet melancholy mélange--this strange
misappropriation of what was formerly held most sacred, to the common and
lowest purposes of civil life! You enter these warehouses, or offices of
business, and see the broken shaft, the battered capital, and
half-demolished altar-piece--the gilded or the painted frieze--in the midst
of bales of goods--casks, ropes, and bags of cotton: while, without, the
same spirit of demolition prevails in the fractured column, and tottering
arch way. Thus time brings its changes and decays--premature as well as
natural: and the noise of the car-men and injunctions of the clerk are now
heard, where formerly there reigned a general silence, interrupted only by
the matin or evening chaunt!",16224,1700s

arranging the narrative, and divesting it of such parts as were neither

"Since then we cannot live in this world without ceremonies and works,
since the hot and inexperienced period of youth has need of being
restrained and protected by such bonds, and since every one is bound
to keep under his own body by attention to these things, therefore
the minister of Christ must be prudent and faithful in so ruling and
teaching the people of Christ, in all these matters, that no root of
bitterness may spring up among them, and so many be defiled, as Paul
warned the Hebrews; that is, that they may not lose the faith, and begin
to be defiled by a belief in works as the means of justification. This
is a thing which easily happens, and defiles very many, unless faith be
constantly inculcated along with works. It is impossible to avoid this
evil, when faith is passed over in silence, and only the ordinances of
men are taught, as has been done hitherto by the pestilent, impious,
and soul-destroying traditions of our pontiffs and opinions of our
theologians. An infinite number of souls have been drawn down to hell by
these snares, so that you may recognise the work of antichrist. In brief, as poverty is imperilled amid riches, honesty amid business,
humility amid honours, abstinence amid feasting, purity amid pleasures,
so is justification by faith imperilled among ceremonies.",1911,1400s
"The Force of the Heart in the extream Parts being also much diminish'd,
thro' the numerous Ramifications of the Vessels, the Motion of the Blood

This is occasion'd by the greater Intestine Motion and Colluctation of

which are popular in their day. Thus much I know:... that the Author, with a spirit amiable at all times,
and which would have been rever'd by Antiquity, seems far less interested
concerning any Fame or Advantage he may derive from it to himself, than in
the pleasure of giving a printed Copy of it, as a tribute of duty and
affection, to his MOTHER; in whose pleasure, if it succeeds, his filial
heart places the gratification of which it is most desirous. It is much to
be a POET, such as he will be found:... it is more to be such a MAN.",9092,1700s
"This may or may not be followed by an opposite reaction. In the depressive phase patients may feel gloomy, speak slowly, and
look worried. A feeling of inadequacy may lead to self-punishment and

depressive state years later.",67545,1900s

award just punishments, to engage in just wars, to serve as soldiers,

is “a good station for fishing;” and, from what I have seen of the
district, I am quite prepared to bear out this statement. There is no spot in the world where you can get more fishing, or where
you can fish for a longer period. Some fishermen come here and fish for
a day, and others stop and fish for a month. You can hang on and fish
for a year, if you want to: it will be all the same. The _Angler’s Guide to the Thames_ says that “jack and perch are also

"If he think it not worth while to examine his works all thro’, let him
make an experiment in that part, where he treats of usurpation; and let
him try, whether he can, with all his skill, make Sir Robert
intelligible, and consistent with himself, or common sense. I should not
speak so plainly of a gentleman, long since past answering, had not the
pulpit, of late years, publicly owned his doctrine, and made it the
current divinity of the times. It is necessary those men, who taking on
them to be teachers, have so dangerously misled others, should be openly
shewed of what authority this their Patriarch is, whom they have so
blindly followed, that so they may either retract what upon so ill
grounds they have vented, and cannot be maintained; or else justify
those principles which they preached up for gospel; though they had no
better an author than an English courtier: for I should not have writ
against Sir Robert, or taken the pains to shew his mistakes,
inconsistencies, and want of (what he so much boasts of, and pretends
wholly to build on) scripture-proofs, were there not men amongst us,
who, by crying up his books, and espousing his doctrine, save me from
the reproach of writing against a dead adversary. They have been so
zealous in this point, that, if I have done him any wrong, I cannot hope
they should spare me. I wish, where they have done the truth and the
public wrong, they would be as ready to redress it, and allow its just
weight to this reflection, viz.",7370,1600s
"Go, descend with our guests to a place of safety;

Wilder eagerly disappeared in the cabin, whither Mrs Wyllys had already
withdrawn; and, after communicating the intentions of his Commander to
avoid an action, he conducted them into the depths of the vessel, in
order that no casualty might arrive to imbitter his recollections of
the hour. This grateful duty promptly and solicitously performed, our
adventurer again sought the deck, with the velocity of thought. Notwithstanding his absence had seemed but of a moment, the scene had
indeed changed in all its hostile images. In place of the flag of
France, he found the ensign of England floating at the peak of the
“Dolphin,” and a quick and intelligible exchange of lesser signals in
active operation between the two vessels. Of all that cloud of canvas
which had so lately borne down the vessel of the Rover, her top sails
alone remained distended to the yards; the remainder was hanging in
festoons, and fluttering loosely before a favourable breeze.",11409,1700s

"Of the moderate means placed at his disposal he was always properly
careful, expending very little upon himself. He had a few pounds laid
up in the Savings' Bank at Canterbury. This amount, together with his
humble store of goods and chattels, consisting chiefly of the prints
which had adorned his room, he left, by a kind of will, to his
untiring and constant friend, Captain Ommanney, in token of gratitude

"Let it be borne in mind that dialect properly so called is something all
unlike, for instance, the mere jargon of London streets. The difference
may be measured by the fact that Italian dialects have a highly organized
and orderly grammar. The Londoner cannot keep the small and loose order
of the grammar of good English; the Genoese conjugates his patois verbs,
with subjunctives and all things of that handsome kind, lacked by the
English of Universities. The middle class--the _piccolo mondo_--hat shares Italian dialect with
the poor are more strictly local in their manners than either the opulent

"They
remained in their covert until night, when they started again on their
long journey, taking a new route to avoid the Indians. At daybreak
they again concealed themselves, but travelled the next night and day
without resting. By this time they had consumed all the bread which
they had taken, and were fainting from hunger and weariness. Just at
the close of the third day they were providentially enabled to kill a
pigeon and a small tortoise, a part of which they ate raw, not daring
to make a fire, which might attract the watchful eyes of savages. On
the sixth day they struck upon an old Indian path, and, following it
until night, came suddenly upon a camp of the enemy.",879,1800s

"But
the waves dashed foaming up among the bare rocks at her feet, mingling
their cold spray with her tears, and gave no answer to her prayer. When Ripple saw the mother’s grief, she longed to comfort her; so,
bending tenderly beside her, where she knelt upon the shore, the little
Spirit told her how her child lay softly sleeping, far down in a lovely
place, where sorrowing tears were shed, and gentle hands laid garlands
over him. But all in vain she whispered kindly words; the weeping
mother only cried,—

“Dear Spirit, can you use no charm or spell to make the waves bring
back my child, as full of life and strength as when they swept him from
my side? O give me back my little child, or let me lie beside him in
the bosom of the cruel sea.”

“Most gladly will I help you if I can, though I have little power to
use; then grieve no more, for I will search both earth and sea, to find
some friend who can bring back all you have lost. Watch daily on the

"It has generally been assumed that it depicts both the
tragic and heroic phases of the world crisis and an unshaken confidence
in final victory over Nazi barbarism. Prokofieff himself would provide
no clue to its program other than that it was “a symphony about the
spirit of man.”

When Germany was at last defeated, Prokofieff’s pen was again busy
celebrating the event. This time it was an “Ode to the End of the War”,
scored for sixteen double basses, eight harps and four pianos. In 1947
Prokofieff composed his Sixth Symphony, and it was shortly after its
first performance that the Central Committee of the Communist Party
issued its stinging denunciation of certain tendencies in the music of
Prokofieff and six other Soviet composers. The occasion of the official
rebuke was a new opera by Vano Muradeli, “Great Friendship.” This work
was found offensive as a distortion of history and a false and imperfect
exploitation of national material.",50226,1900s

admirable. After exhausting old ones, she invented new; and when
the new lost their efficacy, she recurred to the old. She had often
observed, that the blunt method of contradicting, which some bosom
friends practise in conversation, is of sovereign power to provoke;
and this consequently, though unpolite, she disdained not to imitate. It had the greater effect, as it was in diametrical opposition to the

me through a Window, where I might hear him, and he hear and see me

more considerable Value. I stayed there above a Quarter of a Moon, when
I was again sent back to _Pylonas_, for if we had stayed a Day or two

taken out of other Regions by Force. The Commander in chief of these
_Spaniards_ summoned one of the Dynasts or Rulers of that Province
which they entred into, to appear before him, and command him to take
these Idols with him, distribute them through his Countrey and exchange
every single Idol for an _Indian_ Man or Woman, otherwise he would make
War against him. The abovesaid Lord compelled to it by fear did so
accordingly with a command, that his Subjects should adore Worship and
Honour them, and in compensation send Indians Male and Female into
servitude. The terrified People delivered up their Children, and by
this means there was an end made of this Sacrilegious Merchandize, and
thus the _Casic_ satisfied the greedy desires of the (I dare not say
Christian) _Spaniards_. One of these Sacrilegious Robbers was _John
Garcia_ by name, who being very sick and at the point of dath, had

aid their own servants by their patronage more than others; the divine
mother, as she is the queen of all, so is she the advocate of all, and
cares for the salvation of all. [544]

She cares for all, even for sinners, and glories especially in being
called their advocate; as she herself declared to the venerable sister
Mary Villani, saying: “Next to the title of mother of God, I glory most
in being named the advocate of sinners.” The blessed Amadeus says, that
our queen is always before the divine Majesty, interceding for us with
her powerful prayers. [545] And since in heaven she knows perfectly our
miseries and necessities, she cannot but have pity on us; so, with
the affection of a mother, moved by compassion for us, she kindly and
mercifully endeavors to relieve and save us. [546] It is with good reason,
then, that Richard of St. Laurence encourages every one, however degraded
he may be, to appeal confidently to this sweet advocate, in the certain
belief that he will always find her ready to help him. [547] It is also
well said by Godfrey, that Mary is ever ready to pray for all.",72411,1600s

with ammunition and provisions for a long siege; all who could carry
arms (the very artisans not excepted), became soldiers; the houses
before the town, and especially the cloisters, were pulled down, that
the besiegers might not avail themselves of them to cover their attack. The few adherents of the crown, awed by the multitude, were silent; no
Roman Catholic ventured to stir himself. Anarchy and rebellion had
taken the place of good order, and the fanaticism of a foolhardy priest
gave laws instead of the legal dispensers of justice. The male
population was numerous, their courage confirmed by despair, their
confidence unbounded that the siege would be raised, while their hatred
against the Roman Catholic religion was excited to the highest pitch. Many had no mercy to expect; all abhorred the general thraldom of an

"There is little factual information about John Day except that he was
born in Culpeper County, Va. about 1770. It is known also that in 1810
this tall pioneer “with an elastic step as if he trod on springs” joined
John Jacob Astor’s overland expedition under Wilson Price Hunt to
establish a vast fur-gathering network in the western states based on a
major trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. The expedition arrived in the vicinity of the Grand Tetons, in what is
now Wyoming, in September 1811, and with the onset of winter met
disaster along the Snake River. When they ran out of food near the
present site of Twin Falls, Idaho, Hunt divided the expedition into four
parties to seek food and a feasible route through the canyons. As
described in Washington Irving’s _Astoria_, the party that included John
Day became widely separated from the others; experienced terrible
hardships while wintering with Indians near Huntington; and was
eventually reduced to just John Day and Ramsey Crooks.",46969,1900s
"When Beauty was alone, she felt a great deal of compassion for poor
Beast. ""Alas, (said she,) 'tis a thousand pities any thing so
good-natured should be so ugly."" Beauty spent three months very contentedly in the palace: every evening
Beast paid her a visit, and talked to her during supper, very
rationally, with plain good common sense, but never with what the world
calls wit; and Beauty daily discovered some valuable qualifications in
the monster; and seeing him often, had so accustomed her to his
deformity, that, far from dreading the time of his visit, she would
often look on her watch to see when it would be nine; for the Beast
never missed coming at that hour. There was but one thing that gave
Beauty any concern, which was, that every night, before she went to bed,
the monster always asked her, if she would be his wife. One day she
said to him, ""Beast, you make me very uneasy, I wish I could consent to
marry you, but I am too sincere to make you believe that will ever
happen: I shall always esteem you as a friend; endeavour to be satisfied
with this.""",7074,1700s

commandment, Ex. 20, 15: Thou shalt not steal. The abandonment of
property has no command or advice in the Scriptures. For evangelical
poverty does not consist in the abandonment of property, but in not
being avaricious, in not trusting in wealth, just as David was poor
in a most wealthy kingdom. Therefore, since the abandonment of property is merely a human
tradition, it is a useless service.",6744,1400s

The Certainty of a Crop is much to be regarded; it being better to be
secure of a moderate Crop, than to have but a mere Hazard of a great
one. The Farmer who adheres to the old Method is often deceiv’d in his
Expectation, when his Crop at coming into Ear is very big, as well as
when ’tis in Danger of being too little. Our hoeing Farmer is much less
liable to the Hazard of either of those Extremes; for when his Wheat
is big, ’tis not apt to lodge or fall down, which Accident is usually
the utter Ruin of the other; he is free from the Causes which make the
contrary Crop too little. A very effectual Means to prevent the failing of a Crop of Wheat, is to

noble lord has justly represented it, an innovation that threatens
nothing less than the destruction of our liberties, and the dissolution
of our government. Our vigilance ought, therefore, to be very anxiously
employed in regulating this new part of our government, and adapting it,
in such a manner, to the national constitution, that no detriment may
arise from it, and that our civil rights may be protected, not
oppressed, by the military power. To this purpose, says the noble lord, the soldiers are to be restrained
by a due subordination to the magistrate, a position undoubtedly true,
but now superfluously urged: for it was never controverted by the noble
person whose opinion he intended to oppose. Should any man assert, my lords, that the army ought to be formed into a
distinct and independent society, which should receive laws only from a
council of war, and have no other governour than their officers, none
should oppose such an assertion with more ardour or constancy than
myself, but what was never advanced it is unnecessary to confute. Yet, my lords, to obviate those dangers from the army which have been so
strongly and justly represented, it is necessary, not only that a legal
subordination to the civil authority be firmly established, but that a
personal dependence on the ministry be taken away.",10351,1700s

occasioned by Jacopo Piccinino having subsided, and human weapons
laid aside, the heavens seemed to make war against the earth; dreadful
tempestuous winds then occurring, which produced effects unprecedented
in Tuscany, and which to posterity will appear marvelous and
unaccountable. On the twenty-fourth of August, about an hour before
daybreak, there arose from the Adriatic near Ancona, a whirlwind, which
crossing from east to west, again reached the sea near Pisa, accompanied
by thick clouds, and the most intense and impenetrable darkness,
covering a breadth of about two miles in the direction of its course. Under some natural or supernatural influence, this vast and overcharged
volume of condensed vapor burst; its fragments contended with
indescribable fury, and huge bodies sometimes ascending toward heaven,
and sometimes precipitated upon the earth, struggled, as it were,
in mutual conflict, whirling in circles with intense velocity, and
accompanied by winds, impetuous beyond all conception; while flashes of
awful brilliancy, and murky, lurid flames incessantly broke forth. From these confused clouds, furious winds, and momentary fires, sounds
issued, of which no earthquake or thunder ever heard could afford the
least idea; striking such awe into all, that it was thought the end
of the world had arrived, that the earth, waters, heavens, and entire
universe, mingling together, were being resolved into their ancient
chaos. Wherever this awful tempest passed, it produced unprecedented and
marvelous effects; but these were more especially experienced near the

MY DEAR FRIEND: As this is the last, or last letter but one, that I think
I shall write before I have the pleasure of seeing you here, it may not
be amiss to prepare you a little for our interview, and for the time we
shall pass together. Before kings and princes meet, ministers on each
side adjust the important points of precedence, arm chairs, right hand
and left, etc., so that they know previously what they are to expect,
what they have to trust to; and it is right they should; for they
commonly envy or hate, but most certainly distrust each other. We shall
meet upon very different terms; we want no such preliminaries: you know
my tenderness, I know your affection. My only object, therefore, is to
make your short stay with me as useful as I can to you; and yours, I
hope, is to co-operate with me. Whether, by making it wholesome, I shall
make it pleasant to you, I am not sure.",3361,1600s

stifled, where are the diagnostics, by which the state of the mind is to
be known? The wise Author of all things, who did nothing in vain,
doubtless intended them as symptoms, by which to judge of the diseases
of the heart; and it is impossible diseases should be cured before
they are known. If the stream be so cut off as to prevent communication,
or so choked up as to defeat discovery, how shall we ever reach the
source, out of which are the issues of life? THIS cunning, which, of all the different dispositions girls discover,
is most to be dreaded, is increased by nothing so much as by fear.",19595,1700s

second act, young Prince Ferdinand [Youngest Brother, Father of the JENA
Ferdinand] entered the Royal Box; and flinging himself on the Princess's
neck with a burst of tears, said, 'Ah, my dear Ulrique, it is over,
then; and I shall never see you more!' These words were a signal given
to the grief which was shut in all hearts, to burst forth with the
greatest vehemence. The Princess replied only with sobs; holding her
Brother in her arms. The Two Queens could not restrain their tears; the
Princes and Princesses followed the example: grief is epidemical; it
gained directly all the Boxes of the first rank, where the Court and
Nobility were. Each had his own causes of regret, and each melted into
tears.",2114,1700s

"Such old men, as are too poor to allow themselves provisions of
this kind, may do very well with bread, panado, and eggs; things,
which no poor man can want, unless it be common beggars, and, as
we call them, vagabonds, about whom we are not bound to make
ourselves uneasy, since they have brought themselves to that pass
by their indolence; and had better be dead than alive; for they
are a disgrace to human nature. But, though a poor man should eat
nothing but bread, panado, and eggs, there is no necessity for his
eating more than his stomach can digest. And, whoever does not
trespass in point of either quantity or quality, cannot die but by
mere dissolution. O, what a difference there is between a regular
and an irregular life! One gives longevity and health, the other
produces diseases and untimely deaths.",30660,1400s
"As touching the matter of Wilton, my lord cardinal hath had the nuns
before him, and examined them, Mr. Bell being present; which hath
certified me that, for a truth, she had confessed herself (which we would
have had abbess) to have had two children by two sundry priests; and,
further, since hath been kept by a servant of the Lord Broke that was, and
that not long ago. Wherefore I would not, for all the gold in the world,
clog your conscience nor mine to make her ruler of a house which is of so
ungodly demeanour; nor, I trust, you would not that neither for brother
nor sister, I should so destain mine honour or conscience. And, as
touching the prioress, or Dame Eleanor's eldest sister, though there is
not any evident case proved against them, and that the prioress is so old
that for many years she could not be as she was named; yet
notwithstanding, to do you pleasure, I have done that neither of them
shall have it, but that some other good and well-disposed woman shall have
it, whereby the house shall be the better reformed (whereof I ensure you
it had much need), and God much the better served. As touching your abode at Hever, do therein as best shall like you, for
you best know what air doth best with you; but I would it were come
thereto (if it pleased God), that neither of us need care for that, for I
ensure you I think it long. Suche is fallen sick of the sweat, and
therefore I send you this bearer, because I think you long to hear

themselves, from the earliest Times, in their Judgment of things! How
rash in taking Parties, and fomenting Discords! How obstinate and
inflexible in maintaining the Cause, which they had once undertaken, let
it be ever so bad! The only thing that can be alleged against the
Character of _Flavianus_, is his having accepted the Bishoprick of
_Antioch_, contrary to the Oath he had taken, on Occasion of the
Agreement between _Meletius_ and _Paulinus_, as I have related
above[1330]. That he took such an Oath, is vouched both by _Socrates_
and _Sozomen_[1331].",63336,1600s
"Besides, they always add a correction to the other passages, which
treat of faith, namely, that they ought to be understood as applying
to _fides formata_. Here they add no correction that there is also
need of the faith that holds that we are accounted righteous for the
sake of Christ as Propitiator. Thus the adversaries exclude Christ
from justification, and teach only a righteousness of the Law. But
let us return to Paul. No one can infer anything more from this text
than that love is necessary.",6744,1400s
"It is all
very well so long as I remain with her, and she wishes fervently that
that may be for ever; for never, she says, eloquently, never in all her
Cheltenham and Belvern experience, has she encountered such a jewel of a
lodger as her dear Miss 'Amilton, so little trouble, and always a bit of
praise for her plain cooking, and a pleasant word for the children, to
whom most lodgers object, and such an interest in the cow and the fowl
and the garden and the canaries, and such kindness in painting the
name of the cottage, so that it is the finest thing in the village, and
nobody can get past the 'ouse without stopping to gape at it! But when
her American lodger leaves her, she asks,--and who is she that can
expect to keep a beautiful young lady who will be naming her own cottage
and painting signboards for herself before long, likely?--but when
her American lodger is gone, how is she, Mrs. Bobby, to put by a few
shillings a month towards the debt on the cottage? These are some of the
problems she presents to me. I have turned them over and over in my mind
as I have worked, and even asked Willie Beresford in my weekly letter
what he could suggest. Of course he could not suggest anything: men
never can; although he offered to come there and lodge for a month at
twenty-five pounds a week.",1278,1800s

myself with the idea that it was ill founded. ""They should consider,"" said I, ""that they have no satisfaction to look
for beyond each other; there every enjoyment is centred; but I am a poor
solitary being, who need some amusement beyond what I can supply myself. The mind, after being confined at home for a while, sends the
imagination abroad in quest of new treasures; and the body may as well
accompany it, for aught I can see."" General Richman and lady have ever appeared solicitous to promote my
happiness since I have resided with them. They have urged my acceptance

"CHAPTER XI


All men love to gain their ends; most men are contented with the
shortest road to them, while others like by-paths. Some carry an innate
love of triumph to a pitch of epicurism, and are not content unless the
triumph be achieved in a certain way, making collateral passions
accessories before or after the fact; and Murphy was one of the number. To him, a triumph without _fun_ was beef without mustard, lamb without
salad, turbot without lobster sauce. Now, to entangle Furlong in their
meshes was not sufficient for him; to detain him from his friends, every
moment betraying something of their electioneering movements, though
sufficiently ludicrous in itself, was not enough for Murtough!--he would
make his captive a source of ridicule as well as profit, and while
plenty of real amusements might have served his end, to divert the
stranger for the day, this mock fishing-party was planned to brighten
with fresh beams the halo of the ridiculous which already encircled the
magnanimous Furlong. ""I'm still in the dark,"" said Dick, ""about the salmon.",21817,1700s
"If
the Fault be not in _Procopius_, ’tis an Errour of _Stephanus_, who
writes _Justinianæ_ for _Jucundianæ_. But ’tis plain, that _Stephanus_
wrote long before the Time of _Justinian_; so that if there be any
Blunder, ’tis none of _Stephanus_, but _Hermolaus_, a Grammarian of
_Constantinople_, who abridg’d the Commentaries of _Stephanus_, and
dedicated them to _Justinian_. If I might give my Opinion, I should
rather call it _Sycæ Justinianæ_, than _Jucundianæ_, because it
appears to me it should be so, not only by comparing some Books of
_Procopius_ and _Justinian_ which have been publish’d, but also by the
Authorities of several MSS. _Justinian_ asserts in his _Constitutions_,
_That ’tis agreeable to Equity, if a Corpse be carried to the Grave
to a great Distance, that the Deacons attending it, should have some
Acknowledgment_. He subjoyns a little after, _That he is of the same
Opinion, if the Corpse be bury’d within the new Walls of the City

independent of Otaheite, is between forty and fifty years old. He is
bald-headed, which is rather an uncommon appearance in these islands
at that age. He wore a kind of turban, and seemed ashamed to shew his
head. But whether they themselves considered this deficiency of hair
as a mark of disgrace, or whether they entertained a notion of our
considering it as such, I cannot say. We judged that the latter

accept his escort after church, and added insult to injury by
walking off before his very eyes with another man. Accordingly,
he determined to write her a letter of remonstrance, and enlisted
the aid of Phineas and another young blade known as ""Bill""

following:

Kwairyō answered:—

"5._ you suggest, _That by your Engin, one Spinner may
earn 9_ d. _as easily as 6_ d. _without it; But how can that be? since
every Spinner now, may have a wheel to turn with her foot, and so have both
hands at liberty, as well as with your Engins: And again, its a more usual
fault to over-twist the thred, than to do it too slack; therefore no need
of help to turn the wheel._

_Answ._ To this I Answer, First, That the thing we chiefly design, is to
imploy and maintain such as cannot any other way earn half their living by
any other Imploy, so that more than half the Spinners would be very young,
and of little strength, and consequently to imploy one foot all the time
they Spin, will be very tiresome; nay, the strongest body cannot do it,
without easing the same, neither can they imply both hands so freely, as
when they are discharged of that burthen, or incumbrance. As for Example: Two men of equal strength, skill, and nimbleness in all
points, were to run a long Race, and one of them must carry such a weight
in his hand, as is more tiresome to him than the motion of his Legs, and
oft-times, must ease the Burthen with his foot: May not the other, who hath
all his Limbs free, be at the end of the Race and half-way back again as
soon, and more easily than this can get to the end of the Race. Possibly
some may say, _This Simile is not parallel, and that I make it better on my
side than it is_. To which I say, for the Resolution of this Question, Do
but inquire of those that Spin, which of the Two is most tiresome, The
turning of the Wheel, (either by the Foot or Hand, no matter which) or the
other part of the Work.",15102,1600s

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

"The fifth and
thirteenth, however, which are not comprehended in the Vatican collection,
are supplied from Hearne's work. Of the seventeen letters of which the
series consists, eight are written in English and nine in French. They appear to have been written after Anne Boleyn had been sent away from
court, in consequence of reports injurious to her reputation, which had
begun to be publicly circulated. Her removal indeed was so abrupt that she
had resolved never to return. The king soon repented his harshness, and
strove to persuade her to come back; but it was a long time, and not
without great trouble, before he could induce her to comply.",32155,1400s
"This was effected with so much glory, and struck such a panic into
the Florentines, that they were almost ready to raise the siege, and
actually retreated a distance of four miles; for their generals thought
that they would retire to winter quarters, it being now October, and
make no further attempt till the return of spring. When the discomfiture was known at Florence, the government was filled
with indignation; and, to impart fresh vigor to the enterprise, and
restore the reputation of their forces, they immediately appointed
Antonio Pucci and Bernardo del Neri commissaries, who, with vast sums of
money, proceeded to the army, and intimated the heavy displeasure of the
Signory, and of the whole city, if they did not return to the walls; and
what a disgrace, if so large an army and so many generals, having only
a small garrison to contend with, could not conquer so poor and weak
a place. They explained the immediate and future advantages that would
result from the acquisition, and spoke so forcibly upon the subject,
that all became anxious to renew the attack. They resolved, in the first
place, to recover the rampart upon the hill; and here it was evident how
greatly humanity, affability, and condescension influence the minds of
soldiers; for Antonio Pucci, by encouraging one and promising another,
shaking hands with this man and embracing that, induced them to proceed
to the charge with such impetuosity, that they gained possession of
the rampart in an instant. However, the victory was not unattended by
misfortune, for Count Antonio da Marciano was killed by a cannon shot.",2464,1400s

_Basilica_. But _Sozomen_ tells us, _Lib._ V. _Cap._ 5. That the Church

will say, perhaps, one cannot change one's nature; and that if a person

it, to a certain degree; and but to a certain degree; for though we
cannot totally change our nature, we may in a great measure correct it,
by reflection and philosophy; and some philosophy is a very necessary
companion in this world, where, even to the most fortunate, the chances
are greatly against happiness. I am not old enough, nor tenacious enough, to pretend not to understand

"From San Sebastian I travelled incognito to Tudela, where I was met by
the King's mule drivers and waited on by the alcade, who left his wand at
my chamber door and at his, entrance knelt and kissed the hem of my
garment. From thence I was conducted to Comes by fifty musketeers riding
upon asses, who were sent me by the Governor of Navarre. At Saragossa I
was taken for the King of England, and a large number of ladies, in over
two hundred carriages, came to pay me their respects. Thence I proceeded
to Vivaros, where I had rich presents from the Governor of Valencia. And
thence I sailed to Majorca, whose Governor met me with above one hundred
coaches of the Spanish nobility, and carried me to mass at the Cathedral,
where I saw thirty or forty ladies of quality of more than common charms;

"Our gang had found the girl
in the middle of the night and captured the kidnapper in an old Indian
cemetery the next night, and then we had had a very mysterious and
exciting time hunting for the ransom money in one of cuckoo-est places
in all the world to find money, and at last had found it in this very
old icehouse, and, as I told you, the money had been sewed up inside of
these great big fish which we’d been digging up and stuffing into the
gunny sack. In maybe another seven minutes we’d have had it all dug up and stuffed
into the gunny sack and would have been on our excited way back to
camp, but all of a startling sudden we heard that outboard motor
roaring in our direction from out on the lake and we knew that unless
we stepped on the gas, we wouldn’t even get all of us climbed out of
the opening and far enough away in the bushes not to be seen. “What’s the sense of being scared?” Dragonfly, the pop-eyed member of
our gang, asked me right after I’d ordered us all to get going quick. “The kidnapper’s caught and in jail, isn’t he?”

“Sure, but Old hook-nosed John Till’s running loose up here somewhere,”
I said--Old Hook-nose being a very fierce man who was the fierce

"Were others, too, who are also born with an
infirm constitution, to betake themselves to a regular life, as I
have done, they would attain the age of one hundred and upwards,
as will be my case. And this certainty of being able to live a great age is, in my
opinion, a great advantage, and highly to be valued; none being
sure to live even a single hour, except such as adhere to the
rules of temperance. This security of life is built on good and
true natural reasons, which can never fail; it being impossible in
the nature of things, that he, who leads a sober and regular life,
should breed any sickness, or die of an unnatural death, before
the time, at which it is absolutely impossible he should live. But
sooner he cannot die, as a sober life has the virtue to remove all
the usual causes of sickness, and sickness cannot happen without a
cause; which cause being removed, sickness is, likewise, removed; and
sickness being removed, an untimely and violent death must be
prevented. And there is no doubt, that temperance has the virtue and efficacy
to remove such causes; for since health and sickness, life and
death, depend on the good or bad quality of the humours, temperance
corrects their vicious tendencies, and renders them perfect, being
possessed of the natural power of making them unite and hold
together, so as to render them inseperable, and incapable of
alteration and fermenting; circumstances, which engender cruel
fevers, and end in death.",30660,1400s

"On none more plainly
than that kind of _Blattaria_ with the white Flower; where they are all
transparent, and growing both on the Stalk and Leaves of the _Flower_,
each shewing likewise its _Peduncle_ whereon it is erected. The use of the _Flower_, or the _Foliation_ whereof we now speak, (that
is, as to its private service) is for the protection of the Attire;
this, as its under, and the _Empalement_ as its upper Garments; as
likewise of the _Fruit_: The necessity of which Service, in some Cases,
by the different situation of the _Flower_ and _Fruit_, with respect to
each other, is evident; _Apples_, _Pears_, and several other _Fruits_,
standing behind or under the _Flower_; but _Cherries_, _Apricots_, and
divers others, within it; for these, being of a very tender and pulpous
Body, and withal putting forth with the colder part of the Spring, could
not weather it out against the Variations and Extremities of the Air, (as
those of a more solid _Parenchyma_ can) except lodged up within their
_Flowers_. And as the _Flower_ is serviceable to the safety of the _Fruit_, so
is it to its growth; _sc._ in its Infancy, or _Embryo_-estate; for
which purpose, as there is a Flower, so that Flower is greater or less,
according as the nature of the Fruit to which it belongs, and the plenty
of the _Sap_ by which the Fruit is fed, doth require. Thus, where the
young Fruit is of a solider constitution, and the ascent of the _Sap_
less copious, were there here no _Flower_ to promote the said ascent
thereof into the Fruit (in the manner as is effected by the Green Leaves)
it must needs pine and die, or prove less kindly. On the contrary, should
the Flower be over-large, it would not only promote the ascent of the
_Sap_ up to the Fruit, but being as yet over-proportionate to it, would
likewise it self exhaust the same _Sap_, as fast as ascendent; like a
greedy Nurse, that prepares the Meat for her Child, and then eats it up
her self.",58138,1600s

when he wished the King to understand that the Count de Marsan, brother
of M. Legrand, had attached himself to M. Chamillard, the then Minister,
he took the following means: “Sire,” said he, with an air of the utmost
simplicity, as if he had not the least notion of malice, “I wished to
change my wigmaker, and employ the one who is now the most in fashion;
but I could not find him, for M. de Marsan has kept him shut up in his
room for several days past, making wigs for his household, and for M. de
Chamillard’s friends.”

The adventures of Prince Emmanuel of Portugal are a perfect romance. His brother, the King, was desirous, it is said, at first, to have made
a priest and a Bishop of him; to this, however, he had an insuperable
objection, for he was in love. The King sent for him, and asked him if
it was true that he had really resolved not to enter the Church. On the
Prince’s replying in the affirmative, the King, his brother, struck him. The Prince said, “You are my King and my brother, and therefore I cannot
revenge myself as I ought upon you; but you have put an insult upon me
which I cannot endure, and you shall never again see me in the whole

"I never
did see ladies doin’ no sich; my old Missis nor Miss Marie never did,
and I don’t see no kinder need on ’t;” and Dinah stalked indignantly
about, while Miss Ophelia piled and sorted dishes, emptied dozens of
scattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle, sorted napkins,
table-cloths, and towels, for washing; washing, wiping, and arranging
with her own hands, and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly
amazed Dinah. “Lor now! if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do, dey an’t ladies,
nohow,” she said to some of her satellites, when at a safe hearing
distance. “I has things as straight as anybody, when my clarin’ up
times comes; but I don’t want ladies round, a henderin’, and getting my
things all where I can’t find ’em.”

To do Dinah justice, she had, at irregular periods, paroxyms of
reformation and arrangement, which she called “clarin’ up times,” when
she would begin with great zeal, and turn every drawer and closet wrong
side outward, on to the floor or tables, and make the ordinary
confusion seven-fold more confounded. Then she would light her pipe,
and leisurely go over her arrangements, looking things over, and
discoursing upon them; making all the young fry scour most vigorously
on the tin things, and keeping up for several hours a most energetic
state of confusion, which she would explain to the satisfaction of all
inquirers, by the remark that she was a “clarin’ up.” “She couldn’t hev
things a gwine on so as they had been, and she was gwine to make these
yer young ones keep better order;” for Dinah herself, somehow, indulged

"Therefore, if thou wilst find it convenient, we
shall visit thee, good father, on the fifth day from today.”

Spizo, the Spaniard, had seen De Montfort’s man leave the note with
Father Claude and he had seen the priest hide it under a great bowl on
his table, so that when the good father left his cottage, it was the
matter of but a moment’s work for Spizo to transfer the message from
its hiding place to the breast of his tunic. The fellow could not read,
but he to whom he took the missive could, laboriously, decipher the
Latin in which it was penned. The old man of Torn fairly trembled with suppressed rage as the full
purport of this letter flashed upon him. It had been years since he had
heard aught of the search for the little lost prince of England, and
now that the period of his silence was drawing to a close, now that
more and more often opportunities were opening up to him to wreak the
last shred of his terrible vengeance, the very thought of being
thwarted at the final moment staggered his comprehension. “On the fifth day,” he repeated.",369,1800s
"Of these, $880 thousands have been reserved for payment of
the first installment due under the British convention of January 8th,
1802, and $2 millions are what have been before mentioned as placed by
Congress under the power and accountability of the President toward the
price of New Orleans and other territories acquired, which, remaining
untouched, are still applicable to that object and go in diminution of
the sum to be funded for it. Should the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and
carried into effect, a sum of nearly $13 millions will then be added to
our public debt, most of which is payable after fifteen years, before
which term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the
established operation of the sinking fund. When we contemplate the
ordinary annual augmentation of impost from increasing population and
wealth, the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new
acquisition, and the economies which may still be introduced into our
public expenditures, I can not but hope that Congress in reviewing
their resources will find means to meet the intermediate interest of
this additional debt without recurring to new taxes, and applying to this
object only the ordinary progression of our revenue. Its extraordinary
increase in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund
for any measures of safety or precaution which that state of things may
render necessary in our neutral position. Remittances for the installments of our foreign debt having been found
practicable without loss, it has not been thought expedient to use the
power given by a former act of Congress of continuing them by reloans, and
of redeeming instead thereof equal sums of domestic debt, although no
difficulty was found in obtaining that accommodation.",5012,1700s

“Here is a shilling,” said Miss Wilson. “Now go.”

“You may keep the change.”

“You have a noble ‘art, lady; but you’re flying in the face of the law

"I enhanced the astonishment of some
and excited the ridicule of others, by observing that my dog not
only understood English when spoken by others, but actually spoke the
language himself, with no small degree of precision. This assertion could not be admitted without proof; proof, therefore,
was readily produced. At a known signal, Damon began a low interrupted
noise, in which the astonished hearers clearly distinguished English
words. A dialogue began between the animal and his master, which was
maintained, on the part of the former, with great vivacity and spirit. In this dialogue the dog asserted the dignity of his species and
capacity of intellectual improvement.",842,1700s
"By-and-by
I found myself beyond the garden, where the lawns ran to the fringe of

my memory drew it, it should have been peopled with strange
figures-nymphs dancing on the sward, and a prick-eared faun peeping
from the covert. In the warm afternoon sunlight it stood, ineffably
gracious and beautiful, tantalising with a sense of some deep hidden
loveliness. Very reverently I walked between the slim trees, to where
the little conical tower stood half in the sun and half in shadow.",715,1800s

"The Marines moved out at 0500 proceeding along two axes with the 1st

probing to their front with extended rifles much the same way a blind
man uses a walking cane. For that reason, Captain Dabney had placed
Second Lieutenant Harry F. Fromme's 1st Platoon and Second Lieutenant
Thomas D. Brindley's 3d Platoon in the lead because both units had
patrolled this area frequently and the commanders knew the terrain
like the back of their hands. In spite of this, by 0900 the entire
force had covered only a few hundred meters but then the fog began to
lift enabling the Marines to move out at a brisker pace. The company
swept out of the draw at the northern base of 881S, secured its first
intermediate objective without incident, and then advanced toward a
stretch of high ground which was punctuated by four innocent-looking
little hills.",54613,1900s
"But the most
considerable Instance I can give is, the Progress of Christianity, by
means of the civilized Disposition, and large Extent of the _Roman
Empire_. The latter of which, as it made way for human Power; so the
former made way for our most excellent Religion into the Minds of Men. And so I hope, and earnestly pray, that the Omnipotent and All-wise
Ruler of the World will transact the Affairs of our most Holy Religion,
e’er it be long, in the Heathen World; that the great Improvements made
in the last, and present Age, in Arts and Sciences, in Navigation and
Commerce, may be a Means to transport our Religion, as well as Name,
through all the Nations of the Earth. For we find that our Culture of the
more polite and curious Sciences, and our great Improvements in even the
Mechanick Arts, have already made a Way for us into some of the largest
and farthest distant Nations of the Earth; particularly into the great
Empire of _China_[cc]. And now, before I quit this Subject, I cannot but make one Remark, by way
of practical Inference, from what has been last said; and that is, Since
it appears that the Souls of Men are ordered, disposed and actuated by
God, even in secular, as well as spiritual Christian Acts; a Duty ariseth
thence on every Man, to pursue the Ends, and answer all the Designs of
the divine Providence, in bestowing his Gifts and Graces upon him.",75254,1600s
"In the Han period the provincial officials
had to propose suitable young persons for examination, and so for
admission to the state service, as was already mentioned. In addition,
schools had been instituted for the sons of officials; it is interesting
to note that there were, again and again, complaints about the low level
of instruction in these schools. Nevertheless, through these schools all
sons of officials, whatever their capacity or lack of capacity, could
become officials in their turn. In spite of its weaknesses, the system
had its good side. It inoculated a class of people with ideals that were
unquestionably of high ethical value.",11367,1900s

have saved a servant from movement. She made one to Fontainebleau when
it seemed not unlikely that she would die on the road! In whatever
condition she might be, the King went to her at his ordinary hour and did
what he had projected; though several times she was in bed, profusely
sweating away a fever. The King, who as I have said, was fond of air,
and feared warm rooms, was astonished upon arriving to find everything
close shut, and ordered the windows to be opened; would not spare them an

"Whilst proofs have been continued of the enterprise and skill of our
cruisers, public and private, on the ocean, and a trophy gained in the
capture of a British by an American vessel of war, after an action giving
celebrity to the name of the victorious commander, the great inland waters
on which the enemy were also to be encountered have presented achievements
of our naval arms as brilliant in their character as they have been
important in their consequences. On Lake Erie, the squadron under command of Captain Perry having met the
British squadron of superior force, a sanguinary conflict ended in the
capture of the whole. The conduct of that officer, adroit as it was daring,
and which was so well seconded by his comrades, justly entitles them to the
admiration and gratitude of their country, and will fill an early page in
its naval annals with a victory never surpassed in luster, however much it
may have been in magnitude. On Lake Ontario the caution of the British commander, favored by
contingencies, frustrated the efforts of the American commander to bring on
a decisive action. Captain Chauncey was able, however, to establish an
ascendancy on that important theater, and to prove by the manner in which
he effected everything possible that opportunities only were wanted for a
more shining display of his own talents and the gallantry of those under
his command.",5013,1700s

and I took a short stroll about the American quarter, finding on my
return that already, with the prompt courtesy which distinguishes this
country, several gentlemen had left cards of compliment and invitation. _Sunday, 4th._--A lovely day. Mr. B----e having planned a ride as far as
the lake, I saw after breakfast three or four good-looking horses
arrive, caparisoned with showy, coloured, housings and _demi-pique_
Spanish saddles: shortly after, their masters appeared, and off we
pushed through mud knee-deep; we soon gained the shell road however, and
found it as good as the streets of Mobile, hard, smooth, and binding as
lime. It is a pity, as this material is to be procured in abundance,
that it is not more generally applied: paving the streets with heavy
stones, which soon sink deep in the alluvial soil, is, I fear, likely,
without vast outlay, to prove labour lost; besides that these have to be
imported from the North or from England, not a pebble existing here over
the whole surface of the country.",23284,1700s
"Shepherdess, look on him better,
And be not proud. Though all the world could see,
None could be so abused in sight as he. Come, to our flock. [_Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and Corin._]

"in the North, p. 209. SECTION I. _Voyage and Shipwreck of Quirini_. On the 25th of April 1431, Pietro Quirini set sail from Candia, steering
westwards to the straits of Gibraltar; but, owing to contrary winds, he was
obliged to keep near the coast of Barbary. On the 2d of June, he passed the
straits, and, through the ignorance of the pilot, the ship got upon the
shoals of St Peter, in consequence of which accident the rudder was thrown
off the hinges, and the ship admitted water in three several places;
insomuch that it was with great difficulty they could save the vessel from
sinking, and get her into Cadiz.",10600,1700s

"For the Just God cut them off before
they did much Mischief, and reserv'd the Castigation and Revenge of
those Evils which I know, and was an Eye-Witness of, to this very Time
and Place. As to the Fourth Tyrant, who lately, that is, in the Year
1538, came hither well-furnished with Men and Ammunition, we have
received no account these Three Years last past; but wer are very
confident, that he, at his first Arrival, acted like a bloody Tyrant,
even to extasie and madness, if he be still alive with his Follower,
and did injure, destroy, and consume a vast Number of Men (for he was
branded with infamous Cruelty above all those who with their Assistants
committed Crimes and Enormities of the first Magnitude in these
Kingdoms and Provinces) I conceive, God hath punished him with the same
Violent Death, as he did other Tyrants: But because my Pen is wearied
with relating such Execrable and Sanguinary Deeds (not of Men but
Beasts) I will trouble my self no longer with the dismal and fatal
Consequences thereof. These People were found by them to be Wise, Grave, and well dispos'd,
though their usual Butcheries and Cruelties in opressing them like
Brutes, with heavy Burthens, did rack their minds with great Terror and
Anguish. At their Entry into a certain Village, they were welcomed
with great Joy and Exultation, replenished them with Victuals, till
they were all satisfied, yielding up to them above Six Hundred Men to
carry their Bag and Baggage, and like Grooms to look after their
Horses: The _Spaniards_ departing thence, a Captain related to the
Superiour Tyrant returned thither to rob this (no ways diffident or
mistrustful) People, and pierced their King through with a Lance, of
which Wound he dyed upon the Spot, and committed several other
Cruelties into the bargain. In another Neighboring Town, whose
Inhabitants they thought, were more vigilant and watchful, having had
the News of their horrid Acts and Deeds, they barbarously murdered them
all with their Lances and Swords, destroying all, Young and Old, Great
and Small, Lords and Subject without exception.",20321,1400s
"May I be so converted, and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but
love may transform me to an oyster; but I'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a
fool. One woman is fair; yet I am well: another is wise; yet I am
well: another virtuous; yet I am well: but till all graces be in
one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall
be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never
cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an
excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it
please God. Ha, the prince and monsieur Love!",1520,1500s

"Foolishly, I expected to discover Incan artifacts. The crumbled red
stones should have warned me. They were, I think, harder than metal,
yet they had been here long enough for the elements to erode them into
featureless shards. Had they been of earthly origin they would have

"The Juchên had
gained great agrarian regions in a rapid march of conquest. Once more
great cities with a huge urban population and immense wealth had fallen
to alien conquerors. Now the Juchên wanted to enjoy this wealth as the
Kitan had done before them. All the Juchên people counted as citizens of
the highest class; they were free from taxation and only liable to
military service. They were entitled to take possession of as much
cultivable land as they wanted; this they did, and they took not only
the ""state domains"" actually granted to them but also peasant
properties, so that Chinese free peasants had nothing left but the worst
fields, unless they became tenants on Juchên estates.",17695,1900s
"The consideration of the
articles he makes use of, does not in sound estimate detract from the
glories of which he is the artificer. Materiem superat opus. He changes
the nature of what he handles; all that he touches is turned into
gold. The manufacture he delivers to us is so new, that the thing it
previously was, is no longer recognisable. The impression that he makes
upon the imagination and the heart, the impulses that he communicates to
the understanding and the moral feeling, are all his own; and, ""if there

"The revenues of the Hotel de Ville, which are, as it were, the patrimony
of the bourgeois, and which, if well managed, might be of special service
to the King in securing to his interest an infinite number of those
people who are always the most formidable in revolutions--this sacred
fund, I say, suffered much by the licentiousness of the times, the
ignorance of Mazarin, and the prevarication of the officers of the Hotel
de Ville, who were his dependents, so that the poor annuitants met in
great numbers at the Hotel de Ville; but as such assemblies without the
Prince's authority are reckoned illegal, the Parliament passed a decree
to suppress them. They were privately countenanced by M. de Beaufort and
me, to whom they sent a solemn deputation, and they made choice of twelve
syndics to be a check upon the 'prevot des marchands'. On the 11th of December a pistol, as had been concerted beforehand, was
fired into the coach of Joly, one of the syndics, which President
Charton, another of the syndics, thinking was aimed at himself, the
Marquis de la Boulaie ran as if possessed with a devil, while the
Parliament was sitting, into the middle of the Great Hall, with fifteen
or twenty worthless fellows crying out ""To Arms!"" He did the like in the
streets, but in vain, and came to Broussel and me; but the former
reprimanded him after his way, and I threatened to throw him out at the
window, for I had reason to believe that he acted in concert with the
Cardinal, though he pretended to be a Frondeur. This artifice of Servien united the Prince to the Cardinal, because he
found himself obliged to defend himself against the Frondeurs, who, as he
believed, sought to assassinate him.",3844,1600s
"But
this officer of the crown, and this truant American in particular,
are fairly our prisoners; as such, they must be conducted on board our
ship.”

“But the main object of our expedition?” said Griffith. “'Tis lost,” returned the Pilot, hastily--“'tis sacrificed to more
private feelings; 'tis like a hundred others, ended in disappointment,
and is forgotten, sir, forever. But the interests of the Republics must
not be neglected, Mr. Griffith.--Though we are not madly to endanger
the lives of those gallant fellows, to gain a love-smile from one young
beauty, neither are we to forget the advantages they may have obtained
for us, in order to procure one of approbation from another. This
Colonel Howard will answer well in a bargain with the minions of the
Crown, and may purchase the freedom of some worthy patriot who is
deserving of his liberty.",7974,1700s
"Bid them come swiftly if they would see the doctoress Nombé
before she dies.”

The man leapt off like a buck, and within a few minutes I saw Heda and
Anscombe running towards us, half dressed, and went to meet them. “What is it?” she gasped. “I have only time to tell you this,” I answered. “Nombé is dying. She
gave her life to save you, how I will explain afterwards.",1724,1800s
"The velum interpositum was very firm; the plexus choroides
uncommonly thick, but pale; the opening from the right to the left
ventricle large. The vessels of the brain were generally not much
filled with blood. The blood appeared every where fluid, except in some portions of the
lungs, and in the cavities of the heart. It was very dark coloured,
perhaps more than ordinarily thin, and oozed from every part, which
was cut. The cellular membrane, in all dependent parts, effused, when cut, a
serous fluid.",26836,1700s
"Since then the origin of marriage love is the marriage of good and
truth, which marriage in its essence is heaven, it is clear that the
origin of the love of adultery is a marriage of evil and falsity, which
in its essence is hell. Heaven is a marriage because all who are in the
heavens are in a marriage of good and truth; and hell is adultery
because all who are in the hells are in a marriage of evil and falsity. From this it follows that marriage and adultery are as opposite as
heaven and hell are. (A.E., n. 983.)",14026,1600s

"And you see, my dear, what these
men are--no sooner do they find that you have favoured them with the
power of doing you an agreeable service, but they take upon them to
approve, forsooth, of your actions! By which is implied a right to
disapprove, if they think fit. I have told my mother how much you wish to be reconciled to your
relations, and how independent you are upon Lovelace. Mark the end of the latter assertion, she says. And as to
reconciliation, she knows that nothing will do, (and will have it, that

"The seventy Iroquois
returned southward, following the River
Richelieu, Lake Champlain, and Lake George, en
route for the Mohawk towns. Meeting a war
party of two hundred of their own nation on
one of the islands of Champlain, the Indians
formed two parallel lines between which the
captives were forced to run for their lives, while
the savages struck at them with thorny sticks
and clubs. Father Jogues fell exhausted to the
ground, bathed in his own blood, when fire was
applied to his body. At night the young
warriors tormented the poor captives by opening
their wounds and tearing out their hair and
beards. The day following this night of torture
the Indians and their mangled captives reached
the promontory of Ticonderoga, along the base
of which flowed the limpid waters, the outlet of
Lake George.",1082,1800s

"Lastly, did this Objection carry any
weight in it, then neither Physicians, Chirurgeons, Apothecaries,
Nurses, nor Friends, might administer to the sick; because all these,
as well as Physicians, may clandestinely poyson their Relations. And
therefore that an Objection should be raised by such persons that have
more opportunities and advantage (in a thing never proved to be done,
because 'tis possible only) to hinder so manifest and publick a profit
as hath been proved; appears to be very weak and absurd. And having done with the Objections made to others, and to my self
also by some of the Company, with whom I have conversed, who huff'd
exceedingly at my first discourse with them, but departed (seemingly
at least) well satisfied, I am sure fully and without reply answered,
and with addition of many other Cheats besides, which I shall not here
mention for the reasons above specified: I shall here transcribe one
gratulatory Letter amongst many sent me by a Divine well known in
Physic, being very comprehensive of most I have said, to the end the
Universities and all learned men may see what is like to become of one
of the three of their noble professions: The words of the Letter are
these. ""Your design all ingenious persons approve highly, to whom I have
  communicated it. 'Tis frequent with a Master Apothecary that hath
  served but 2, or 3 years, nay some scarce one, to take Apprentices
  for as little, or less time, with a little more money then
  ordinarily; and presently they assume the Title of Doctors, though
  they understand no more then only to write to a whole-sale
  Apothecary in your City.",15910,1600s
"Wherefore He does
not mean this, that these fruits are the price, or are the
propitiation, because of which the remission of sins, which
reconciles us to God, is given. We are disputing concerning a great
subject, concerning the honor of Christ, and whence good minds may
seek for sure and firm consolation whether confidence is to be placed
in Christ or in our works. Now, if it is to be placed in our works,
the honor of Mediator and Propitiator will be withdrawn from Christ. And yet we shall find, in God's judgment, that this confidence is
vain, and that consciences rush thence into despair. But if the
remission of sins and reconciliation do not occur freely for Christ's
sake, but for the sake of our love, no one will have remission of
sins, unless when he has fulfilled the entire Law, because the Law
does not justify as long as it can accuse us.",6744,1400s

"Gontran, a relation of the Count, accused the Countess of
having murdered her husband, to whom, he asserted, she had long been
unfaithful, and challenged her to produce a champion to do battle in her
behalf, that he might establish her guilt by killing him. [Memoires
de Brantome touchant les Duels.] All the friends and relatives of the
Countess believed in her innocence; but Gontran was so stout and bold
and renowned a warrior, that no one dared to meet him, for which, as
Brantome quaintly says, ""Mauvais et poltrons parens estaient."" The
unhappy Countess began to despair, when a champion suddenly appeared
in the person of Ingelgerius, Count of Anjou, a boy of sixteen years
of age, who had been held by the Countess on the baptismal font, and
received her husband's name. He tenderly loved his godmother, and
offered to do battle in her cause against any and every opponent.",636,1800s
"If only some of his relatives
had been present at his death! He would not have cared to hear the sobs
and anguish of his poor, weak mother, nor the unreasoning cries of a
wife, tearing her hair and beating her white breast; but he would have
liked to see a strong man who might refresh him with a word of wisdom,
and cheer his end. And his strength failed him, and he cried in the
weakness of his soul, “Father! where are you? do you hear?”

“I hear!” rang through the universal silence, and those thousands of
people shuddered in concert.",1197,1800s
"He therefore, without much
hesitation, embraced the proposal of his kinsman, and, as he observed,
was, in less than a month after his discharge, turned adrift to the
mercy of the wind and waves. Since that period he had never maintained any correspondence with his
relations, all of whom had concurred in sending him off; nor would he
ever pay the least regard to the humiliations and supplications of some
among them, who had prostrated themselves before him, on the advancement
of his fortune: but he retained a most inveterate resentment against
his uncle, who was still in being, though extremely old and infirm, and
frequently mentioned his name with all the bitterness of revenge. Perry being perfectly well acquainted with the particulars of this
story, which he had heard so often repeated, proposed to Hatchway that
a person should be hired to introduce himself to the commodore, with a
supposititious letter of recommendation from this detested kinsman; an
imposition that, in all likelihood, would afford abundance of diversion. The lieutenant relished the scheme and young Pickle having composed an
epistle for the occasion, the exciseman of the parish, a fellow of great
impudence and some humour, in whom Hatchway could confide, undertook to
transcribe and deliver it with his own hand, and also personate the
man in whose favour it was feigned to be written. He, accordingly, one
morning arrived on horseback at the garrison, two hours at least
before Trunnion used to get up, and gave Pipes, who admitted him, to
understand, that he had a letter from his master, which he was ordered
to deliver to none but the commodore himself.",4084,1700s
"All the old
people cared for me especially, and I was kept often in the parlor,
and, when I was cold, the children were allowed to sit upon me, but
never to abuse me. But this is a capricious, changing, cheating, vain
world, and foot stoves are not thought much of nowadays. The churches
are warmed all over, so that foot stoves are not needed, and so I never
go to church; indeed, in my broken-down state of health, it would
hardly be safe for me to do so. I am not even used at home, if it is
possible to do without me: and then, if I ever am brought down stairs,
a long apology is made for my looks. The truth is, my life has not been a happy or desirable one.",4033,1700s
"Nevertheless, no disrespect was shown either to the King’s brother or to
M. le Prince; only some in their presence cried out, “God bless M. de
Beaufort! God bless the Coadjutor!”

M. de Beaufort told the First President next day that, the State and
royal family being in danger, every moment was precious, and that the
offenders ought to receive condign punishment, and that therefore the
Chambers ought to be assembled without loss of time. Broussel attacked
the First President with a great deal of warmth. Eight or ten
councillors entered immediately into the Great Chamber to testify their
astonishment at the indolence and indifference of the House after such a
furious conspiracy, and that so little zeal was shown to prosecute the
criminals. MM.",3846,1600s
"Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross’d. But on this day let seamen fear no wrack;
No bargains break that are not this day made;
This day, all things begun come to ill end,
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change! KING PHILIP. By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day. Have I not pawn’d to you my majesty?",1511,1500s
"But, whether she be loved or neglected, her first
wish should be to make herself respectable, and not rely for all
her happiness on a being subject to like infirmities with herself. The amiable Dr. Gregory fell into a similar error. I respect his
heart; but entirely disapprove of his celebrated Legacy to his
Daughters. He advises them to cultivate a fondness for dress, because a
fondness for dress, he asserts, is natural to them. I am unable to
comprehend what either he or Rousseau mean, when they frequently
use this indefinite term.",3420,1700s
"Serve always with assured trust,
And in thy suit be humble, true;
Unless thy lady prove unjust,
Press never thou to choose anew:
  When time shall serve, be thou not slack
  To proffer, though she put thee back. The wiles and guiles that women work,
Dissembled with an outward show,
The tricks and toys that in them lurk,
The cock that treads them shall not know. Have you not heard it said full oft,
  A woman's nay doth stand for naught? Think women still to strive with men,
To sin, and never for to saint:
There is no heaven, by holy then,
When time with age doth them attaint. Were kisses all the joys in bed,

"Jupiter addressed the assembly. He set forth the
frightful condition of things on the earth, and closed by
announcing his intention to destroy the whole of its inhabitants,
and provide a new race, unlike the first, who would be more
worthy of life, and much better worshippers of   the gods. So
saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the
world, and destroy it by burning it; but recollecting the danger
that such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he
changed his plan, and resolved to drown the world. Aquilo, the
north wind, which scatters the clouds, was chained up; Notus, the
south, was sent out, and soon covered all the face of heaven with
a cloak of pitchy darkness. The clouds, driven together, resound
with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are laid low; the
year's labor of the husbandman perishes in an hour.",3327,1700s
"[Sidenote: _America_ was Peopled presently after the Flood.] [Sidenote: Giants in _America_.] [Sidenote: _Conjurati fratres_, _Virg. Georg._]

[Sidenote: The Flood acknowledg’d there.] Although from the foremention’d places, and after the same manner,
_America_ might be furnish’d with Inhabitants; so it also gives us a
more certain assurance, that the Planting of _America_ was not onely
soon after the Flood, but that they came also thither by Land: And how
strangely would it be against the Majesty and Wisdom of Divine
Providence, to leave half the Universal Globe, a World fully supply’d
with all sorts of Creatures, fit for Food and Service, Plants, Herbs,
and the richest Minerals, like a House new built, and well furnish’d,
without a Master or any Inhabitant, _viz._ Man, who being of Celestial
Extract, should be able to acknowledge and glorifie the Creator, by
admiring the Creature in his great Works: Besides, the confus’d Notions
and Fables of Giants, Perpetrators of all manner of Crimes, and
wallowing in all kind of sensual Debaucheries, are always remembred
among the Antiquities of the _Americans_, and that they had some slender
hints of antient Truth, not onely of the Giants before the Flood, but of
those that soon after the rank fatness of the Earth, produc’d and fed to
that pitch of Arrogance, that the covenanting Brethren defi’d God,
fortifying themselves to fight him by the advantage of that their long
congested Pile, _Babel_, which in a short time was transverted by the
_Heathen_ Poets into their _Gigantomachia_, heaping Hills on Hills, like
the _American_ Traditions: From which we may conjecture, that they came
thither in the time of _Noah_; for why may not any believe, when _Noah_
liv’d three hundred years after he Landed on Mount _Ararat_, that he
took care to People the World?",59745,1600s
"CHAP. VII. In the evening he took leave of Mr. Martin's family, with a very sorrowful
heart, and set off for Mr. Laurie's. When he reached the house, the maid
bade him come in and sit down near the fire. The other servants began to
assemble, and in about ten minutes the supper was ready.",7963,1700s
"Mayhem would want to
board that ship."" ""It's funny, we've been working with Mayhem all these years and we never
even met the guy."" ""Would you know him if you saw him?"" ""Umm-mm, I guess not. Do you think we really can halt his _elan_ in

"Liberty results, we say, from the government of laws; and we are apt to
consider statutes, not merely as the resolutions and maxims of a people
determined to be free, not as the writings by which their rights are kept
on record; but as a power erected to guard them, and as a barrier which the
caprice of man cannot transgress. When a basha, in Asia, pretends to decide every controversy by the rules of
natural equity, we allow that he is possessed of discretionary powers. When
a judge in Europe is left to decide, according to his own interpretation of
written laws, is he in any sense more restrained than the former? Have the
multiplied words of a statute an influence over the conscience and the
heart, more powerful than that of reason and nature? Does the party, in any
judicial proceeding, enjoy a less degree of safety, when his rights are
discussed, on the foundation of a rule that is open to the understandings
of mankind, than when they are referred to an intricate system, which it
has become the object of a separate profession to study and to explain?",8646,1700s

REMARK I. According to the above State of the Account, the Sum Total of the Value of
the Exports to _Holland_ and _Germany_ alone, during a Period of nine
Years, exceeded that to all the [present revolted] Provinces of _North
America_, by no less than 10,234,103_l._ 7_s._ 7_d._ which is more than
ONE-THIRD of the Whole. And yet this very Period was more favourable to
_American_ Exports than any other: 1st. Because during this Period, there
was the greatest Emigration from _Europe_ to _America_, and particularly
from _Holland_ and _Germany_, that can be remembered; and each Emigrant,
if a Customer to _England_, whilst resident in _Europe_, not only swells
the _American_ Account by his Removal, but also sinks the _European_: So
that he acts in a double Capacity, by adding Weight to one Scale, and by
substracting, at least an equal, if not a greater, from the other:--2dly,
Because During this Period, the Colonists, and more especially the four
_New-England_ Governments, were preparing for a _Non-Importation_ System;
and therefore were storing their Magazines with great Quantities of Goods
to serve for many Years. This Circumstance appears on the very Face of
the Account:--And 3dly, Because the Business of Commercial PUFFING, during
this Period, was carried, by the Partizans of _America_, to a greater
Height than ever, in order to make the _American_ Trade appear to be of
much more Consequence to this Nation, than it really is.--To explain this
Artifice of Commercial _Puffing_, to such Persons, who are not conversant
in the Progress of Commercial Laws, I must beg their Attention to the
following short Narrative.--Formerly the Kings of _England_ established
certain Duties or Taxes (generally five per Cent.",32557,1700s

Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to insure the
stability and security of this critical region. Let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability and security. We do
not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture or its people.",5047,1900s

"I made a
reflection this time on my extreme imprudence, and understood that all
the generosities of love are often no more than loans. I noticed amongst
my jewels a goblet of gold, wrought with diamonds and rubies, which came
from the first of the Medici princesses. I waited for the King's fete to
return this magnificent ornament to him nobly. I had a lily executed,
all of emeralds and fine pearls; I poured essence of roses into the cup,
placed in it the stem of the lily, in the form of a bouquet for the
prince, and that was my present for Saint Louis's day. I gave back to the King, by degrees, at least three millions' worth of
important curiosities, which were like drops of water poured into the
ocean.",3853,1600s
"For, as nothing can
be so criminal but that circumstances might be added by the imagination
to make it worse; so nothing can be conceived so wicked and offensive to
the feelings of a good mind, as not to be somewhat softened or
extenuated by circumstances and motives. In making up a just estimate of
any human action, much will depend on the state of the agent's mind at
the time; and therefore the laws of all countries make ample allowance
for insanity. The insane are not held to be responsible for their
actions. The world will give me credit, surely, for having had sufficient
opportunities of knowing a good deal of female characters. I have seen
the private as well as the public virtues, the private as well as the
more public frailties of women in all ranks of life.",26870,1700s

"I shall take no Notice
of _Babylon_ in _Assyria_, who, when she was in her most flourishing
State, had the Mortification to see a City built near her, equal in
Largeness to her self: Why is not _Alexandria_ rebuilt, but because
she must support her self more by the Industry of her People, than the
Agreeableness of her Situation? ’Twas the Sanctity of St. _Peter_,
and the Grandeur of the _Roman_ Name, that contributed more to the
rebuilding old _Rome_, than the natural Situation of the Place itself,
as having no Convenience for Ships and Harbours. I pass by in Silence
_Athens_ and _Lacedæmon_, which were more remarkable for the Learning
and resolute Bravery of their People, than the Situation of their
City. I omit the two Eyes of the Sea Coast, _Corinth_ and _Carthage_,
both which falling into Ruins at the same Time, were first repaired by
_Julius Cæsar_; afterwards, when they fell entirely to decay, nobody
rebuilt them: And though _Carthage_ is seated in a _Peninsula_ with
several Havens about it, yet in no part of it are there two Seas which
fall into each other: For though _Corinth_ may be said to lie between
two Seas, and is call’d the Fort of _Peloponnesus_, the Key and Door
of _Greece_; yet is it so far from uniting in one Chanel two Seas, or
two Bays adjoining to the _Peninsula_, that she was never able to make
Head against the _Macedonians_ or _Romans_, as _Cyzico_ and _Negropont_
did; the one by its well built Forts and other War-like Means, and the
other by the Strength of its natural Situation. But _Constantinople_
is the Key both of the _Mediterranean_ and _Black Sea_, which alone,
by the best Skill in Navigation, nay though you were to make a Voyage
round the World, you will find to meet only in one Point, and that is,
the Mouth of the Port.",53083,1400s
"Neptune was angry that he gave no ear,
And in his heart revenging malice bare. He flung at him his mace but, as it went,
He called it in, for love made him repent. The mace, returning back, his own hand hit
As meaning to be venged for darting it. When this fresh bleeding wound Leander viewed,
His colour went and came, as if he rued
The grief which Neptune felt. In gentle breasts
Relenting thoughts, remorse, and pity rests.",18781,1500s

"Bramah's first
invention with this object was his Hydrostatic Machine, founded on the
doctrine of the equilibrium of pressure in fluids, as exhibited in the
well known 'hydrostatic paradox.' In his patent of 1785, in which he no
longer describes himself as Cabinet maker, but 'Engine maker' of
Piccadilly, he indicated many inventions, though none of them came into
practical use,--such as a Hydrostatical Machine and Boiler, and the
application of the power produced by them to the drawing of carriages,
and the propelling of ships by a paddle-wheel fixed in the stern of the
vessel, of which drawings are annexed to the specification; but it was
not until 1795 that he patented his Hydrostatic or Hydraulic Press. Though the principle on which the Hydraulic Press is founded had long
been known, and formed the subject of much curious speculation, it
remained unproductive of results until a comparatively recent period,
when the idea occurred of applying it to mechanical purposes. A
machine of the kind was indeed proposed by Pascal, the eminent
philosopher, in 1664, but more than a century elapsed before the
difficulties in the way of its construction were satisfactorily
overcome. Bramah's machine consists of a large and massive cylinder,
in which there works an accurately-fitted solid piston or plunger.",404,1800s

"Sunk in indolence and pleasure, these
inheritors of a glorious name hardly attempted for a moment to defend
their all but impregnable island, against the fleet which covered the
seas around them. The Parisian authorities had tampered successfully
beforehand with some of the French knights. Division of counsels
prevailed: and in confusion and panic the gates were thrown open. As
Napoleon was entering between the huge rocky barriers of La Valette,
Caffarelli said to him: ""It is well there was some one within to open
the door for us; had there been no garrison at all, the business might
have been less easy."" From Malta--where he left a detachment of troops to guard an acquisition
which he expected to find eminently useful in his future communications
with France--Buonaparte steered eastwards; but, after some days, ran
upon the coast of Candia to take in water and fresh provisions, and, by
thus casually diverging from his course, escaped imminent danger.",17579,1700s

at first to accustom myself to it."" As Brother Lawrence had found such an advantage in walking in the presence
of God, it was natural for him to recommend it earnestly to others. More
strikingly, his example was a stronger inducement than any arguments he

"In an instant she herself became
an eagle--pied, black and white--and, spreading her wings, leaped into
the air. For a while the two eagles circled around and around; but at last they
dashed against one another, and, grappling with their talons, tumbled
over and over until they struck the ground close to the two who stood
looking. Then the prince snatched the knife from the ground and ran to where they
lay struggling. “Which was I to kill?” said he to the old man. “Are they not birds of a feather?” cried the foster-father.",1751,1800s

"By means of this contrivance, I shall endeavour
to entertain you with with matters of the greatest moment. It is
true, that I shall speak of nothing but what I have already
mentioned; but it was not at the age of ninety-one, to which I have
now attained; a thing I cannot help taking notice of, because as I
advance in years, the sounder and heartier I grow, to the amazement
of all the world. I, who can account for it, am bound to shew, that
a many may enjoy a terrestrial paradise after eighty; which I enjoy;
but it is not to be obtained except by temperance and sobriety,
virtues so acceptable to the Almighty, because they are enemies to
sensuality, and friends to reason. Now, my lord, to begin, I must tell you, that, within these few days
past, I have been visited by many of the learned doctors of this
university, as well physicians and philosophers, who were well
acquainted with my age, my life, and manners; knowing how stout,
hearty, and gay I was; and in what perfection all my faculties still
continued; likewise my memory, spirits, and understanding; and even
my voice and teeth. They knew, besides, that I constantly employed
eight hours every day in writing treatises, with my own hand, on
subjects useful to mankind, and spent many hours in walking and
singing.",30660,1400s

comparing it with the name which is signed to the two wills, I would
say it more closely resembles the signature on the document already

like. However, if it should be proven that the signature on your will

"THE BLUE CHAMBER



I rose up, and said that I would sleep in the Blue Chamber. Before I tell you my own story, however--the story of what happened
in the Blue Chamber--I would wish to preface it with -



A PERSONAL EXPLANATION



I feel a good deal of hesitation about telling you this story of my
own. You see it is not a story like the other stories that I have
been telling you, or rather that Teddy Biffles, Mr. Coombes, and my
uncle have been telling you:  it is a true story. It is not a
story told by a person sitting round a fire on Christmas Eve,
drinking whisky punch:  it is a record of events that actually
happened. Indeed, it is not a 'story' at all, in the commonly accepted
meaning of the word:  it is a report.",1993,1800s
"In the light of this construction we can understand why
the mystical adept went in search of a wise woman with whom the work
could be performed; but few there be that find her, and he confessed to
his own failure. The part of woman in the physical practice of alchemy
is like a reflection at a distance of this more exalted process, and
there is evidence that those who worked in metals and sought for a
material elixir knew that there were other and greater aspects of the
Hermetic mystery. ""(1b)

"But soon
  A sharp and clashing noise the stillness broke,
  And from the evil lethargy I woke. The angel's wings had fallen, stone on stone,               25
    And lay there shattered; hence the sudden sound:
  A warrior leaning on his sword alone
    Now watched the sphinx with that regard profound;
  The sphinx unchanged looked forthright, as aware
  Of nothing in the vast abyss of air. 30

  Again I sank in that repose unsweet,
    Again a clashing noise my slumber rent;
  The warrior's sword lay broken at his feet:
    An unarmed man with raised hands impotent
  Now stood before the sphinx, which ever kept                35
  Such mien as if open eyes it slept. My eyelids sank in spite of wonder grown;
    A louder crash upstartled me in dread:
  The man had fallen forward, stone on stone,
    And lay there shattered, with his trunkless head          40
  Between the monster's large quiescent paws,
  Beneath its grand front changeless as life's laws. The moon had circled westward full and bright,
    And made the temple-front a mystic dream,
  And bathed the whole enclosure with its light,              45
    The sworded angel's wrecks, the sphinx supreme:
  I pondered long that cold majestic face
  Whose vision seemed of infinite void space.",1238,1800s
"It was on this choice of
situations, that the understanding whole pieces, both tragic and
comic, executed in dances, entirely depends. And here, upon mentioning the pantomime art, be it allowed me
to defend it against the objections made to it, by those who
consider it only under a partial or vulgar point of view. If any one should pretend that the pantomime art is superior to
the actor's power of representation in tragedy or comedy, or
that such an entertainment of dumb show ought to exclude that of
speaking characters; nothing could be more ridiculous or absurd
than such a proposition. That indeed would be rejecting one of the most noble
improvements of nature, in favor of an art rather calculated for
the relaxation of the mind than for the instruction of it; in
which it can only claim a subordinate share. Those subjects, whether serious or comic, which are executed by
dances, or in the pantomime strain, are chiefly intended for the
throwing a variety into theatrical entertainments, without
disputing any honors of rank.",24643,1700s
"In the general we are certified, that they were
very injurious and bloody to them; but they being far distant from
those _Indians_, we frequently discourse of, wer are not able to give
you a particular account of their Transactions. Yet beyond all
Controversie, they did, and still do go the same way to work, as others
in several Regions to this present time do, and have done; for they are
the same, (and many in number too) _Spaniards_ who went thither, that
were the wicked Instruments of other Executions, and all of them aim at
one and the same thing, namely to grow Rich and Wealthy, which they can
never be, unless they steer the same Course which others have followed,
and tread the same paths in Murdering, Robbing and Destroying poor
_Indians_. After I had committed to Writing what I have prementioned, it was told
me for a great Truth, that they had laid waste in those Countreys great
Kingdoms and Provinces, dealing Cruelly and Bloodily with these
harmless People, at a horrid rate, having a greater Opportunity and
Convenience to be more Infamous and Rigid to them, then others, they
being very remote from _Spain_, living inordinatly, like Debauches,
laying aside, and bidding farewel to all manner of Justice, which is
indeed a Stranger in all the _American_ Regions, as is manifest by what
hath been said already. But among the other Numerous Wicked Acts
following this is one that may be read in the _Indians_ Courts. One of
the Governours commanded his Soldiers to go to a certain Village, and
if they denyed them Provisions, to put all the Inhabitants to the
Sword: By Vertue of this Authority away they march, and because they
would not yield to them above Five Thousand Men as Enemies, fearing
rather to be seen, then guilty of Illiberality, were cut off by the
Sword.",20321,1400s
"“Sure, sure,” said Holton, looking at his plate with distaste. Kuppelton ordered veal and Marjorie left. Kuppelton looked at Ruth. She was dark, with a big nose and with
self-pitying eyes. Her complexion was oily and she wore too much
make-up.",66940,1900s
"I feared he might stop talking and
realize that I was the only witness to his confession of murder. ""What
does your talk of ink and deadlines mean?"" I asked. ""Do you write, too?"" ""The garden is only my life,"" the gardener said.",73937,1900s
"Be that as it will, I would not act like them. I rather coveted to live these ten years, and, had I not done so,
I should never have finished those tracts, which I have composed
in consequence of my having been sound and hearty these ten years
past; and which I have the pleasure to think will be of service to
others. These sensualists add, that a regular life is such as no
man can lead. To this I answer, Galen, who was so great a
physician, led such a life, and chose it as the best physic. The
same did Plato, Cicero, Isocrates, and many other great men of
former times; whom, not to tire the reader, I shall forbear naming:
and, in our own days, pope Paul Farnese led it, and cardinal Bembo;
and it was for that reason they lived so long; likewise our two
doges, Lando and Donato; besides many others of meaner condition,
and those who live not only in cities, but also in different parts
of the country, who all found great benefit by conforming to this
regularity.",30660,1400s

gain his affection, and formed with him a perpetual alliance for their
mutual defense. Lorenzo returned to Florence, and upon presenting

"Then I entertained a profound respect for Grace;
something more than the tenderness of a brother for a sister; for,
mingled with my strong affection for her, was a deference, a species
of awe of her angel-like character and purity, that made me far more
disposed to receive advice from her, than to bestow it. In the frame of
mind which was natural to all these blended feelings, I laid my hand on
the old-fashioned brass latch, by which the door of the “triangle”
 was closed. On entering the room, I found my sister seated on the
“causeuses,” the window open to admit air, the room looking snug but
cheerful, and its occupant's sweet countenance expressive of care, not
altogether free from curiosity. The last time I had been in that room,
it was to look on the pallid features of my mother's corpse, previously
to closing the coffin. All the recollections of that scene rushed upon
our minds at the same instant; and taking a place by the side of Grace,
I put an arm around her waist, drew her to me, and, receiving her head
on my bosom, she wept like a child.",8647,1700s

conversation of which I have been speaking, I took my best leave of my
inestimable friend, after attending him some part of his way northward. The first stage of our journey was to the cottage of that poor but
religious family which I had before occasion to mention as relieved, and
indeed in a great measure subsisted by his charity. Nothing could be more
delightful than to observe the condescension with which he conversed with
these his humble pensioners. We there put up our last united prayers

heard him use on such an occasion, the singular pleasure with which he
had joined in them.",11253,1700s

"A single stone is a thing worthy of admiration, but the
boldness and great relievo of the whole _compages_, can only be rightly
apprehended, from view of the original. On the outside, the imposts
are rounded a little to humour the curvity of the circle, and within
they are strait, tho’ they ought to be a little curv’d. This makes
them somewhat broader in the middle, than at the end, and broader
than the 2 cubits, which is the thickness of the upright stones, upon
an ichnography. So that within, the crown-work makes a polygon of 30
sides. But this little artifice without debasing the beauty of the
work in the least, adds much strength to the whole, and to the imposts
in particular.",61567,1600s

latter was defeated by the Bavarian general near Wimpfen (1622). To defend a king whom his nearest relation persecuted, and who was
deserted even by his own father-in-law, there had come forward an
adventurer without money, and whose very legitimacy was questioned. A
sovereign had resigned possessions over which he reigned in peace, to
hazard the uncertain fortune of war in behalf of a stranger. And now
another soldier of fortune, poor in territorial possessions, but rich in
illustrious ancestry, undertook the defence of a cause which the former
despaired of. Christian, Duke of Brunswick, administrator of
Halberstadt, seemed to have learnt from Count Mansfeld the secret of

"The man
maintained that the sea beat under the foundation of the island as far
as the spot where we now stood, and his story was rendered at least
probable by the number of pools of salt water which we met with in the
interior of the cave. After having visited the larger cavern, this certainly appeared to
disadvantage; though in truth it is in its dimensions only that the one
can be pronounced inferior to the other. The spar is equally clear and
proportionably as abundant in both: the pillars are quite as regularly
formed, and the lesser has an advantage over its rival in two or three
broken columns, which give to it the semblance of a temple in ruins. There is also in this cave a strange propinquity of salt and fresh
water pools, the situation of two of which struck me as peculiarly
curious. They were divided from each other by a piece of rock not much
thicker than a man’s hand; and yet the water from the one tasted as if
it had been taken from the German Ocean, whilst that from the other was
as fresh and pleasant as possible.",18479,1700s

do it if they were not trained carefully for it? If white people need
colleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black
people need nothing of the sort? If it is true that there are an appreciable number of Negro youth in
the land capable by character and talent to receive that higher
training, the end of which is culture, and if the two and a half
thousand who have had something of this training in the past have in
the main proved themselves useful to their race and generation, the
question then comes, What place in the future development of the South
ought the Negro college and college-bred man to occupy? That the
present social separation and acute race-sensitiveness must eventually
yield to the influences of culture, as the South grows civilized, is
clear. But such transformation calls for singular wisdom and patience.",408,1800s

personal life after death, and on the whole to have concluded that there
was no evidence for it. At the same time, it is essential to a just appreciation of him, either
as man or poet, to see how all his opinions and feelings were shaped

"Their family consisted of five sons and three

Esq. inserted in the Life of Goldsmith, which an anonymous writer, whom
I suppose to have been Cowper's friend, Mr. Rose, from a passage in Mr.
Nichol's Literary Anecdotes, prefixed to his Miscellaneous Works,
wonders are told of his early predilection for the poetical art; but
those who have observed the amplification with which the sprightly
sallies of childhood are related by domestic fondness, will listen to
such narrations with some abatement of confidence. It seems probable,
that a desire of literary distinction might have been infused into his
youthful mind by hearing of the reputation of his countryman, Parnell,
with whom, as we learn from his life of that poet, his father and uncle
were acquainted. He received the first rudiments of learning from a school-master who
taught in the village where his parents resided, and who had served as a
quarter-master during the war of the Succession in Spain; and from the
romantic accounts which this man delighted to give of his travels,
Goldsmith is supposed, by his sister, to have contracted his propensity
for a wandering life.",10660,1700s

Place of rest, where all righteous Souls go, which is to the sleep of
Death, for their was nothing did die but the Souls of them both; and the
Paradise Christ and the Thief went into that Day they suffered Death, I
declare it was this, that Christ was sure in himself that he should rise
from the Dead the third Day, and afterward should enter into eternal
Glory, and this Assurance in Christ that he should rise again the third
Day, it was Paradise and Peace to his Soul, that he should pass through
that Death, he was now to suffer that very Day into a new Life, that
should not be capable to die any more. So likewise when the Thief did truly believe that Jesus was the Christ,
the Saviour from eternal Death to those that did believe; as it is
certain he did when he said, _Lord, remember me, when thou comest into
thy Kingdom_; for he did really believe, that Christ would rise the
third Day, and that he would raise him to eternal Joy and Happiness at
the last Day; and the Thief dying in this Faith, he entred into Peace of
Mind, and had Rest and Freedom to die, in Hope and full Assurance that
Christ would raise him up Soul and Body to eternal Happiness at the last
Day. And this was that Paradise that Christ and the Thief were in, that very
Day they both suffered Death; for the Assurance of everlasting Life in a
Man's self here in Mortality, is the Paradise of Peace in this Life. This I know to be true, and this was the Paradise Christ did mean the
Thief should be in that very Day he believed; and not that either of
their Souls went out of their Bodies to any other Place or Paradise,
then what was in their own Bodies, as aforesaid. In like Manner People imagine, that the Soul of Man goeth out of the
Body at his Death, from that Saying _Acts_ 7.",68704,1600s

"And in regard of our earliest
Apprehensions concerning Vertue and Religion, it is certain that these
are form'd in Children much more from what they observe in the
Conversations or Actions of such Persons as they esteem, than by set
Discourses that they now and then hear from the Pulpit; which they can
neither understand nor attend to early enough to receive from those
Principles that shall influence them. But so soon (at the least) as
they are capable of minding and understanding Sermons, they (where the
thing is remarkable by others) do also take notice of it, if he who
frequently recommends a good Life to them, does not in his own
Conversation, and in the respect he expresses for Vertue in the
Persons of others, shew that he indeed prefers it answerably to the
Praises he gives it. And if such a Preacher, as this, shall openly
live in the practice of any known Immorality; or not doing so himself
shall yet manifestly prefer in his esteem those who do so, is it not
natural, for them who look upon this Man as a guide to Heaven, to
conclude from hence, that in reference to the obtaining of Eternal
Happiness, Vertue is not the thing, the most essentially requisite;
and much less certainly will they think it to be so with respect to
this present World, if they find their pious Instructor not only to
choose the Society of Persons Profligate and Debauch'd for his Friends
and Companions; but also (on all occasions) to labour the promotion of
the like Men to Employments of the highest Truth, in preference of
others of acknowledg'd Integrity and Sobriety of Life: The avow'd
Reason whereof being only that the first of these are by the Doctor
held the more Orthodox in Religion; is it not unavoidable, even to a
Child, to conclude, that Vertue is not the best recommendation in his
Opinion, whatever he sometimes seems to assert, when he is shewing his
Rhetorick in the Pulpit. And since he is an Authoriz'd Teacher of
Religion, will not (so far as his example influences) Vertue and
Religion be probably consider'd as distinct things, the latter of
which, as it always has had, always will have the preference. The same Consequence with this must needs, in like manner, follow,
where Parents (whose Practices have usually the greatest Authority
with their Children) do in this manner express their uncharitable
Zeal for their Opinions, by them call'd Orthodoxy: And such, no less
effectually, teach the separating of Religion from Vertue, than those
whom they, perhaps, greatly condemn for making this distinction in
Terms; tho' it is true, that That sort of Men who do use this
distinction in their Discourses, do seldom fail of practising
accordingly: None having usually a more fiery Zeal than such People
have for their Orthodox, or, what is call'd by them, sound Doctrine;
and the only difference is, that these Men are herein more consistent
with themselves than the former, since their Words and their Actions
correspond.",13285,1600s

He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it. SECOND GENTLEMAN. But that slander, sir,
Is found a truth now, for it grows again
Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain

Or some about him near, have, out of malice
To the good Queen, possessed him with a scruple

"And if he did
not admire the Arethusa, he was not alone in that. To the imprisoned one, shivering under the public covering, there came
suddenly a noise of bolts and chains. He sprang to his feet, ready to
welcome a companion in calamity; and instead of that, the door was flung
wide, the friendly gendarme appeared above in the strong daylight, and
with a magnificent gesture (being probably a student of the drama)—“_Vous
êtes libre_!” he said. None too soon for the Arethusa. I doubt if he
had been half-an-hour imprisoned; but by the watch in a man’s brain
(which was the only watch he carried) he should have been eight times
longer; and he passed forth with ecstasy up the cellar stairs into the
healing warmth of the afternoon sun; and the breath of the earth came as
sweet as a cow’s into his nostril; and he heard again (and could have
laughed for pleasure) the concord of delicate noises that we call the hum
of life.",614,1800s

"It is
said that when any title grew popular, it was stolen by the antagonist,
who by this stratagem conveyed his notions to those who would not have
received him had he not worn the appearance of a friend. The tumult of
those unhappy days left scarcely any man leisure to treasure up
occasional compositions; and so much were they neglected that a complete
collection is nowhere to be found. These Mercuries were succeeded by L’Estrange’s _Observator_; and that by
Lesley’s _Rehearsal_, and perhaps by others; but hitherto nothing had
been conveyed to the people, in this commodious manner, but controversy
relating to the Church or State; of which they taught many to talk, whom
they could not teach to judge. It has been suggested that the Royal Society was instituted soon after
the Restoration to divert the attention of the people from public
discontent. The _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ had the same tendency; they were
published at a time when two parties—loud, restless, and violent, each
with plausible declarations, and each perhaps without any distinct
termination of its views—were agitating the nation; to minds heated with
political contest they supplied cooler and more inoffensive reflections;
and it is said by Addison, in a subsequent work, that they had a
perceptible influence upon the conversation of that time, and taught the
frolic and the gay to unite merriment with decency—an effect which they
can never wholly lose while they continue to be among the first books by
which both sexes are initiated in the elegances of knowledge.",4679,1700s

"The degrees of slavery in America are as various in their intensity as
are the communities composing the Union. They may, however, be divided
with great propriety under two general heads--eastern and western
slavery. By eastern slavery, I refer to that in the slave states
bordering on the Atlantic, and those slave states on the other side of
the Alleghany mountains, which may be more directly considered as their
colonies, viz, in the first instance, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia,
North and South Carolina; and, secondly, Kentucky and Tennessee. We
have been accustomed lately to class the slaves as non-predial and
predial,--that is, those who are domestic, and those who work on the
plantations. This classification is not correct, if it is intended to
distinguish between those who are well, and those who are badly treated.",23137,1700s

manumission will entirely depend upon the manner in which you employ the

adversary held his ground unshaken. By this time the partisanship of the whites was unconcealed. Americans
supplied Mataafa with ammunition; English and Americans openly subscribed
together and sent boat-loads of provisions to his camp. One such boat
started from Apia on a day of rain; it was pulled by six oars, three

"Plato, following the doctrines of Timaeus and
Pythagoras, taught also a moral and intellectual system of doctrine,
comprehending at once the past, the present, and the future condition
of man. Jesus Christ divulged the sacred and eternal truths contained
in these views to mankind, and Christianity, in its abstract purity,
became the exoteric expression of the esoteric doctrines of the
poetry and wisdom of antiquity. The incorporation of the Celtic
nations with the exhausted population of the south, impressed
upon it the figure of the poetry existing in their mythology and
institutions. The result was a sum of the action and reaction of
all the causes included in it; for it may be assumed as a maxim that
no nation or religion can supersede any other without incorporating
into itself a portion of that which it supersedes. The abolition of
personal and domestic slavery, and the emancipation of women from
a great part of the degrading restraints of antiquity, were among
the consequences of these events.",5428,1700s

"But what is still more, my brain is more itself now
than it ever was; nor do any of these powers abate as I advance in
years; and this because, as I grow older, I lessen the quantity of
my solid food. This retrenchment is necessary, nor can it be avoided, since it is
impossible for a man to live for ever; and, as he draws near his
end, he is reduced so low as to be no longer able to take any
nourishment, unless it be to swallow, and that too with difficulty,
the yolk of an egg in the four and twenty hours, and thus end by
mere dissolution, without any pain or sickness, as I expect will
be my case. This is a blessing of great importance; yet may be
expected by all those, who shall lead a sober life, of whatever
degree or condition, whether high, or middling, or low; for we
are all of the same species, and composed of the same four elements. And, since a long and healthy life ought to be greatly coveted by
every man, as I shall presently shew, I conclude, that every man
is bound in duty to exert himself to obtain longevity, and that he
cannot promise himself such a blessing without temperance and
sobriety. Some allege, that many, without leading such a life, have lived
to an hundred, and that in constant health, though they eat a
great deal, and used indiscriminately every kinds of viands and
wine; and, therefore, flatter themselves, that they shall be
equally fortunate.",30660,1400s

going home. Collecting his brother Fred, who was fruitlessly panning the sands of
the Last Chance Gulch in the high border country of Montana, Moses
started east, passing of course through the Black Hills, to scout down
this one last ray of rumor—that a new strike was in the making. Setting
out their camp in Bobtail Gulch, a mere pistol shot from certain placer
claims in Deadwood Gulch, they went to work in midwinter, hoping to
find, the legend has it, just enough blossom rock to give them a stake
for their homeward journey. They seem to have hit it with a vengeance, not mere placer gold in the
stream bed but a genuine lode, for on April 9, 1876, they patented the
claim known as the Homestake. Discarding for the moment all idea of
going on home with whatever meager wealth this “last” try should bring

"Anatomically the cerebrum is a
complex elaboration of cells and fibers that have these main
purposes: First, to record in perfect and detailed fashion the
EXPERIENCES of the organism, so that here are memory centers for
visual and auditory experiences, for skin, joint and bone
experiences of all kinds, speech memories, action memories, and
undoubtedly for the recording in some way not understood of the
pleasure-pain feelings. Second, it has a hold, a grip on the
motor mechanism of the body, on the muscles that produce action,
so that the intelligence can nicely adapt movement to the
circumstances, to purpose, and can inhibit the movements that
arise reflexly. Thus in certain diseases, where the part of the
brain involved in movement is injured, voluntary movement
disappears but reflex action is increased. Third, the neopallium,
or cerebrum, is characterized by what are known as association
tracts, i.e., connections of intricate kinds which link together
areas of the brain having different functions and thus allow for
combinations of activity of all kinds. The brain thus acts to
increase the memories of the past, and, as we all know, man is
probably the only animal to whom the past is a controlling force,
sometimes even an overpowering force.",1575,1800s

The Prince understanding of this so sudden and unexpected Accident, only
accompanied with an hundred of his Gentry and Nobility, went into the
Camp to _Busca,_ to let him know how ignorant he was of his Lieutenants
error, that he had done it without his direction or knowledge, freely
offering to perform what was concluded by his Ambassadors with the
Emperor; {MN} and so causing all his Garrisons to come out of their strong
Holds, he delivered all to _Busca_ for the Emperor, and so went to
_Prague,_ where he was honourably received, and established in his
Possessions, as his Imperial Majesty had promised. _Busca_ assembling all
the Nobility, took their Oaths of Allegiance and Fidelity, and thus their
Prince being gone _Transilvania_ became again subject to the Emperor.",55199,1500s

"Should the wind shift, we always had the direct
route before us; and I had my doubts whether putting a bold face on the
matter, running close in with the English shore, and appearing to be bound
for London, were not the wisest course. There certainly was the danger of
the Speedy's telling our story, in which case there would be a sharp
look-out for us; while there was the equal chance that she might speak
nothing for a week. Eight-and-forty hours ahead of her, I should not have
feared much from her account of us. It is unnecessary to dwell minutely on the events of the next few days. The weather continued good, the wind fair and our progress was in

"We came to the channel of the main
river, after proceeding about three miles in the direction of a turn in
our route beyond next camp. The channel here was broad, and occasionally
filled with a good body of water. The bed was sandy, and in it grew a
tree with thin loose white bark, resembling that of the mimosa or tea-
tree of the colony; some of these trees were of large dimensions. There
also grew, in the sandy bed of this river, a new white-flowered
MELALEUCA, resembling M. ERICIFOLIA, but with long mucronate leaves[*];
and, in the scrubby bank the STENOCHILUS BIGNONIOEFLORUS formed a willow-
like shrub fifteen feet high. We again came came upon our track where I
intended to hit it, although we had been retarded by brigalow scrub.",9943,1700s

"he enters me might
and main, with... oh! my pen drops from here in the extasy now present
to my faithful memory! Description too deserts me, and delivers over a
task, above its strength of wing, to the imagination: but it must be an
imagination exalted by such a flame as mine that can do justice to that
sweetest, noblest of all sensations, that hailed and accompanied the
stiff insinuation all the way up, till it was at the end of its
penetration, sending up, through my eyes, the sparks of the love-fire
that ran all over me and blazed in every vein and every pore of me; a
system incarnate of joy all over. I had now totally taken in love’s true arrow from the point up to the
feather, in that part, where making no new wound, the lips or the
original one of nature, which had owed its first breathing to this dear
instrument, clung, as if sensible of gratitude, in eager suction round
it, whilst all its inwards embraced it tenderly, with a warmth of gust,
a compressive energy, that gave it, in its way, the heartiest welcome
in nature; every fibre there gathering tight round it, and straining
ambitiously to come in for its share of the blissful touch. As we were giving them a few moments pause to the the delectations of
the senses, in dwelling with the highest relish on this intimatest
point of re-union, and chewing the cud of enjoyment, the impatience
natural to the pleasure soon drove us into action.",25305,1700s

"And out over the
vast expanse swept the wave of frightful mirth, until the half-seen
things in the black waters sent out bellows that tore at my eardrums,
and the unseen roof far overhead sent back roaring echoes of the clamor. And I laughed with them, laughed insanely, until I dropped exhausted
into my seat and watched the scarred man at the other end of the table

"Madam, said I, they all have it!--Now indeed they have it--

And let them have it;--I should belie my love for the friend of my heart,
were I to pity them!--But how unhappy am I [looking upon her] that I saw
her not before these eyes were shut, before these lips were for ever
closed!--O Sir, you know not the wisdom that continually flowed from
these lips when she spoke!--Nor what a friend I have lost! Then surveying the lid, she seemed to take in at once the meaning of the
emblems; and this gave her so much fresh grief, that though she several
times wipes her eyes, she was unable to read the inscription and texts;
turning, therefore, to me, Favour me, Sir, I pray you, by a line, with
the description of these emblems, and with these texts; and if I might be
allowed a lock of the dear creature's hair----

I told her that her executor would order both; and would also send her a
copy of her last will; in which she would find the most grateful
remembrances of her love for her, whom she calls The sister of her heart. Justly, said she, does she call me so; for we had but one heart, but one
soul, between us; and now my better half is torn from me--What shall I
do? But looking round her, on a servant's stepping by the door, as if again
she had apprehended it was some of the family--Once more, said she, a
solemn, an everlasting adieu!--Alas for me! a solemn, an everlasting
adieu!",12398,1600s
"I now determined on a second assault. Johnston was in my rear, only
fifty miles away, with an army not much inferior in numbers to the one I
had with me, and I knew he was being reinforced. There was danger of his
coming to the assistance of Pemberton, and after all he might defeat my
anticipations of capturing the garrison if, indeed, he did not prevent
the capture of the city. The immediate capture of Vicksburg would save
sending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere, and
would set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State. But
the first consideration of all was--the troops believed they could carry
the works in their front, and would not have worked so patiently in the
trenches if they had not been allowed to try.",1067,1800s

Study the fabrics for the size, color, and placing of the design in the

"And others say, that, when but three hours old,
 The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,
 And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,
 And like a horticultural adept,                               _300
 Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,
 And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept
 Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,
 And with his wings fanning it as it grew. 33. The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305
 Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began
 To turn the light and dew by inward power
 To its own substance; woven tracery ran
 Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er
 The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310
 Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion
 Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean. 34. This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit
 A living spirit within all its frame,
 Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.",4696,1700s
"It had become usual, as the slow drift
northward was made toward the end of winter, for some of the people to
split away from the main body and range beyond the gray mountains that
marked the western limits of the old territories. Since these wanderers
were usually the most willful and headstrong, they were regarded as
quasi-outcasts by the more settled people of the old range. But--and here Riya felt the shame pierce more strongly than ever--they
had their uses, occasionally. Preoccupied in her shame, she
involuntarily turned her head downward, anxious that none of the people
be staring derisively upward at the shaggy brown hump of fur that was
she, toiling up the path. She was not the first--but that was meaningless.",34420,1900s
"I must farther add, though it may appear impossible to some, and may
be so in some measure, that at this age I enjoy, at once, two lives;
one terrestrial, which I possess in fact; the other celestial, which
I possess in thought; and this thought is equal to actual enjoyment,
when founded upon things we are sure to attain, as I ams sure to
attain that celestial life, through the infinite goodness and mercy
of God. Thus, I enjoy this terrestrial life, in consequence of my
sobriety and temperance, virtues so agreeable to the Deity; and I
enjoy, by the grace of the same Divine Majesty, the celestial, which
he makes me anticipate in thought; a thought so lovely, as to fix me
entirely on this object, the enjoyment of which I hold and affirm to
be of the utmost certainty. And I hold that dying, in the manner I
expect, is not really death, but a passage of the soul from this
earthly life to a celestial, immortal, and infinitely perfect
existence. Neither can it be otherwise: and this thought is so
superlatively sublime, that it can no longer stoop to low and worldly
objects, such as the death of this body, being intirely taken up with
the happiness of living a celestial and divine life; whence it is,
that I enjoy two lives. Nor can the terminating of so high a
gratification, which I enjoy in this life, give me any concern; it
rather affords me infinite pleasure, as it will be only to make room
for another, glorious and immortal life.",30660,1400s
"A full minute passed before Lawton could put a stop to that. Even while
careening he had been alive to Slashaway's peril, and had tried to leap
to his aid. But the ship's steadily increasing gyrations had hurled him
away from the skipper and against a massive vaulting horse, barking the
flesh from his shins and spilling him with violence onto the deck. He crawled now toward the prone gym slugger on his hands and knees, his
temples thudding. The gyrations ceased an instant before he reached
Slashaway's side.",24151,1900s

MAIN STREET AND OTHER POEMS




Main Street

(For S. M. L.)



 I like to look at the blossomy track of the moon upon the sea,
 But it isn't half so fine a sight as Main Street used to be
 When it all was covered over with a couple of feet of snow,
 And over the crisp and radiant road the ringing sleighs would go. Now, Main Street bordered with autumn leaves, it was a pleasant thing,
 And its gutters were gay with dandelions early in the Spring;
 I like to think of it white with frost or dusty in the heat,
 Because I think it is humaner than any other street.",264,1800s
"Far from it; they proceed from Sin to Sin,
  Till _Turks_ and Heathens have much more of Christ. O Sires, consider that your Hosts make War
  On Christ, and on His Brethren, and your own,
  On Virtue, Piety, and Plenty too. Peace to all these concede: Be truly great,
  Delight in Justice, Virtue, Goodness, Love:
  This is the only Way to be like GOD. _FINIS._

I greatly fear that at this day few or no colleges, monasteries, altars,

of fasts and special prayers to certain saints. I fear that in all these
nothing is being sought but what is already ours; while we fancy that
by these things our sins are purged away and salvation is attained, and
thus utterly do away with Christian liberty. This comes from ignorance
of Christian faith and liberty. This ignorance and this crushing of liberty are diligently promoted by
the teaching of very many blind pastors, who stir up and urge the people
to a zeal for these things, praising them and puffing them up with their
indulgences, but never teaching faith. Now I would advise you, if you
have any wish to pray, to fast, or to make foundations in churches, as
they call it, to take care not to do so with the object of gaining any

limited demands of the animals. After partaking of my evening meal of cheese-like food and vegetable

how we spent our life. Now our food was vegetables of all kinds, turnips, cabbage, beans,
pease, and the like: nor did we despise beech-nuts, wild apples, pears,
and cherries: yea, and our hunger often made even acorns savoury to us;
our bread or, to say more truly, our cakes, we baked on hot ashes, and
they were made of Italian rye beaten fine. In winter we would catch
birds with springes and snares; but in spring and summer God bestowed
upon us young fledglings from their nest. Often must we make out with
snails and frogs: and so was fishing, both with net and line,
convenient to us: for close to our dwelling there flowed a brook, full
of fish and crayfish, all which did help to make our rough vegetable
diet palatable. Once on a time did we catch a young wild pig, and this
we penned in a stall, and did feed him with acorns and beech-nuts, so

do not condemn you, because for Christ's sake we have a sure and firm
reconciliation, if you believe, even though sin inhere in your flesh. The promise ought always to be in sight that God, because of His
promise, wishes for Christ's sake, and not because of the Law or our
works, to be gracious and to justify. In this promise timid
consciences ought to seek reconciliation and justification, by this
promise they ought to sustain themselves, and be confident that for
Christ's sake, because of His promise, they have a gracious God. Thus works can never render a conscience pacified, but only the
promise can. If, therefore, justification and peace of conscience
must be sought elsewhere than in love and works, love and works do
not justify, although they are virtues and pertain to the
righteousness of the Law, in so far as they are a fulfilling of the
Law.",6744,1400s

Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could. “The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little. “’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”

“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding
their own business!”

rocks of Valencia, baked from above by the tropic sun and from below by
volcanic fires. As one of their engineers, one night in the Plaza, said
to me: “Those mines were conceived in hell, and stink to heaven, and
the reputation of every man of us that has touched them smells like the

At the time I was there the situation was “acute.” In Valencia the
situation always is acute, but this time it looked as though something

Mr. President:

It is now three years since the resolve was adopted by the Senate,
which it is my present motion to expunge from the journal. At the
moment that this resolve was adopted, I gave notice of my intention to
move to expunge it; and then expressed my confident belief that the
motion would eventually prevail. That expression of confidence was not
an ebullition of vanity, or a presumptuous calculation, intended to
accelerate the event it affected to foretell. It was not a vain boast,
or an idle assumption, but was the result of a deep conviction of the
injustice done President Jackson, and a thorough reliance upon the
justice of the American people.",741,1700s

his parrot describing some strange evolutions in an iron ring that swung
in the centre of his cage. He had been angling all day, and gave me a
history of his sport with as much minuteness as a general would talk
over a campaign, being particularly animated in relating the manner in
which he had taken a large trout, which had completely tasked all his
skill and wariness, and which he had sent as a trophy to mine hostess of

behold a poor fellow like this, after being tempest-tost through life,
safely moored in a snug and quiet harbor in the evening of his days! His
happiness, however, sprung from within himself and was independent of

the Court was not disturbed. The King had the Flanders regiment removed to Versailles; unfortunately
the idea of the officers of that regiment fraternising with the Body
Guards was conceived, and the latter invited the former to a dinner, which
was given in the great theatre of Versailles, and not in the Salon of
Hercules, as some chroniclers say. Boxes were appropriated to various
persons who wished to be present at this entertainment. The Queen told me
she had been advised to make her appearance on the occasion, but that
under existing circumstances she thought such a step might do more harm
than good; and that, moreover, neither she nor the King ought directly to
have anything to do with such a festival.",3888,1700s

is altogether beside the usual course of nature. This blessing is,
that I had already lived fifty years, in spite of a most powerful
and mortal enemy, which I can by no means conquer, because it is
natural, or an occult quality implanted in my body by nature; and
this is, that every year, from the beginning of July till the end
of August, I cannot drink any wine of whatever kind or country; for,
besides being during these two months quite disgustful to my palate,
it disagrees with my stomach. Thus losing my milk, for wine is,
indeed, the milk of old age; and having nothing to drink, for no
change or preparation of waters can have the virtue of wine, nor of
course do me any good; having nothing, I say, to drink, and my
stomach being therefore disordered, I can eat but very little; and

"But though cultivation cannot be extended, and the produce of the
country increased, but in such a state of things as would allow of a
rise of rents, yet it is of importance to remark, that this rise of
rents will be by no means in proportion to the extension of cultivation,
or the increase of produce. Every relative fall in the price of the
instruments of production, may allow of the employment of a considerable
quantity of additional capital; and when either new land is taken
into cultivation, or the old improved, the increase of produce may
be considerable, though the increase of rents be trifling. We see, in
consequence, that in the progress of a country towards a high state of
cultivation, the quantity of capital employed upon the land, and
the quantity of produce yielded by it, bears a constantly increasing
proportion to the amount of rents, unless counterbalanced by
extraordinary improvements in the modes of cultivation. [11]

According to the returns lately made to the Board of Agriculture, the
average proportion which rent bears to the value of the whole produce,
seems not to exceed one fifth; [12] whereas formerly, when there was
less capital employed, and less value produced, the proportion amounted
to one fourth, one third, or even two fifths. Still, however, the
numerical difference between the price of produce and the expenses of
cultivation, increases with the progress of improvement; and though the
landlord has a less share of the whole produce, yet this less share,
from the very great increase of the produce, yields a larger quantity,
and gives him a greater command of corn and labour.",4336,1700s

pricking them is to make the compleat number of changes by a method
differing from that of other Peals. For although five can be varied but

"The business of letters,
howsoever simple it may seem to those who think truth-telling a gift of
nature, is in reality two-fold, to find words for a meaning, and to find
a meaning for words. Now it is the words that refuse to yield, and now
the meaning, so that he who attempts to wed them is at the same time
altering his words to suit his meaning, and modifying and shaping his
meaning to satisfy the requirements of his words. The humblest processes
of thought have had their first education from language long before they
took shape in literature. So subtle is the connexion between the two
that it is equally possible to call language the form given to the matter
of thought, or, inverting the application of the figure, to speak of
thought as the formal principle that shapes the raw material of language. It is not until the two become one that they can be known for two.",1038,1800s

enter the upper side of the head of the Cask, and in order to give a

Vapour with it, it will be proper to fix at the Bung-hole a long

escaped; as appeared by the Dampness of a Piece of Paper, fixed at a
little Distance above the Mouth of the Gun barrel. This Vapour became
visible, and much increased, when the Water in the Worm-tub was very

"Her reign was one of the longest and most successful in that period
known in history as the Golden Age of China. Because of the relentless
native prejudice against a successful woman, in a country where girl
babies are ruthlessly drowned, as the quickest way of ridding the world
of useless incumbrances, Chinese historians have endeavored to blacken
her character and undervalue her services. But later scholars now see
that she was a powerful and successful queen, who did great good to her
native land, and strove to maintain its power and glory. She never forgot her good friend and protector, Thomas the Nestorian. During her long reign of almost fifty years, Christianity strengthened
in the kingdom, and obtained a footing that only the great Mahometan
conquests of five centuries later entirely destroyed; and the Empress
Woo, so the chronicles declare, herself “offered sacrifices to the great
God of all.” When, hundreds of years after, the Jesuit missionaries
penetrated into this most exclusive of all the nations of the earth,
they found near the palace at Chang-an the ruins of the Nestorian
mission church, with the cross still standing, and, preserved through
all the changes of dynasties, an abstract in Syriac characters of the
Christian law, and with it the names of seventy-two attendant priests

kinds of air, but not in _vacuo_, which is also the case with gunpowder;
and, as I have in effect observed before, all the kinds of air in which
this paper was burned received an addition to their bulk, which
consisted partly of nitrous air, from the nitrous precipitate, and
partly of inflammable air, from the paper. As some of the circumstances
attending the ignition of this paper in some of the kinds of air were a
little remarkable, I shall just recite them. Firing this paper in _inflammable_ air, which it did without any
ignition of the inflammable air itself, the quantity increased
regularly, till the phial in which the process was made was nearly full;
but then it began to decrease, till one third of the whole quantity
disappeared. A piece of this paper being put to three ounce measures of _acid_ air, a
great part of it presently turned yellow, and the air was reduced to one
third of the original quantity, at the same time becoming reddish,
exactly like common air in a phial containing smoking spirit of nitre. After this, by the approach of hot iron, I set fire to the paper;
immediately upon which there was a production of air which more than
filled the phial.",29734,1700s

"In the days of _Erechtheus_ King of _Athens_, and _Celeus_ King of
_Eleusis_, _Ceres_ came into _Attica_; and educated _Triptolemus_ the son
of _Celeus_, and taught him to sow corn. She [136] lay with _Jasion_, or
_Jasius_, the brother of _Harmonia_ the wife of _Cadmus_; and presently
after her death _Erechtheus_ was slain, in a war between the _Athenians_
and _Eleusinians_; and, for the benefaction of bringing tillage into
_Greece_, the _Eleusinia Sacra_ were instituted to her [137] with
_Egyptian_ ceremonies, by _Celeus_ and _Eumolpus_; and a Sepulchre or
Temple was erected to her in _Eleusine_, and in this Temple the families of
_Celeus_ and _Eumolpus_ became her Priests: and this Temple, and that which
_Eurydice_ erected to her daughter _Danae_, by the name of _Juno Argiva_,
are the first instances that I meet with in _Greece_ of Deifying the dead,
with Temples, and Sacred Rites, and Sacrifices, and Initiations, and a
succession of Priests to perform them. Now by this history it is manifest
that _Erechtheus_, _Celeus_, _Eumolpus_, _Ceres_, _Jasius_, _Cadmus_,
_Harmonia_, _Asterius_, and _Dardanus_ the brother of _Jasius_, and one of
the founders of the Kingdom of _Troy_, were all contemporary to one
another, and flourished in their youth, when _Cadmus_ came first into
_Europe_. _Erechtheus_ could not be much older, because his daughter
_Procris_ convers'd with _Minos_ King of _Crete_; and his grandson
_Thespis_ had fifty daughters, who lay with _Hercules_; and his daughter
_Orithyia_ was the mother of _Calais_ and _Zetes_, two of the _Argonauts_

father of _Menestheus_, who warred at _Troy_: nor much younger, because his
second son _Pandion_, who with the _Metionides_ deposed his elder brother
_Cecrops_, was the father of _Ægeus_, the father of _Theseus_; and
_Metion_, another of his sons, was the father of _Eupalamus_, the father of
_Dædalus_, who was older than _Theseus_; and his daughter _Creusa_ married
_Xuthus_, the son of _Hellen_, and by him had two sons, _Achæus_ and _Ion_;
and _Ion_ commanded the army of the _Athenians_ against the _Eleusinians_,
in the battle in which his grandfather _Erechtheus_ was slain: and this was
just before the institution of the _Eleusinia Sacra_, and before the Reign
of _Pandion_ the father of _Ægeus_. _Erechtheus_ being an _Egyptian_
procured corn from _Egypt_, and for that benefaction was made King of
_Athens_; and near the beginning of his Reign _Ceres_ came into _Attica_

"But about tricks
on mortal babies. I said to Sir Huon in the fern here, on just such a
morning as this: “If you crave to act and influence on folk in housen,
which I know is your desire, why don’t you take some human cradle-babe
by fair dealing, and bring him up among yourselves on the far side
of Cold Iron--as Oberon did in time past? Then you could make him a
splendid fortune, and send him out into the world.”

"Coligny, who had strongly opposed the candidature of Anjou for the throne
of Poland, was set on by an assassin, employed by the Queen-mother and
her favourite son, and badly wounded; the Huguenots were in utmost alarm,
filling the air with cries and menaces. Charles showed great concern for
his friend's recovery, and threatened vengeance on the assassins. What
was his astonishment to learn that those assassins were his mother and
brother! Catherine worked on his fears, and the plot for the great
massacre was combined in an instant. The very next day after the King's
consent was wrung from him, 24th August, 1572, the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's day took place.",3840,1500s
"But the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain’s
forefinger, jealousy. Now, at least, he felt that keenest sting—a
mounting love unworthily bestowed. Whatever she might be, he loved her;
he bore in his own breast his doom. A grating, comic flavour to his
predicament struck him suddenly, and he laughed creakingly as he swung
down the echoing pavement. An impetuous desire to act, to battle with
his fate, seized him.",1595,1800s

science. Francolins and Guinea-fowl abound along the banks; and on every dead
tree and piece of rock may be seen one or two species of the web-footed
'Plotus', darter, or snake-bird. They sit most of the day sunning
themselves over the stream, sometimes standing erect with their wings
outstretched; occasionally they may be seen engaged in fishing by
diving, and, as they swim about, their bodies are so much submerged that
hardly any thing appears above the water but their necks. The chief time

emotion betrayed itself in tears which, in a man of my age, might be

the sacristy the address of the bishop, and next morning found myself
walking in Hyde Park, alarmed at the step I was about to take, and
almost undecided. A friend, who was in my confidence, met me by chance,

the title of _Sure and certain methods of attaining a long and
healthy life_. The translator seems rather to have made use of a
French version than of the Italian original; he has likewise
omitted several passages of the Italian, and the whole is rather a
paraphrase than a translation. This has induced us to give the
public an exact and faithful version of that excellent performance,

"And the term ""person"" they use as the Fathers have used it,
to signify, not a part or quality in another, but that which subsists of
itself. They condemn all heresies which have sprung up against this article,
as the Manichaeans, who assumed two principles, one Good and the other
Evil--also the Valentinians, Arians, Eunomians, Mohammedans, and all
such. They condemn also the Samosatenes, old and new, who, contending
that there is but one Person, sophistically and impiously argue that
the Word and the Holy Ghost are not distinct Persons, but that ""Word""
signifies a spoken word, and ""Spirit"" signifies motion created in
things. Article II: Of Original Sin. Also they teach that since the fall of Adam all men begotten in the
natural way are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without
trust in God, and with concupiscence; and that this disease, or vice
of origin, is truly sin, even now condemning and bringing eternal death

"My father, young and gallant,
could not comprehend why he did not gratify his love. He believed his
reserve to arise from timidity, and under this impression proposed one
day to the King to be his ambassador and to bring the affair to a
satisfactory conclusion. The King allowed him to speak to the end, and
then assumed a severe air. ""It is true,"" said he, ""that I am enamoured
of her, that I feel it, that I seek her, that I speak of her willingly,
and think of her still more willingly; it is true also that I act thus in
spite of myself, because I am mortal and have this weakness; but the more
facility I have as King to gratify myself, the more I ought to be on my
guard against sin and scandal. I pardon you this time, but never address
to me a similar discourse again if you wish that I should continue to
love you.""",3860,1600s
"By which means it falls out,
that all the Riches of the _Black Sea_, whether exported or imported,
are at her Command. And indeed such considerable Exportations are
made from hence of Hydes of all Kinds, of Honey, of Wax, of Slaves,
and other Commodities, as supply a great Part of _Europe_, _Asia_
and _Africa_; and on the other hand, there are imported from those
Places such extraordinary Quantities of Wine, Oil, Corn, and other
Goods without Number, that _Mysia_, _Dacia_, _Pannonia_, _Sarmatia_,
_Mæotis_, _Colchis_, _Spain_, _Albania_, _Cappadocia_, _Armenia_,
_Media_, _Parthia_, and both Parts of _Scythia_, share in the great
Abundance. ’Tis for this Reason, that not only all foreign Nations, if
they would entitle themselves to any Property in the immense Wealth of
the _Black Sea_, but also all Sea Port and Island Towns are obliged
to court the Friendship of this City. Besides, ’tis impossible for
any Ships to pass or repass, either from _Asia_ or _Europe_, but at
her Pleasure, she being as it were the Bridge and Port of both those
Worlds; nay, I might call her the Continent that joins them, did
not the _Hellespont_ divide them. But this Sea is thought, in many
Respects, to be inferior to that of _Constantinople_; first, as it is
much larger, and then, as not having a Bay as that has, by which its
City might be made a _Peninsula_, and a commodious Port for Ships:
And indeed if it had such a Bay, yet could it reap no Advantage of
Commerce from the _Black Sea_, but by the Permission of the People of
_Constantinople_.",53083,1400s
"The octagon tower casts a shade

          And bubbles rise to the fountain's brim. The minstrel touches his silver strings,

"It is ordinarily but a
hedge bush, although being pruned and dressed, it grows to a tree of a
reasonable height. As for the Hawthorn Tree at Glastonbury, which is said to flower
yearly on Christmas-day, it rather shews the superstition of those
that observe it for the time of its flowering, than any great wonder,
since the like may be found in divers other places of this land; as in
Whey-street in Romney Marsh, and near unto Nantwich in Cheshire, by a
place called White Green, where it flowers about Christmas and May. If
the weather be frosty, it flowers not until January, or that the hard
weather be over. _Government and virtues._] It is a tree of Mars. The seeds in the
berries beaten to powder being drank in wine, are held singularly good
against the stone, and are good for the dropsy.",49513,1600s
"Yet in a matter as simple as staying alive or not
staying alive--in which it might be supposed that all human beings would
have the same basic response--the difference between Japanese and
Americans was found to be basic when it came to surrender. To Japanese
soldiers, the verbal distinction between _surrender_ and _cease
honorable resistance_ was as important as the difference between life
and death. The Japanese would not survive at the cost of their honor,
but if their honor were satisfied, they willingly gave up. Propaganda is directed to the subtle niceties of thought by which people

diet, he recovered his health and vigour, which he preserved to an
extreme old age. At a very advanced stage of life he wrote the
following discourses, wherein he acquaints us with the irregularity
of his youth, his reformation of manners, and the hopes he
entertained of living a long time. Nor was he mistaken in his
expectation, for he resigned his last breath without any agony,
sitting in an elbow chair, being above an hundred years old. This
happened at Padua, the 26th of April, 1566. His lady, almost as

"IX). Now, it is against
Scripture to establish or require the observance of any traditions, to
the end that by such observance we may make satisfaction for sins, or
merit grace and righteousness. For the glory of Christ's merit suffers
injury when, by such observances, we undertake to merit justification. But it is manifest that, by such belief, traditions have almost
infinitely multiplied in the Church, the doctrine concerning faith and
the righteousness of faith being meanwhile suppressed. For gradually
more holy-days were made, fasts appointed, new ceremonies and services
in honor of saints instituted, because the authors of such things
thought that by these works they were meriting grace.",275,1400s

Killbally forces us to take three cups of tea and a half-dozen marmalade
sandwiches whenever we go to the Castle; for I apologised for our
appetites, one day, by confessing that we had lunched somewhat frugally,
the meal being sweetened, however, by Molly's explanation that there was
a fresh sole in the house, but she thought she would not inthrude on it
before dinner! We asked, on our arrival at Knockarney House, if we might breakfast at
a regular hour,--say eight thirty. Mrs. Mullarkey agreed, with
that suavity which is, after her untidiness, her distinguishing
characteristic; but notwithstanding this arrangement we break our fast
sometimes at nine forty, sometimes at nine twenty, sometimes at nine,
but never earlier. In order to achieve this much, we are obliged to
rise early and make a combined attack on the executive and culinary
departments.",1391,1800s

had the software could query the central registry to find a
file's location and then establish a direct computer-to-computer
connection--anywhere in the world--with the person who had the
file they desired. This decentralized design meant the system
was extremely ""robust,"" very fast, and of nearly infinite
capacity. Using this technology, tens of millions of people

"Even now an auctioneer could say something
for it: it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it; it had a
firm mahogany base, well supplied with drawers, which opened with a
decided jerk and sent the contents leaping out from the farthest
corners, without giving you the trouble of reaching them; above all, it
had a brass candle-socket on each side, which would give it an
aristocratic air to the very last. But Hetty objected to it because it
had numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror, which no rubbing
would remove, and because, instead of swinging backwards and forwards,
it was fixed in an upright position, so that she could only get one
good view of her head and neck, and that was to be had only by sitting
down on a low chair before her dressing-table. And the dressing-table
was no dressing-table at all, but a small old chest of drawers, the
most awkward thing in the world to sit down before, for the big brass
handles quite hurt her knees, and she couldn’t get near the glass at
all comfortably. But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences to
prevent them from performing their religious rites, and Hetty this
evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual. Having taken off her gown and white kerchief, she drew a key from the
large pocket that hung outside her petticoat, and, unlocking one of the
lower drawers in the chest, reached from it two short bits of wax
candle—secretly bought at Treddleston—and stuck them in the two brass
sockets.",507,1800s

they fled to the Mountains, (their usual Refuge) for shelter,
commanding their Subjects to obey the _Spaniards_, as Lords, but withal
strictly and expressly prohibiting and forbidding them, to inform the
_Spaniards_ of their Flight, or the Places of their Concealment. And
behold a great many of the _Indians_ addrest themselves to them,
earnestly requesting, they would admit them as Subjects, being very
willing and ready to serve them: The Captain replyed that he would not
entertain them in such a Capacity, but instead of so doing would put
every individual Person to Death, if they would not discover the
Receptacles of the Fugitive Governours. The _Indians_ made answer that
they were wholly ignorant of the matter, yet that they themselves,
their Wives and Children should serve them; that they were at home,
they might come to them and put them to Death, or deal with them as
they pleas'd.",20321,1400s

"Intrusted with the duty of taking
""care that the laws be faithfully executed,"" my only desire was that the
people of Kansas should furnish to Congress the evidence required by the
organic act, whether for or against slavery, and in this manner smooth
their passage into the Union. In emerging from the condition of Territorial
dependence into that of a sovereign State it was their duty, in my opinion,
to make known their will by the votes of the majority on the direct
question whether this important domestic institution should or should not
continue to exist. Indeed, this was the only possible mode in which their
will could be authentically ascertained. The election of delegates to a convention must necessarily take place in
separate districts. From this cause it may readily happen, as has often
been the case, that a majority of the people of a State or Territory are on

"He used to
tell him, if they wanted to fish to eat or sell, to catch them with a
net, and to kill them at once; and I believe that the sight of the deaf
and dumb boy, taking such pains to plead for the creatures which are not
only dumb, but have no way of pleading for themselves, was the means of
checking many persons in cruel practices. He knew very little compared
with what you, perhaps, know; but he knew one blessed truth--he knew
that ""God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life;"" and by always thinking on this great mercy of God to man, and the
exceeding love of our Lord Jesus Christ, in dying for poor sinners like
us, Jack came to hate whatever he knew to be displeasing to that
gracious Lord and heavenly Father; and the happiness that he felt in his
own soul made him delight in seeking the happiness of every creature
around him. Jack died of a slow decline. He had much pain, but I never saw him look
impatient or unhappy. He felt what David so beautifully describes in the
twenty-third Psalm: ""Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me.""",17961,1700s

"Those who do harm to her are doing your office; those who in every
way abhor her are glorifying Christ; in short, those are Christians who
are not Romans. But, to say yet more, even this never entered my heart: to inveigh
against the Court of Rome or to dispute at all about her. For, seeing
all remedies for her health to be desperate, I looked on her with
contempt, and, giving her a bill of divorcement, said to her, ""He that
is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is filthy, let him
be filthy still,"" giving myself up to the peaceful and quiet study of
sacred literature, that by this I might be of use to the brethren living
about me. While I was making some advance in these studies, Satan opened his
eyes and goaded on his servant John Eccius, that notorious adversary of
Christ, by the unchecked lust for fame, to drag me unexpectedly into the
arena, trying to catch me in one little word concerning the primacy of
the Church of Rome, which had fallen from me in passing. That boastful
Thraso, foaming and gnashing his teeth, proclaimed that he would dare
all things for the glory of God and for the honour of the holy apostolic
seat; and, being puffed up respecting your power, which he was about
to misuse, he looked forward with all certainty to victory; seeking to

to it and burnt them all alive, leaving the Region desert and desolate. They also came to another stately Province, bordering on St. _Martha_;

bestowing on them innumerable quantities of Gold besides many other
gifts, but when they were upon departure, in retribution of their Civil
Treating and Deportment the German Tyrant, commanded that all the

should be signified unto them, whosoever desired to be set at Liberty

administration or allowance of any food to them, till the Gold required
for Redemption was paid down to the utmost grain. Several of them sent
home to discharge the demanded price of their Redemption, and procur'd

Halbert's acquaintance with religious matters was no deeper than could
be derived from the Archbishop of Saint Andrew's Catechism, and the
pamphlet called the Twapennie Faith, both which were industriously
circulated and recommended by the monks of Saint Mary's. Yet, however
indifferent and superficial a theologian, he began to suspect that he
was now in company with one of the gospellers, or heretics, before
whose influence the ancient system of religion now tottered to the very
foundation. Bred up, as may well be presumed, in a holy horror against
these formidable sectaries, the youth's first feelings were those of a
loyal and devoted church vassal. “Old man,” he said, “wert thou able to
make good with thy hand the words that thy tongue hath spoken against
our Holy Mother Church, we should have tried upon this moor which of our
creeds hath the better champion.”

even better than in the old dingo days, but--well, they do say so. All
we can say is that when a shearer arrived with a cheque, and had a drink
or two, he was almost invariably seized with a desire to camp on the
premises for good, spend his cheque in the shortest possible time, and
forcibly shout for everything within hail--including the Chinaman cook
and Stiffner's disreputable old ram. The shanty was of the usual kind, and the scenery is as easily disposed

"Merceda is in a still more dangerous way. Besides his bruises, and a
fractured skull, he has, it seems, a wound in his thigh, which, in the
delirium he was thrown into by the fracture, was not duly attended to;
and which, but for his valiant struggles against the knife which gave the
wound, was designed for a still greater mischief. His recovery is
despaired of; and the poor wretch is continually offering up vows of
penitence and reformation, if his life may be spared. Bagenhall was the person who had seduced, by promises of marriage, and
fled for it, the manufacturer's daughter of Abbeville. He was overtaken
by his pursuers at Douay.",13884,1600s

continued until April 1796, when he was attacked with a paralytic
affection, which deprived him of the use of the left side. His
articulation was now hardly intelligible; he became childish, got
gradually weaker, and died December 28, 1796. He was opened twenty-four
hours after death. There was a general opacity of the tunica arachnoidea,

the ventricles were much enlarged and contained a considerable quantity of

"No flint tools have yet been observed
there, but had the old alluvium of Amiens or Abbeville occurred in the
Norfolk cliffs instead of the valley of the Somme, and had we depended
on the waves of the sea instead of the labour of many hundred workmen
continued for twenty years, for exposing the flint implements to view,
we might have remained ignorant to this day of the fossil relics brought
to light by M. Boucher de Perthes and those who have followed up his
researches. Neither need we despair of one day meeting with the signs of Man's
existence in the forest bed Number 3, or in the overlying strata 3
prime, on the ground of any uncongeniality in the climate or incongruity
in the state of the animate creation with the well-being of our species. For the present we must be content to wait and consider that we have
made no investigations which entitle us to wonder that the bones or
stone weapons of the era of the Elephas meridionalis have failed to come
to light. If any such lie hid in those strata, and should hereafter be
revealed to us, they would carry back the antiquity of Man to a distance
of time probably more than twice as great as that which separates
our era from that of the most ancient of the tool-bearing gravels yet
discovered in Picardy, or elsewhere. But even then the reader will
perceive that the age of Man, though pre-glacial, would be so modern
in the great geological calendar, as given in Chapter 1, that he would
scarcely date so far back as the commencement of the Pleistocene period.",6335,1700s

"But to make all yet more certain, I principally form my
examinations from the very history of the Languages, which is the most
æquall rule we can take our measures from, in relation to the present
designe. In order to this, 'tis necessary that we make reflexions upon the first
beginnings of each Nation, and that from other memoires then such with
which we are for the most part furnish't by the Criticks, and seriously to
examine the continuall comerce it hath had with the most considerable of
its neighbours, the wars, feuds and Leagues of its Governours with other
Princes, the irruptions and invasions of Conquering Nations, that have
corrupted its Language as they ingrost its spoils, the frequent Colonies
that Conquerors have sent thither besides its voyages at Sea, and its
traffick, with the most remote plantations, These are the more immediate
causes of this confusion and mixture. It may perhaps withall be no mean pleasure to see the basis of each
Language distinguisht from the changes and accessions of time or
revolutions of State, what every Nation hath contributed of its owne to
inrich it, what Religion, the Government and what Sciences have
communicated to it, what it retains of Antiquity and what new acquests it
hath made to retrieve its losses with advantage. Afterall, this is yet but the sceleton, or at most but the body of a
Language, Its necessary that this rude, and indigested masse made up of so
many different dialects should be animated by some secret spirit that
should expand it selfe through all its parts and severall members, and
reduce them to unity by communicating the same air to them, and that this
Spirit or Soul should be the individuall principle of all the effects, and
sensible changes, which make us easily distinguish one Language from
another: The Temper, Humour, and Nature of a people, the dispositions of
their minds, their genius and particular gusts, their more generall and
forcible inclinations, their ordinary passions, and such singular
qualities, by which one Nation is remarq'd and distinguisht from another,
are the most evident signs to discover the true genius of a Language,
because they are in reality the immediate causes and the very originalls
after which I have copied all my draughts to compleat the present piece,
which in my opinion is not wanting in something that is very Naturall,
Besides this, the very manners and customes of Nations, their Laws and
policy, and their publick transactions, both of peace and War, are things
so universally known, that there is no need of any farther search, how to
be able to judge by proportion of the genius, and characters of the
Languages so securely, as by that of the people that speak them. But as the care of a Nation to improve and advance the Arts and Sciences
and other kinds of good Learning, is that which contributes most to the
perfection of its Language, So tis upon the manner in which its receiv'd,
and the characters of its Authors, that I cheifly depend to determine,
whether it be modest or imperious, whether it rellish more of a softnesse,
sweetnesse, and delicacy, than of a certain Noble brisque and generous air,
whether it incline more to the simplicity of Nature, or the subtile
refinements of Art, whether it be polite to affectation, or betray a
certain negligence which hath its graces too, as well as its measures of
Art, and last of all whether it be not a little crampt in attempting to be
too exact, or else better accomodate it selfe by its freedome from all
restraint.",15649,1600s

  But you who seek to give and merit fame,
  And justly bear a Critic's noble name,
  Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,
  How far your genius, taste, and learning go;
  Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,                    50
  And mark that point where sense and dulness meet. Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,
  And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit. As on the land while here the ocean gains,
  In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;                       55
  Thus in the soul while memory prevails,
  The solid pow'r of understanding fails;
  Where beams of warm imagination play,
  The memory's soft figures melt away. One science only will one genius fit;                             60
  So vast is art, so narrow human wit:
  Not only bounded to peculiar arts,
  But oft in those confin'd to single parts. Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before,
  By vain ambition still to make them more;                         65

"And of the mortification of the flesh and discipline of the body we
thus teach, just as the Confession states, that a true and not a

which God exercises us [when God breaks our will, inflicts the cross
and trouble]. In these we must obey God's will, as Paul says, Rom. 12, 1: Present your bodies a living sacrifice. And these are the
spiritual exercises of fear and faith. But in addition to this
mortification which occurs through the cross [which does not depend
upon our will] there is also a voluntary kind of exercise necessary,
of which Christ says Luke 21, 34: Take heed to yourselves lest at any
time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting.",6744,1400s
"The Roman colony of Orange, to judge from the relative positions of the
arch and circus, must have been very considerable, and have occupied a
far larger space than the present town. The arch stands detached from
its entrance, as I mentioned, on the Lyons' side, and the circus at the
extreme end, in the direction of Avignon; yet the former we may suppose
to have joined on to the ancient town, and the latter to have stood in
the same central position which the Colosseum occupied in Rome. Of the
circus nothing now remains but the chord of the semicircle, or, to
express it more familiarly, the straight line of the D figure, in which
it was built. As far as I could guess, from pacing the length of this
enormous wall, encumbered and buttressed as it was by dirty shops, it is
in length nearly or quite a hundred yards, and of a height
proportionate. The point of view from which it appears to the most
advantage, is on the road to Avignon, about two or three furlongs out of
the town.",20891,1700s

His Majesty’s Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce several severe
bills against popery, if that is the case; and though he will have the
decency to appoint a previous committee of inquiry as to the fact, the
committee will be garbled, and the report inflammatory. Leaving this to
be settled as he pleases to settle it, I wish to inform you, that,
previously to the bill last passed in favour of the Catholics, at the
suggestion of Mr. Pitt, and for his satisfaction, the opinions of six of
the most celebrated of the foreign Catholic universities were taken as to
the right of the Pope to interfere in the temporal concerns of any
country. The answer cannot possibly leave the shadow of a doubt, even in
the mind of Baron Maseres; and Dr. Rennel would be compelled to admit it,
if three Bishops lay dead at the very moment the question were put to
him. To this answer might be added also the solemn declaration and
signature of all the Catholics in Great Britain. I should perfectly agree with you, if the Catholics admitted such a
dangerous dispensing power in the hands of the Pope; but they all deny
it, and laugh at it, and are ready to abjure it in the most decided
manner you can devise.",4063,1700s

"It is said to be the task of the American “to work the virgin soil,” and
that “agriculture here already assumes proportions unknown everywhere
else.” I think that the farmer displaces the Indian even because he
redeems the meadow, and so makes himself stronger and in some respects
more natural. I was surveying for a man the other day a single straight
line one hundred and thirty-two rods long, through a swamp at whose
entrance might have been written the words which Dante read over the
entrance to the infernal regions,—“Leave all hope, ye that enter”—that
is, of ever getting out again; where at one time I saw my employer
actually up to his neck and swimming for his life in his property,
though it was still winter. He had another similar swamp which I
could not survey at all, because it was completely under water, and
nevertheless, with regard to a third swamp, which I did survey from a
distance, he remarked to me, true to his instincts, that he would not
part with it for any consideration, on account of the mud which it
contained. And that man intends to put a girdling ditch round the whole

humours, with feverish sensations, and sharp pains, but steals
upon them insensibly and with the greatest ease and gentleness;

moisture, which decays by degrees like the oil of a lamp; so that
they pass gently, without any sickness, from this terrestrial and
mortal to a celestial and eternal life. O holy and truly happy regularity! How holy and happy should men,

guilt and misery, as evidently appears to those who consider the
opposite effects of both! so that men should know thee by thy voice

in the agonies of his death. It was in the morning of July 21, 1676,

means of preventing the Duke from marrying one of my granddaughters. Being the intimate friend of Madame de Berri, who was very desirous that
one of her sisters should marry the Duke and the other the Prince de
Conti, she promised to bring about the marriage, provided Madame de Berri
would say nothing of it to the King or to me. After having imposed this
condition, she told the King that Madame de Berri and my son were
planning a marriage without his sanction; in order to punish them she
begged the King to marry the Duke to herself, which was actually done. Thanks to her good sense, she lives upon tolerable terms with her
husband, although he has not much affection for her.",3857,1600s

"POSTSCRIPT TO THE NINTH EDITION. The Public has been of late much interested and not a little
bewildered, by the accounts of many strange events, said to have
recently taken place in France and other parts of the Continent. Are
these accounts of such a character as to allay, or to strengthen and
increase, such doubts as have been suggested in the foregoing pages? We are told that there is now a Napoleon Buonaparte at the head of the

"Let
it be ""burnt in on the memory"" of every generation, that such is the
legitimate tendency of infidel opinions. They first destroy the
conscience--blunt the moral sense--harden the heart, and wither up all
the social and kindly affections, and then their votaries are ripe for
any deed of wickedness within the possibility of accomplishment by human
agency. Says an eloquent writer--""When the Sabbath was abolished in France, the
Mighty God whose being they had denied, and whose worship they
abolished, stood aloof and gave them up,--and a scene of proscription,
and assassination, and desolation, ensued, unparalleled in the annals of
the civilized world. In the city of Paris, there were in 1803, eight
hundred and seven suicides and murders. Among the criminals executed,
there were seven fathers who had poisoned their children, ten husbands
who had murdered their wives, six wives who had poisoned their husbands,
and fifteen children who had destroyed their parents.""",22400,1500s

"Notwithstanding all the reinforcement which Oglethorpe had received,
it was judged impracticable to take the place by assault from the land
side, unless an attack could be made at the same time by the boats of
the men of war, and other small craft, on the sea side, on which the
town had no intrenchments; and to begin a regular siege on the land
side was impossible, as he had neither force enough for investing the
place, nor any pioneers for breaking the ground, and carrying on the
approaches. For this reason it was concerted between him and the sea
commanders, that as soon as they arrived off the bar of the north
channel, he should march up with his whole force, consisting of about
two thousand men, to St. Augustine, and give notice by a signal agreed
on, that he was ready to begin the attack by land; which should be
answered by a counter signal from the fleet of their readiness to
attack it by sea. Accordingly the General marched, and arrived near
the intrenchments of St. Augustine, June 4th, at night, having in his
way taken Fort Moosa, about three miles from St. Augustine, which the
garrison had abandoned upon his approach. He ordered the gates of the
fort to be burnt, and three breaches to be made in the walls. As soon as it was proper to begin the attack, he made the signal
agreed on, but had no countersign from the men of war.",10677,1700s

You will then become the guide and assistant of the leader of that
force, which is to move on to some secret and safe place, to be selected
by you (as you know the localities, and the leader don't) in the woods
near the Twenty Mile Encampment, where, acting is the advanced corps
of our planned expedition to the Connecticut by that route, they will
remain concealed as much as possible, till further orders, watching all
movements of the rebels, and drawing in every trusty loyalist that
can be approached. And mark me, Redding, while there, or elsewhere,
remember, that accursed Woodburn is a doomed man, and is to be taken, if
found, and kept for my disposal. And I have another order, which must be
left still more to your especial management. Haviland's daughter, with
whom you know, I suppose, how I am situated, has got some dangerous
notions into her head, and, refusing to hear to her father, who wishes
her to go with him to the army, has determined to go to her relatives,
over the mountain, in a carriage the rebels have promised to provide
her. She will be along that road, probably, soon after you get to your
rendezvous.",6947,1700s
"Christ also, when His disciples were asked for the tribute money, asked
of Peter whether the children of a king were not free from taxes. Peter
agreed to this; yet Jesus commanded him to go to the sea, saying, ""Lest
we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up
the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth thou
shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for Me and
thee"" (Matt. xvii. 27). This example is very much to our purpose; for here Christ calls Himself
and His disciples free men and children of a King, in want of nothing;
and yet He voluntarily submits and pays the tax.",1911,1400s
"From this Plantation they have
lately brought two Trees to _Amsterdam_, which, by the Skill of their
ingenious Gardiner, flourish and bear Fruit in such Perfection, that
several hundred Plants have been raised there from Seeds, ripened at
that Place; and which, from time to time, they transmit to _Surinam_,
and such Places in the _West-Indies_ as are in their possession. THE Heer _Gerbrand Pancrass_, Commissary of the Garden, and _President_
of the City of _Amsterdam_, did me the Honour to accommodate me with
this great Curiosity, which I sent into _England_, and intrusted to the
care of Mr. _Thomas Fairchild_, a most accurate Gardiner at _Hoxton_. AND since it has now found its way to _England_, it may be necessary to
offer some proper Directions for its Culture, agreeable with the Method
observed in the _Amsterdam_ Garden. WHEN we have an Opportunity to propagate these Trees from the Berries,
we must, immediately after they are gathered, carefully take off the
outside Husk, and separate the two Seeds which are found in each; and
set them an Inch deep in Pots of fine Earth, which are already warm in a
Bed prepared with Horse-litter; keeping the Glasses close covered for
six Weeks, and often sprinkling them with Water. From this way of
Management we may expect them to come up in less than two Months time

"And then 'tis Odds, but the Order of the
Little Extancies, and consequently that of the Little Depressions in point
of Situation will be alter'd likewise: as if you dissolve _Quick-silver_ in
some kind of _Aqua-fortis_, the Saline Particles of the _Menstruum_
Associating themselves with the Mercurial Corpuscles, will make a Green
Solution, which afterwards easily enough Degenerates. And Red Lead or
_Minium_ being Dissolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar, yields not a Red, but a
Clear Solution, the Redness of the Lead being by the Liquor Destroy'd. But
a better Instance may be taken from Copper, for I have try'd, that if upon
a Copper-plate you let some Drops of weak _Aqua-fortis_ rest for a while,
the Corpuscles of the _Menstruum_, joyning with those of the Metall, will
produce a very sensible Asperity upon the Surface of the Plate, and will
Concoagulate that way into very minute Grains of a Pale Blew _Vitriol_;
whereas if upon another part of the same Plate you suffer a little strong
Spirit of Urine to rest a competent time, you shall find the Asperated
Surface adorn'd with a Deeper and Richer Blew. And the same _Aqua-fortis_,
that will quickly change the Redness of Red Lead into a Darker Colour,
will, being put upon Crude Lead, produce a Whitish Substance, as with
Copper it did a Blewish. And as with Iron it will produce a Reddish, and on
White Quills a Yellowish, so much may the Coalition of the Parts of the
same Liquor, with the differingly Figur'd Particles of Stable Bodies,
divers ways Asperate the differingly Dispos'd Surfaces, and to Diversifie
the Colour of those Bodies.",14504,1600s
"To come then to that abuse, of which I am proposed to speak,
namely, intemperance; I say, that it is a great pity it should have
prevailed so much, as entirely to banish sobriety. Though all are
agreed, that intemperance is the offspring of gluttony, and sober
living of abstemiousness; the former, nevertheless, is considered
a virtue and a mark of distinction, and the latter, as dishonourable
and the badge of avarice. Such mistaken notions are entirely
owing to the power of custom, established by our senses and
irregular appetites; these have blinded and besotted men to such
a degree, that, leaving the paths of virtue, they have followed
those of vice, which lead them before their time to an old age,
burthened with strange and mortal infirmities, so as to render
them quite decrepid before forty, contrary to the effects of
sobriety, which, before it was banished by this destructive
intemperance, used to keep men sound and hearty to the age of
eighty and upwards. O wretched and unhappy Italy! do you not
see, that intemperance murders every year more of your subjects,
than you could lose by the most cruel plague, or by fire and
sword in many battles?",30660,1400s

    recent habits of luxury, of expenses, of dress, of indulgence in
    every kind of extravagant dissipation, has to lay to its own door in
    its actual crisis of ruin, misery, and humiliation. If our
    _ménagères_ can be cited as an example to English housewives, so,
    alas! can other classes of our society be set up as an example—_not_
    to be followed. Bitter must be the feelings of many a French woman whose days of
    luxury and expensive habits are at an end, and whose bills of bygone
    splendour lie with a heavy weight on her conscience, if not on her
    purse! With us the evil has spread high and low.",1293,1800s

“I'll run and see how she is myself,” cried Morrice, and away he
gallopped. “Really, ma'am,” said the Captain, “I am quite au desespoir to have
failed in any of my devoirs; but I make it a principle to be a mere
looker on upon these occasions, lest I should be so unhappy as to commit
any faux pas by too much empressement.”

“An admirable caution!” said Mr Gosport, “and, to so ardent a temper, a
necessary check!”

Cecilia, whom the surprise and vexation of so unseasonable a meeting,
when she particularly wished to have escaped all notice, had hitherto
kept in painful silence, began now to recover some presence of mind; and
making her compliments to Miss Larolles and Mr Gosport, with a slight
bow to the Captain, she apologized for hurrying away, but told them she
had an engagement in London which could not be deferred, and was then
giving orders to the postilion to drive on, when Morrice returning full
speed, called out “The poor lady's so bad she is not able to stir a
step; she can't put a foot to the ground, and she says she's quite black

make room for her in her chaise, till the other can be put to rights;
and she says she shall take it as a great favour. Here, postilion, a
little more to the right! come, ladies and gentlemen, get out of the
way.” This impertinence, however extraordinary, Cecilia could not
oppose; for Mrs Charlton, ever compassionate and complying where there
was any appearance of distress, instantly seconded the proposal; the
chaise, therefore, was turned back, and she was obliged to offer a
place in it to Mrs Mears, who, though more frightened than hurt, readily
accepted it, notwithstanding, to make way for her without incommoding
Mrs Charlton, she was forced to get out herself. She failed not, however, to desire that all possible expedition might
be used in refitting the other chaise for their reception; and all the
gentlemen but one, dismounted their horses, in order to assist, or seem
to assist in getting it ready.",7146,1700s

farther on in the same work, he says, ""the spirit of God alone is the
certain interpreter of his word written by his Spirit; for no man

which are taken from his Paradise Lost:

  Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,
  Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
  To their own vile advantages shall turn
  Of lucre and ambition, and the truth

sermon de Viâ Intelligentiae. ""For although the scriptures, says he, are
written by the spirit of God, yet they are written within and without. And besides the light that shines upon the face of them, unless there be
a light shining within our hearts, unfolding the leaves, and
interpreting the mysterious sense of the spirit, convincing our
consciences, and preaching to our hearts; to look for Christ in the
leaves of the gospel, is to look for the living among the dead.",15261,1700s

"From being thus employed,
during the time I served Mr. King, in going about the different
estates on the island, I had all the opportunity I could wish for to
see the dreadful usage of the poor men; usage that reconciled me to my
situation, and made me bless God for the hands into which I had
fallen. I had the good fortune to please my master in every department in
which he employed me; and there was scarcely any part of his business,
or household affairs, in which I was not occasionally engaged. I often
supplied the place of a clerk, in receiving and delivering cargoes to
the ships, in tending stores, and delivering goods: and, besides this,
I used to shave and dress my master when convenient, and take care of
his horse; and when it was necessary, which was very often, I worked
likewise on board of different vessels of his. By these means I became
very useful to my master; and saved him, as he used to acknowledge,
above a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he scruple to say I was of more
advantage to him than any of his clerks; though their usual wages in
the West Indies are from sixty to a hundred pounds current a year.",15399,1700s
"He then returned to the Signory, and implored them to
spare the blood of the citizens, showing the impropriety of judging them
unheard, and at length induced them to consent that the Bardi and the
Frescobaldi, with their friends, should leave the city, and without
impediment be allowed to retire to their castles. Upon their departure
the people being again disarmed, the Signory proceeded against those
only of the Bardi and Frescobaldi families who had taken arms. To lessen
their power, they bought of the Bardi the castle of Mangona and that
of Vernia; and enacted a law which provided that no citizen should be
allowed to possess a castle or fortified place within twenty miles of
Florence. After a few months, Stiatta Frescobaldi was beheaded, and many of his
family banished. Those who governed, not satisfied with having subdued
the Bardi and the Frescobaldi, as is most commonly the case, the more

"'Tis no more now as some fondly imagaine a particular and distinct Language
from others, so that there is but one way to regain it and reestablish it
at least so far as is necessary for a compleat execution of my designe, and
that is to make a judicious choice of all that is primitive and most simple
among the Remains of the antient Language either by considering the first
combinations of sounds or by a regard to the earnest ideas of the mind,
that were apply'd to these sounds; to the end that we may referr thither by
a sequel, all the essentiall and fundamentall words of each Language as to
their fountaine; which admiting of divisions, runnes now in lesser streams
which assume the names of Originalls; because they have their rise from
that grand Source where the first inhabitants of the world ingrost all. So
that it may be truly said of this Mother Tongue that it is in no sense a
part as being really every where either in sums of its divisions or in its
effects and dependances something like your vertues of the elements and the
originall seeds of things, that Subsist not of themselves but in the
mixtures that compose them. I shall possibly be wonderd at, that being able to accomplish all by this
single method, I have not in the interim recours to it, when all other ways
prove unserviceable; But after all, tho this method be perhaps more
ingenuous and of a more profound speculation, it is not however the most
naturall and compendious, be it never so refind'd or accomodate to my

crooked and uncouth road to active at his purpose when the streight lyes

Comparison alone is not (in the opinion of some) sufficient to accomplish
the present intention, however accurate it be; if it want the supports of
_reason_, it may rationally be suspected for being more airy then solid,

unusuall Chances that sometimes produce the most surprizing effects. Besides altho the vivacity and force of imagination be easily admitted into
the relations of the Languages, and leaves there forcible impressions, yet
it neither warrants certitude, nor dislodgeth confusion; 'tis reason alone

escaped.”


§. IX. Seeing then that this Doctrine of the Universality of Christ’s
Death is so certain and agreeable to the Scripture-Testimony, and to
the Sense of the purest Antiquity, it may be wondered how so many,
some whereof have been esteemed not only Learned, but also Pious, have
been capable to fall into so gross and strange an Error. But the Cause

the Virtue and Efficacy of his Death is communicated to all Men, hath

"A short time after the _Spaniards_ built a stately House, which was an
Appartment for the _Indians_, that they might accomplish their
praemeditated Designs, which was thus effected. When they were to
thatch it, and had rais'd it two Mens height, they inclos'd several of
them there, to expedite the Work, as they pretended, but in truth that
they who were within, might not see those without; thus part of them
surrounded the House with Sword in Hand that no one should stir out,
and part of them entred it, and bound the _Indians_, menacing them with
Death, if they offered to move a Foot; and if any one endeavoured to
escape, he was presently hackt in pieces; but some of them partly
wounded, and partly unwounded getting away, with others who went not
into the House, about One Hundred and Two Hundred, betook themselves to
another House with Bows and Arrows; and when they were all there, the
_Spaniards_ secur'd the Doors, throwing in Fire at another place, and
so they all perished. From hence they set Sail to the Island of St.
_John_ with near upon One Hundred and Eighty Slaves, whom they had
bound, where they sold one half of them, and thence to _Hispaniola_,
where they dispos'd of the rest. Now when I taxed this Captain with
Wickedness and Treachery in the very Isle of St. _John_, he dismist me
with this Answer; _Forbear good Sir._  I had this in commission from
those who sent me hither, that I should surprize them by the spetious
pretense of Peace, whom I could not sieze by open Force, and in truth

alone, he had met with a Father and Mother in Civil usage, which he
uttered to his greater Confusion and the aggravation of his Sins. The
Monks of our Order of St. _Dominic_ on a certain time held a Consult

violent a passion for her that no counsel nor restraint could prevent him
from going to the most extravagant lengths in obedience to this rash,

romantic disposition, allowed the young Count to declare his love for
her, either by singing pretty romances under her balcony, or by wearing
ribbons, bunched together in the form of a hieroglyphic, next his heart. Elegantly dressed, he never failed to attend all the assemblies to which
she lent lustre by her presence. He followed her to Saint Germain, to
Versailles, to Chambord, to Saint Cloud; he only lived and had his being
in the enjoyment of contemplating her charms. One day, being desirous of walking alongside her sedan-chair, without

That warn'd me of that dark abyss,
That drew me from those treacherous seas,

To bear me to the upper skies. 5 There from the bosom of my God

And drown the sorrows of my soul. Hymn 2:12. Christ is the substance of the Levitical priesthood.",13341,1600s

                                PREFACE


Among the frequent questions by visitors to the Rocky Mountain region
are those pertaining to the wild animals. What animals are found here? How can they be identified? What are the wildlife problems of the high
country?",59885,1900s

"In which predicament I say thou standst:
For it appeares by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly, and directly to,
Thou hast contriu'd against the very life
Of the defendant: and thou hast incur'd
The danger formerly by me rehearst. Downe therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke

   Gra. Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,
And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord,
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge

"You see, then, that in some words a syllable sounding very much like
_shun_ is spelled

                          _cean_, as in ocean;
    in some it is spelled _tion_, as in nation;
    in some it is spelled _sion_, as in mansion;
    in some it is spelled _cian_, as in physician;
    in some it is spelled _cyon_, as in halcyon;
    in some it is spelled _sian_, as in Parnassian. 10. It is such things as these which make both reading and spelling very
hard lessons for young children. If they think of them all at once, as
the pendulum did of the eighty-six thousand times that it had to swing
in twenty-four hours, it is no wonder if they feel discouraged, and say,
I can't get these hard lessons. 11.",16936,1700s
"They made good use of the advantage this gave them. We were
taken in the rear at more than one point, and Taviers being no longer
able to assist us, Ramillies itself fell, after a prodigious fire and an
obstinate resistance. The Comte de Guiche at the head of the regiment of
Guards defended it for four hours, and performed prodigies, but in the
end he was obliged to give way. All this time our left had been utterly
useless with its nose in the marsh, no enemy in front of it, and with
strict orders not to budge from its position. [Illustration: Marlborough At Ramillies--Painted by R. Canton Woodville--418]


Our retreat commenced in good order, but soon the night came and threw us
into confusion.",3864,1600s
"And when at the close of the dusty day his clangorous toil was done,
     She hastened to meet him down the way all lit by the amber sun. Their dove-cot gleamed in the golden light, a temple of stainless love;
     Like the hanging cup of a big blue flower was the topaz sky above. The roses and lilies yearned to her,
       as swift through their throng she pressed;
     A little white, fragile, fluttering thing
       that lay like a child on his breast. Then the heart of Tellus, the smith, was proud,
       and sang for the joy of life,
     And there in the bronzing summertide he thanked the gods for his wife. Now there was one called Philo, a scribe, a man of exquisite grace,
     Carved like the god Apollo in limb, fair as Adonis in face;
     Eager and winning in manner, full of such radiant charm,
     Womenkind fought for his favor and loved to their uttermost harm.",259,1800s
"“Carl Crawford!” called the president. Carl took his position, and bent his bow with the greatest care. He
exercised unusual deliberation, for success meant more to him than to
any of the others. A dollar to him in his present circumstances would
be a small fortune, while the loss of even ten cents would be sensibly
felt. His heart throbbed with excitement as he let the arrow speed on
its mission.",530,1800s
"_Zonaras_ writes, that when _Michael_ the Emperor was besieged both by
Sea and Land, he was so terribly distrest, that he was forc’d to lay a
Boom across the Sea from _Acropolis_, to a small Town on the opposite
Shore. There is at this Day a Gate at _Galata_, which is call’d the
_Boom-Gate_. ’Tis however beyond Dispute, that _Galata_ was more than
once enlarg’d by the _Genoese_: This appears from the Walls, which at
several Times they have built about it, being fortified on the East by
Double, and on the West by Treble Walls, denoting the gradual Increase
of the Town. You may see at present the antient _Sycæ_, enclos’d in the
middle of _Galata_, situate against the sixth _Ward_, and the _Sycene_
Ferry, all built on the Side of a Hill, just as ’tis represented in
the _Antient Description_ of the _Wards_, except one broad Piece of
Ground, which lies upon a Level on the Shore at the Foot of the Hill. This Tract of Land was at least a hundred _Roman_ Paces broad.",53083,1400s

"We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent
of Africa. (Applause.) Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from
50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue

"LARGE sums his purse received;--the devil went
          just where commanded, and to Rome was sent,
          From whence his highness store of pardons got;
          No journey long, though distant was the spot,
          But ev'ry thing with magick ease arose,
          And all was soon accomplished that he chose. So oft the spark was asked for orders new,
          Which he was bound to give the fiend at view,
          That soon his head most thoroughly was drained,
          And to the fair our lover much complained,
          Declared the truth, and ev'ry thing detailed,
          How he was lost, if in commands he failed. IS'T this, said she, that makes thee so forlorn? Mere nothing!-quickly I'll remove the thorn;
          When Satan comes, present his highness this,
          Which I have here, and say:--You will not miss
          To make it flat, and not its curl retain
          On which she gave him, what with little pain
          She drew from covert of the Cyprian grove,
          The fairy labyrinth where pleasures rove,
          Which formerly a duke so precious thought;
          To raise a knightly order thence he sought,
          Illustrious institution, noble plan,
          More filled with gods and demi-gods than man. THE lover to the crafty devil said:-
          'Tis crooked this, you see, and I am led
          To wish it otherwise; go, make it straight;
          A perfect line: no turn, nor twist, nor plait.",5295,1600s
"Besides, they begin to mention faith,
of which there was heretofore marvelous silence. They teach that we are
justified not by works only, but they conjoin faith and works, and
say that we are justified by faith and works. This doctrine is more
tolerable than the former one, and can afford more consolation than
their old doctrine. Forasmuch, therefore, as the doctrine concerning faith, which ought to
be the chief one in the Church, has lain so long unknown, as all
must needs grant that there was the deepest silence in their sermons
concerning the righteousness of faith, while only the doctrine of works
was treated in the churches, our teachers have instructed the churches
concerning faith as follows:--

First, that our works cannot reconcile God or merit forgiveness of sins,
grace, and justification, but that we obtain this only by faith when we
believe that we are received into favor for Christs sake, who alone has
been set forth the Mediator and Propitiation, 1 Tim. 2, 6, in order that
the Father may be reconciled through Him.",275,1400s
"In like manner, a state that can collect into a bank all the
current coin of the kingdom, would be as powerful as if its capital were
increased tenfold. The specie must be drawn into the bank, not by way of
loan, or by taxations, but in the way of deposit. This might be effected in
different modes, either by inspiring confidence or by exerting authority. One mode, he observed, had already been in use. Each time that a state
makes a recoinage, it becomes momentarily the depositary of all the money
called in, belonging to the subjects of that state.",7994,1700s

"He can only

give him no equivalent in exchange. ----, conversing with Lady ---- to-day, she observed that in early life
conscience has less influence than in advanced life, and accounted for
it by the nearer approach to death rendering people more alarmed, and
consequently more disposed to listen to it. Some persons attribute all
good impulses to fear, as if mortals were more governed by its
influence than by that of love and gratitude. If conscience is less frequently heard in youth, it is that the
tumultuous throbbing of the heart, and the wild suggestions of the
passions, prevent its ""still small voice"" from being audible; but in
the decline of life, when the heart beats languidly and the passions
slumber, it makes itself heard, and on its whispers depends our
happiness or misery. My old acquaintance, Lord Palmerston, has arrived at Paris, and dined
here yesterday, to meet the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, Count Valeski,

"Our
understanding must be reconnected with the very basic measure of
social justice: how many people are able to participate? Our marketing experts tell us that they are failing in their efforts
to advertise to internet users and cultural progressives because this
new and resistant psychographic simply wants to engage, authentically,
in social experiences. This should sound like good news to anyone who
authentically wants to extend our collective autonomy. This population
is made up not of customers to whom you must sell, or even
constituents to whom you must pander, but partners on whom you can
rely and with whom you can act. Treat them as such, and you might be surprised by how much you get

"Edward III., utterly worn out with war, agreed to
a truce, through intervention of the Pope; it was signed in 1375. In
1377, on its expiring, Charles, who in two years had sedulously improved
the state of France, renewed the war. By sea and land the English were
utterly overmatched, and by 1378 Charles was master of the situation on
all hands. Now, however, he pushed his advantages too far; and the cold
skill which had overthrown the English, was used in vain against the
Bretons, whose duchy he desired to absorb. Languedoc and Flanders also
revolted against him.",3840,1500s

"For it is ridiculous that the adversaries should
produce such trifling conjectures concerning a matter of such great
importance. For although the Mass is called an offering, in what
does the term favor the dreams concerning the _opus operatum_, and
the application which, they imagine, merits for others the remission
of sins? And it can be called an offering for the reason that
prayers, thanksgivings, and the entire worship are there offered, as
it is also called a eucharist. But neither ceremonies nor prayers
profit _ex opere operato_, without faith. Although we are disputing
here not concerning prayers, but particularly concerning the Lord's

He came out of the alley, leaving his old shirt behind him. Even if it
had been worth carrying away, Jerry saw no use in possessing more than
one shirt. It was his habit to wear one until it was ready to drop
off from him, and then get another if he could. There is a practical
convenience in this arrangement, though there are also objections which
will readily occur to the reader. On the whole, though the shirt fitted him too much, as he expressed it,

which evidently included indeed lots of bad luck as well as of good,
declining even toward Mr. Mudge and his bland firm thrift, and
ascending, in wild signals and rocket-flights, almost to within hail of
her highest standard. So from month to month she went on with them all,
through a thousand ups and downs and a thousand pangs and
indifferences. What virtually happened was that in the shuffling herd
that passed before her by far the greater part only passed—a proportion
but just appreciable stayed. Most of the elements swam straight away,
lost themselves in the bottomless common, and by so doing really kept
the page clear. On the clearness therefore what she did retain stood
sharply out; she nipped and caught it, turned it over and interwove it.",1144,1800s
"The
year ensuing those _Spaniards_ (who style themselves Christians) came
thither to rob, kill and slay, though they pretend they undertook this
Voyage to people the Countrey. From this year to the present, _viz._
1542. the Injustice, Violence and Tyranny of the _Spaniards_ came to
the highest degree of extremety: for they had shook hands with and bid
adieu to all fear of God and the King, unmindful of themselves in this
sad and deplorable condition, for the Destructions, Cruelties,
Butcheries, Devastations, the Domolishing of Cities, Depradations,
_&c._ which they perpetrated in so many and such ample Kingdoms, are
such and so great, and strike the minds of Men with so great horror,
that all we have related before are inconsiderable comparatively to
those which have been acted from the year 1518 to 1542, and to this
very month of _September_ that we now live to see the most heavy,
grievous and detestable things are committed, that the Rule we laid
down before as a Maxim might be induputably verified, to wit, that from
the beginning they ran headlong from bad to worse, and were overcome in
their Diabolical acts and wickedness only by themselves. Thus from the first entrance of the _Spaniards_ into _New Spain_, which
hapned on the 18th day of _April_ in the said month of the year 1518,
to 1530, the space of ten whole years, there was no end or period put
to the Destruction and Slaughters committed by the merciless hands of
the Sanguinary and Blood-thirsty Spaniard in the Continent, or space of
450 Miles round about _Mexico_, and the adjacent or neighboring parts,
which might contain four or five spatious Kingdoms, that neither for
magnitude or fertility would give _Spain_ her self the pre-eminance. This intire Region was more populous then _Toledo, Sevil, Valedolid,
Saragoza,_ and _Faventia_; and there is not at this day in all of them
so many people, nor when they flourisht in their greatest height and
splendor was there such a number, as inhabited that Region, which
embraceth in its Circumference, four hundred and eighty Miles. Within
these twelve years the Spaniards have destroyed in the Said Countinent,
by Spears, Fire and Sword, computing Men, Women, Youth, and Children
above Four Millions of people in these their Acquests or Conquests (for
under that word they mask their Cruel Actions) or rather those of the
Turk himself, which are reported of them, tending to the ruin of the
Catholick Cause, together with their Invasions and Unjust Wars,
contrarty to and condemned by Divine as well as Human Laws; nor are
they reckoned in this number who perished by their more then _Egyptian_
Bondage and usual Oppressions.",20321,1400s
"The date of this letter may
thus be fixed in the month of September. The fourth (1), apparently written in August, is the most interesting of
the whole collection, inasmuch as it fixes the period of the commencement
of the king's affection for Anne Boleyn. He complains of ""having been
above a whole year struck with the dart of love,"" and that he is not yet
certain whether he shall succeed in finding a place in the heart and
affections of her whom he loves. The last letter (18), which makes mention of the illness of the legate as
the cause of the delay in the affair of the divorce, shows that this
correspondence ended in May, 1529, at which time the court of legates was
open for the final decision of that point. Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, subsequently created Earl of
Wiltshire, after passing many years at the court of Claude, queen of
Francis I of France, returned to England about the end of the year 1525,
at the age of eighteen.",32155,1400s

"Then appeared the section of a dwelling, which was made
to portray the interior of domestic economy, having its kitchen, its
utensils, and most of the useful and necessary objects that may be said to
compose the material elements of an humble _ménage_. Within this moiety of
a house, one female plied the wheel, and another was occupied in baking. The notary, bearing the register beneath an arm, with hat in hand, and
dressed in an exaggerated costume of his profession, strutted in the rear
of the two industrious housemaids. His appearance was greeted with a
general laugh, for the spectators relished the humor of the caricature
with infinite goût. But this sudden and general burst of merriment was as
quickly forgotten in the desire to behold the bride and bridegroom, whose
station was next to that of the officer of the law.",10938,1700s

Faith, nor to promote the Salvation of their Neighbours, nor to serve
the King, as they falsely boast and pretend to do, but in truth, only
stimulated and goaded on by insatiable Avarice and Ambition, that they
might for ever Domineer, Command, and Tyrannize over the _West-
Indians_, whose Kingdoms they hoped to divide and distribute among
themselves. Which to deal candidly in no more or less intentionally,

"Whether of these two theorems gives the higher conception either of the
Divine Being, or of man, I leave it for you to judge. To those old
Alexandrian Christians, a being who was not seeking after every single
creature, and trying to raise him, could not be a Being of absolute
Righteousness, Power, Love; could not be a Being worthy of respect or
admiration, even of philosophic speculation. Human righteousness and
love flows forth disinterestedly to all around it, however unconscious,
however unworthy they may be; human power associated with goodness, seeks
for objects which it may raise and benefit by that power. We must
confess this, with the Christian schools, or, with the Heathen schools,
we must allow another theory, which brought them into awful depths; which
may bring any generation which holds it into the same depths. If Clement had asked the Neoplatonists: “You believe, Plotinus, in an

of. It was on the 7th of May, of this year, and at Marly. The King
walking round the gardens, showing them to Bergheyck, and talking with
him upon the approaching campaign in Flanders, stopped before one of the
pavilions. It was that occupied by Desmarets, who had recently succeeded
Chamillart in the direction of the finances, and who was at work within
with Samuel Bernard, the famous banker, the richest man in Europe, and
whose money dealings were the largest. The King observed to Desmarets
that he was very glad to see him with M. Bernard; then immediately said
to this latter:

""You are just the man never to have seen Marly--come and see it now; I
will give you up afterwards to Desmarets.""",3865,1600s

that first time my wife had come right around, and as soon as I was well
enough we were married. I always said if I could find that Yankee that
shot me I’d like to make him a present. I found out that the great

not a sound audible but that of the sheep-bells in some meadows by the

discreetly as one feels in a silent forest. All of a sudden, we came
round a corner, and there, in a little green round the church, was a bevy
of girls in Parisian costumes playing croquet. Their laughter, and the
hollow sound of ball and mallet, made a cheery stir in the neighbourhood;

Philip was an early riser, and dawn had not yet departed when, fully
dressed, he left the room with the rose in his coat pocket and quietly
descended the stairs. Entering the living room, he found Zarathustra
curled up in one of the armchairs, and for a moment he had the eerie
impression that the animal had extended one of his shaggy ears and was
scratching his back with it. When Philip did a doubletake, however, the
ear was back to normal size and reposing on its owner's tawny cheek. Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, he said, ""Come on, Zarathustra, we're

kinswoman, the Landgravine of Hesse. M. de Bouillon, was, as it were,
thunderstruck; his lady burst out into tears, saying, ""We are all

overturned our last scheme. M. de Bouillon was now for pushing matters to extremes, but I convinced
him that there was nothing more dangerous. Don Gabriel de Toledo, who was ordered to be very frank with me, was very
reserved when he saw how I was mortified about the news of M. de Turenne,

that crop were planted even farther apart so that no crop canopy

even slower rate of soil moisture depletion. On deep, open soil the
crop might yield a respectable amount without needing any irrigation
at all. West of the Cascades we expect a rainless summer; the surprise comes

mighty, shaggy apes lumbering rapidly toward them, half erect upon

Paces high, a hundred of which rise through the lowest of the small
Valleys by a gentle Ascent, the next hundred are almost perpendicular,

gradually to the Top of the Hill, which is sixty Paces in Breadth. This
Hill, on the Ridge of it, shoots Southward to the Distance of a hundred
and fifty Paces, quite from the Church of St. _Sophia_ to the _Porphyry
Pillar_. The other three _publick Ways_, from the Bottom of the Hill,

hundred are a mighty Declivity, so that you are obliged to ascend them

Side of the Clifts which project over the Bay, two small Hills jetted
out, one to the North, and the other to the East; both which uniting
form a little Valley, which is bounded on the East by a Hill which
rises eighty Paces in Height, and has in some Places very agreeable
Descents. This is the Reason that most part of the lesser Clifts, which
bear upon this Hill, stand to the East, and that the Side of the Hill
which looks Westward, is in some Parts of it more shelving than in
other: For its Eminencies falling into the lowest Plain in the Valley,

winds continued I might be a long time in getting to the east end of it,
which yet I knew to be the best passage. In the night, being at the west
end and seeing no clear passage, I stood off with an easy sail, and in
the morning had a fine land-wind, which would have carried us 5 or 6
leagues to the east if we had made the best of it; but we kept on only
with a gentle gale for fear of a westerly current. In the morning,
finding we had not met with any current as we expected, as soon as it was
light we made sail to the westward again. After noon, being near the end of the isle Pentare which lies west from
Misacomba, we saw many houses and plantations in the country, and many
coconut-trees growing by the seaside. We also saw several boats sailing

express sentiments, peculiar to himself, and arising from his particular
circumstances and situation. But when he bestows on any man the epithets
of VICIOUS or ODIOUS or DEPRAVED, he then speaks another language, and
expresses sentiments, in which he expects all his audience are to
concur with him. He must here, therefore, depart from his private and
particular situation, and must choose a point of view, common to him
with others; he must move some universal principle of the human frame,
and touch a string to which all mankind have an accord and symphony. If
